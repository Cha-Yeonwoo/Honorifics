Nice to meet you, I am #@Affiliation# #@Name#
Hello, I'm contacting you because I have a question.
Yes, how may I help you?
What exactly is corruption?
Yes, I will answer your question.
Both spoilage and food poisoning are caused by microbial activity.
Bacteria multiply and damage the original color, taste, and flavor of food.
So this is a phenomenon where you can't eat it.
Then what's the difference with food poisoning?
Food poisoning is a problem caused by the production of toxins by specific pathogenic microorganisms that pose a problem in food hygiene.
People who eat this will experience symptoms specific to that microorganism.
Yes, thank you. It helped me a lot.
Thank you #@Affiliation# #@Name#
Nice to meet you, I am #@Affiliation# #@Name#
Hello, I'm contacting you because I have a question.
Yes, how may I help you?
What is the Automobile Lemon Law?
Yes, I will answer your question.
When purchasing a car, there are cases where defects are found and recurring defects occur.
In this case, the legal provision that allows you to exchange or refund your car is called the Lemon Law.
The law began in the United States and began in Korea in January 2019.
Why was it introduced in Korea?
In 2018, there were a series of fire accidents in #@affiliated vehicles.
The need for its introduction has been raised
As a result, the Korean Lemon Law was implemented from January 2019.
Yes, thank you. It helped me a lot.
Thank you #@Affiliation# #@Name#
Hello, this is #@affiliation#. How may I help you?
Thank you for your hard work. My daughter's middle school is far away.
You contacted me about the assignment problem, sir.
Yes, we didn't even do a fake transfer.
Even though I moved in by purchasing my own home
I got accepted to a middle school that was far away from the one right next door.
I see. You must be really upset.
It's about a twenty minute walk at an adult's pace and it's very quiet.
Even adults have to walk down creepy alleys
I'm really sorry, but teacher, we are #@affiliation#
#@Affiliation# will know better about that part of the complaint.
Isn't it similar or different?
The departments in charge of each are different. Shall I connect you?
Please connect me to that department now.
Okay, please don't hang up and wait. This was #@affiliation#
I will serve you all #@Affiliation#
Hello, this is my first time in public office.
Thank you for your hard work today. What kind of inquiry do you have?
I just found out that there is something called performance evaluation.
I see. You need to prepare for the performance evaluation.
What are the performance evaluation period, items, and documents?
I have a general idea, but there is a problem.
This is #@affiliation#, so it focuses on general public administration.
Should public officials contact other sources?
#@Affiliation# will give you more details

I'll connect you to #@phone number# now.
I would appreciate it if you could do that.

Teacher, how may I help you?
I want to check the school meal support plan. Is this the right place to ask?
I'm sorry, teacher, but we are #@affiliation#
This is the department that handles complaints about educational corruption and educational inquiries.
I called here because the school lunch issue is also a school issue.
Can I guide you to #@affiliation#?
If you call my number, should I call it? It's annoying.
Meal expenses are covered by #@affiliation#, but you don't have to pay for it yourself.

Please wait. Okay, I understand.
You were connected to #@Affiliation# It was #@Affiliation#
Do you happen to know the route of the 200 bus?

I'm really sorry, teacher, but it's difficult to confirm with Dugye Samgeori.
Then, can you confirm the two stations?
Yes, sir, it is difficult to confirm the location of Dugye Samgeori or Dugye Station.

Or is there a department or something that handles that kind of thing?
It is being built with support from the government and the local government.
Have you tried contacting the county office first, sir?
It's military service. I haven't tried military service, but I tried wiretapping.
You mentioned the creation of a mushroom village. Do you have any questions about this?
Teacher, are you inquiring about the scholarship?

Have you spoken to the person in charge?
I think I spoke to another department
It seemed like some kind of refining department or something.
The Cultural Policy Department is in charge of crafts.
At that time, I didn't know about the cultural policy department here.
I spoke to someone and he said he was from a certain department.
He said he would contact me like this, but I still haven't heard from him.
I don't know the exact name of the person who answered the phone at that time.
Yes, of course I don't remember.

I heard you teach with the microphone volume turned up to the max.
I'm worried about the children's hearing.
Is it because of noise problem? Please tell me your requirements
I heard that they are doing some work to reduce noise.
I need to know what kind of construction is being done and when I can get an answer.
Teacher, I'm not in charge of that either.

Could you tell me about your complaint first?
#@Address# #@Affiliation# There is a problem with the press report scrap material.
Which part are you talking about?
We will make the press report scraps public so that the public can see them too.
I would like you to check the quality of the materials.
You are talking about a complaint regarding the disclosure of scrap materials.
One more thing #@Address# I wish there was an education discussion platform
I have checked the complaint. Let me explain briefly.
Maybe you can't scrap it because of copyright issues.
Is there a difference in money?
I'm in charge of general administration, so #@affiliation# The person in charge will know well.
Where should I call
I can connect you right now
Okay, then please connect the call.
Please wait without hanging up #@Affiliation#
Teacher, is this a question about welfare?
You could say that
I am disabled and receive disability benefits.
Is there a separate section called disability benefits?
Yes, I receive it every month.
But that money is a little strange
Teacher, what would you like to correct?
I have a question for you before you go to the city hall.
Teacher, then please tell me what you want to ask.
I want to know what costs the money coming into me is coming at
For inquiries, please contact the welfare team at your local district office.
I've tried everything, but I still have some questions.
Have you ever contacted someone else?
Yes, I spoke with #@affiliation#
Nice to meet you, I am #@Affiliation# #@Name#
How can I help you, sir?
It's nothing else than my husband is in a lot of debt so I'm leaving home.
In the meantime, I think my husband bought two cars in front of me.
Yes, sir. You didn't know that.
But I didn't know that anymore
I got a ticket and various fines.
Yes, I guess you must have been very surprised. So, is this inquiry about fines?
#@Affiliation# told me there are two cars in front of me
So the insurance premium is high.
I inquired about insurance and they said there is something called a scrapping certificate. Is that true?
Yes, this is a scrapping certificate. I'm listening, so you can continue talking.
He said I should just take some of that off.
But I was wondering if I could get a scrapping certificate there.
We will guide you after confirming the institution that can issue the scrapping certificate.

Could you please elaborate a little more on your inquiry?
I will pass this on to the person in charge so he can contact you.
I want to know about the egg shell code announced by #@affiliation#
You want to know about eggshell code
Yes, related information was even sent as a disaster text message.
But why can't I access the website when I try to check?
Due to high traffic, it is currently difficult to access the website.
So, is this why the number of connections has suddenly increased?
Yes, the current traffic has suddenly increased.
Is it because of the disaster text messages that increased?
Yes, I checked and it was smooth until this morning.
It has been confirmed that the connection has not been smooth since 30 minutes ago.
Teacher, is the #@affiliation# website still slow to access?
Should I check with the person in charge of the website?
Yes, please check quickly.
The teacher said it will be restored in ten minutes.
The website will be restored in ten minutes.
They say it will be restored in four to ten minutes.
Please confirm after that
What if I still have trouble connecting after ten minutes?
It is difficult to confirm the exact point of recovery.
So who is sending this disaster text message?
We don't know exactly who the subject is.
Then, shall I call you to confirm when I can connect?
Yes, please call to confirm.
I'm really sorry, teacher.
I checked again and there is a welfare policy department, not a social welfare department.
Would it be okay to connect with the welfare policy department?
Is there a welfare policy department instead of a social welfare department?
Yes, teacher, is this an inquiry about welfare policy?
Yes, because of the recipient problem.
For inquiries regarding basic income, please contact your teacher.
No, this isn't an inquiry about basic income.
Here I am from #@affiliation#
This is where the people who receive low-income apartments and many people who receive basic welfare live.
This is the neighborhood where the girl with the most likes lives.
So, does that mean the teacher will handle the residents' work on their behalf?
Yes, you could say that
Hello, this is #@Affiliation# Call Center #@Name# How may I help you?
Yes, hello, my name is #@name# and I live in Boryeong-si, South Chungcheong Province.
Is there a social welfare office in the wiretapping?
No, that department does not exist
Are you referring to the Department of Social Welfare in Docheong?
Yes, it's the Department of Social Welfare. Is that the correct name?
It is difficult to confirm the Social Welfare Bureau in the wiretapping, but there is a Social Welfare Division
Please connect me with the social welfare department.
Teacher, there are many people in charge in the social welfare department.
Is there anyone you would like to connect with?
The person in charge doesn't know, what should I do?
So what was the inquiry you were calling about?
I have three social welfare related qualifications.
So I have a question for the social welfare department. Anyone is welcome.
I will contact you after confirming the lanka code you requested.
If it is not confirmed, we will check again with the livestock department.
Is it possible to send text messages?
Yes, then I will send you a text message to the number you provided.
Do you have any further questions?
I have no further questions.
I'm curious, so please fix it quickly

It's already been two years and it still hasn't passed.
It was passed early last year, so why was it delayed again?
Teacher, I will search for related information.

Is that so? Then please connect me right away.

Yes, everything you said is correct.
What is your area?
I'm in Busan now
A certificate of cancellation can be issued at the city/county government vehicle registration office.

There is only one farm I buy my eggs from now.

Yes, can we just check the products from the farms that the customers eat?
Yes, just let me know
After checking the code on the homepage
Can I contact you, teacher?
Yes, if you could check it, I would appreciate it.

Then, wouldn't we have to dispose of everything there so that it doesn't become a scrap car?
But I scrapped the car, but they said there is still a lien on it.
Yes, sir, is that so?
They said there was a seizure in Chungcheong Province.

Nice to meet you, I am #@Affiliation# #@Name# How may I help you?
Yes, I would like to report #@address#
Yes, is this the complaint you were experiencing at #@address#?
In Dangjin City, even if you report it, they just say it has nothing to do with you.
Is the city saying it won't accept civil complaints right now?
It is currently outside of business hours and there is a delay in connecting with the person in charge of handling complaints.
Chungcheongnam-do doesn't normally accept civil complaints.
If you submit a complaint, you will be connected to the relevant department.
The relevant department is only handed over to Dangjin City, and Chungcheongnam-do does not accept complaints.
That's why I did it in Chungcheongnam-do earlier, but they transferred it all to Dangjin-si.
Have you ever called us from another number before?
Yes, you just passed it all to Dangjin City.
I have sent a text message to the tourism marketing department for consultation.
Teacher, do you have another number?
I'm not sure if the baby's moms have the number then, but I'll check.
Yes, I will try to connect to see if I can consult about #@affiliation#
Yes, please do it once.
Teacher, I am truly sorry for the inconvenience.
I'm afraid I won't be able to talk today due to a delay in connection.
Okay, I understand. Thank you for your hard work.
Hello, I am a counselor from #@Affiliation# Call Center #@Name#
By the way, I heard that the distance from Yeosuul to the Holy Land of Sili is about five and six kilometers.
Yes sir, are you talking about the street of Sili Holy Land in Yeosaul?
You said it leaves at nine forty and arrives at eleven twenty.
How long does it usually take from Yeosuul to Sili?
Teacher, are you referring to the Sili Holy Land Cathedral in Dangjin?
No, it's the Sili Holy Land in Daejeon.
Excuse me, teacher, but I checked the Sili Holy Land Cathedral.
It is confirmed to be in Hapdeok, Dangjin-si, not Daejeon.
Yes, #@address# is correct
Yes, are you asking about the time it takes for public transportation?
If you make a pilgrimage from this side, you will go on foot.
How long does it take to get to Dangjin by public transportation now?
If you are traveling from Yeosaul Holy Land to Sili Holy Land Cathedral by public transportation
It takes about forty minutes.
About forty minutes. If you walk, it will take more than an hour.

Then, if I go from Yongsan Station to Sili Seongji, what time is it at 9?
Sir, is this a request to connect to the wiretapping department and not the inspection office?
Yes, it's not a car inspection station.

There will be a department that supervises and manages
It's an automobile-related department.
Yes, sir. I will check again and let you know.
Okay, please check.

Teacher, are you asking about the documents required for re-issuing the nursing assistant license?
Yes, I would like to inquire about reissue.

Yes, please continue speaking.
The road embankment has collapsed now, so I can't even go pick peppers.
So you mean the embankment on the road?
Yes, the road embankment collapsed and collapsed.
Is that so? What is the exact address of where the dam collapsed?
The road name address is #@address# and the old address is #@address#
Yes, I checked the address #@ in Hongseong-gun
And I also saw the civil engineering manager at that office.
Didn't the people over there say they would contact you through wiretapping?
I can't even take it to the field right now because it's stuck there, so I was thinking of putting it in the civil affairs office.
Yes, I will check and let you know. Could you please wait a moment?
Yes, I will wait for your guidance.

There was a lot of rain here last time, so there's a part of the dam that's been washed away.
But they said the jurisdiction is wiretapping
Are you saying that the dam was washed away because of the heavy rain?
Yes, the dam collapsed and now the field is all flooded.
I planted flowers in the house garden, but there is a lot of water.
Yes, sir, did you receive a message that I was in charge of wiretapping?

I checked and it turns out that the Ministry of Planning and Finance is in charge of #@affiliation#
I don't know the phone number there, what is the phone number?
Can you take notes now?
Yes, you can take notes
Then I will call you. My phone number is #@phone number#

Thank you, counselor #@name#
Nice to meet you, this is #@Affiliation#. How may I help you?

Teacher, I am truly sorry for the inconvenience.

#@Phone number#, are you a teacher?
Is your phone number #@phone number#?
Yes, that's right, teacher.

Nice to meet you, #@Affiliation# #@Affiliation#Name# How may I help you?

Yes, please take care of your health in this hot weather #@Affiliation# #@Name#
Nice to meet you, this is #@Affiliation#. How may I help you?
It's nothing else than the Asset Management Department in the wiretapping department.
#@Affiliation# It is difficult to confirm with the Asset Management Department, so could you tell me the details of your work?
I will check with the department in charge and then connect you.
What kind of work is it? It's not like we can consult about that kind of thing.
I'm really sorry, teacher.
The phone connection is poor
Could you please tell me again what kind of consultation it is?
I filed for personal bankruptcy.
Have you ever filed for personal bankruptcy?
If you apply for the National Happiness Fund, there is a place where the provincial government provides support.
Would you like to contact the National Happiness Fund Personal Rehabilitation Manager?
Yes, I would like to speak to your representative.
Yes, then I will connect you to the person in charge of the National Happiness Fund.
Yes, I understand. Thank you.
Nice to meet you, #@Affiliation# #@Affiliation#Name# How may I help you?
I would like to know the person in charge of the Planning and Management Office of the Ministry of Livestock Resources Development.
Yes, it is difficult for us to confirm the exact person in charge of the planning and management office.

I will forward the memo to the planning and management office.
Please tell me your teacher's name and contact information.

Yes, I understand. Thank you.
Yes, thank you. Please take care of your health in this hot weather. #@Affiliation# #@Name#
Nice to meet you, this is #@Affiliation#. How may I help you?
Is there no place in Sejong that provides legal aid?
I wonder if those lawyers can come to a place like a local government office and do something.
We will guide you after confirming with the Sejong area representative as a village lawyer.
Teacher, could you please wait a moment?
Yes, there is something that my coworkers do for me every once in a while.
We have confirmed the number of the person in charge of Sejong Special Self-Governing City and will inform you.
Yes, so now your name is #@affiliation#
This is the village lawyer run by #@affiliation# and #@affiliation#
Then I guess I can ask here
Isn't there anything else like lawyers coming out here and doing that?
It was difficult to confirm the parts that the lawyers could provide guidance on while staying separately in the Sejong area.
I think it would be a good idea to ask the teacher if he/she can give you legal advice.
You can ask the city hall if you can get legal advice.
#@Affiliation# I will tell you the representative number
I think it would be a good idea to inquire about whether separate legal consultation is possible.
Let me ask here first. Yes, thank you.
Can that be taken to the village and done by individuals?
I will check the part you asked about and then give you guidance.
Yes sir, I understand
Yes, teacher, I'm really sorry for keeping you waiting for so long.
We checked on our side and found that you need to contact the county office.
To put it simply, corruption is like this.
I called to see if that was okay.
Or do I have to report subsidy fraud or something?
Where should I report this?
Regarding the part the teacher mentioned
You should contact your local city or county office.
I'm from Buyeo-gun, so I talked to #@affiliation#
But in Buyeo-gun, they take it to the village.
The person below just said something like #@affiliation# is irrelevant
But as far as I know, you can't take it to the village and do that.
Did you make a note of the phone number #@phone number#?
Yes, can you connect me?
Yes, I will connect you right away.
Teacher, I am truly sorry for the inconvenience.
There are two people in charge and one is on vacation.
Because the remaining person in charge is currently on a business trip.
I was told that I could call after 5pm.
As soon as the person in charge arrives
I will forward a note to you so you can contact your teacher.
Yes, I checked now. Thank you.
We will contact you at the number you provided.
Excuse me, teacher, but could you tell me your name?
Yes my name is #@name#
#@Name# is this correct?
Yes #@name# is correct
I will forward your note to the person in charge so he/she can contact you.
No more, thank you
Thank you, this is Rural Village Support Team #@Name#
Hello, this is #@Affiliation# #@Name#
Excuse me, but the person filing the complaint has requested a change to #@affiliation#.
Isn't the person in charge at his/her seat?
The person in charge is currently on a business trip.
By the way, the person in charge searched for two people
Is this something that both #@Name# Manager and #@Name# Manager are in charge of?
Yes, that's right, both of you are in charge of that part.
So are both of you having trouble talking right now?
#@Name# Sir, you are currently on vacation.
If so, I'm sorry to interrupt you.
#@Name# When will you be available to talk, sir?
#@Name# The chief of staff went on a business trip to Dangjin
I think you'll probably come in after five o'clock.
Yes, I understand. Thank you for confirming.
Nice to meet you, this is #@Affiliation#. How may I help you?
What number is the agricultural land department there? Please tell me the direct number.
I'm sorry, sir, but it is difficult to confirm with the agricultural land department.
Please tell me the details of your work and I will check and inform you right away.
What is your job? What is the number of #@affiliation#?
We will guide you right away after checking the department.
Could you please wait a moment, sir?
Okay, I understand. I'll be waiting.
Yes, sir, I am very sorry for keeping you waiting for so long.
Due to the current personnel changes, it is difficult to confirm the exact person in charge.
Is this the part that the Rural Village Support Division is in charge of?
I will check and get back to you right away.
Yes, is that so? Then please do so.
Yes, thank you. Oh, yes, thank you for waiting, teacher.
Regarding the change of #@name# you mentioned, it has been confirmed as a matter of business for #@affiliation#
How many direct lines are there?
Teacher, can I take notes now?
Yes, you can take notes now.
I don't know the details, but I think the factory branch probably received some kind of business.
I'm going to borrow this billion dollar.
If you ask the county office, they'll all know what kind of business it is.
Yes, sir. I will check with the person in charge regarding the part you asked about.
I will forward a note to the person in charge so that he or she can contact you.
Teacher, can I contact you at the number you gave me?
Yes, I understand, teacher.
I will forward you the note as soon as I check it.
Yes, when I contacted #@affiliation# and the director, I said the same thing
It's difficult. Should I submit my complaint to #@Affiliation#?
I will forward a note to the relevant department so they can check and contact you.
Yes, teacher, I will wait.
Do you have any further questions?
No, that's why I asked
Yes, I understand. Please take care of your health in this hot weather. #@Affiliation#
Sorry for the late reply. This is #@Affiliation# #@Name#. How may I help you?
Yes, I did as the IRS instructed.
Suddenly I was turned into a dishonest real estate taxpayer.
Where should I go to resolve this?
Have you talked to the IRS?
You only know how to pay taxes, but the problems after paying taxes are not solved.
Then, shall I connect you to the person in charge of #@affiliation# #@name# in the Ministry of Planning and Finance?
What is your number?
My number is #@phone# and my name is #@name#
Okay, okay, I got it. I'll call you.
I hope your work goes well, this was counselor #@name#
Yes, thank you. Thank you for your hard work.
Because I was going to ask about the situation now
Yes, sir, the part you asked about is irrelevant.
But if the girl blocks the call in the middle, you won't be able to make a single call.
Excuse me, sir. What kind of business is this in the village? You said it was a village.
There's a place called Pal Village, and there's a house there that I bought and a warehouse worth 200 million won.
So three people buy a warehouse, but it is not run by the village.
The village chief said that he had the person above him bring it to him.
So I asked if they were going to pass it on to the police, and they said it didn't matter.
Then I said I would take it too, but he didn't answer.
I'm sorry, but where is the warehouse you mentioned?
Could you please explain a little more about what kind of warehouse it is?
The warehouse was built like a factory, how can you explain that?
How can you occupy a warehouse worth this many billion won?
If you think about it this way, if someone asks you what kind of warehouse it is, how do you explain it?
Teacher, may I ask what purpose the warehouse was built for?
Nice to meet you, this is #@Affiliation#. How may I help you?
I'm trying to apply for a permit for that protected marine species.
Is this an inquiry regarding a permit application for protected marine and marine life?
Yes, it is a permit for harvesting or transplanting.
Is this a harvesting permit or a transplant permit?
Yes, it is a permit to harvest and transplant protected marine organisms.
I will check the part you asked and give you an answer.
After asking, I found out that the person in charge is the Marine Policy Department.
I'll connect you shortly.
This is taking longer than I thought.
I'm currently on the phone with the Marine Policy Department, so I'll connect you to another staff member.
Other people don't seem to accept it well either
I'm currently in a meeting with the Marine Policy Department, so would it be okay if I left you a note?
Okay, then please do that.
Yes, could you give me your teacher's phone number?
Yes my phone number is #@phone#
Yes, I will leave a note. Thank you.
How is it okay for a village to be run by an individual?
So then, you're saying to report it in places like TV commercials?
If we do it this way, who will easily report it?
I'm trying to do it now, but if I try to cover it up like this, it'll be like that
Yes, sir, I understand what you asked about.
Anyway, this is a case of negative supply and demand.
It's something that individuals originally built by taking business to the village.
It is not built as a village road, but it is received in the name of the village.
That's why I called you because that's how it's done.
I didn't call the wiretapping office because I thought the police might find out.
We will check with the department in charge regarding the issue you inquired about and then contact the teacher.
Teacher, please tell me your name and contact information.
No, the name on this phone right now is #@name#
Yes, are you teacher #@name#?
Yes, that's why I asked to change the planning and audit department.
I'm really sorry for keeping you waiting for so long.
Yes, it is difficult to confirm from our side.
Because it is currently a part that has been approved by #@affiliation#
I think it would be better to contact us again at #@name#
The person in charge at the county office is giving me a headache
They are saying that it is okay for the private sector to run it like that.
Teacher, if you have any inconveniences at #@name#
The gratitude department is located at #@name#
#@Name# I think it would be better to contact the gratitude department.
I called the audit department and the person in charge of the audit department said
He just said he would run it well.
Why is it that the town received the honor of being run by an individual?
There's nothing wrong with running a town like that.
Yes, teacher, please speak.
Then the police told me to cover up the story.
Nice to meet you, this is #@Affiliation#. How may I help you?
Hello, is this #@phone#? I've been on the phone for twenty minutes.
I just called #@phone number#
Hello, how may I help you?
I've been trying to call for a while now, but I keep getting the same message and it's only costing me money.
I understand why people are angry and swearing #@Affiliation# I wanted to ask about that position
Yes, I apologize for the inconvenience.
Are you inquiring about the location of the Sejong branch operated by #@affiliation#?
I can't hear you very well, but I want to know the location of Sejong City.
I checked the #@affiliation# homepage and the address is confirmed
#@Affiliation# It has been confirmed that Sejong Special Self-Governing City also has jurisdiction.
Then please let me know
Yes sir, your address is #@address#
Could you please just call that big building something like this?
Yes, it is confirmed with #@address#
Yes, thank you for letting me know.
So I'm asking now
Teacher, it is difficult for us to answer your questions about the village project.
It's not wrong for individuals to take over village projects now.
B, So that's what we're trying to find out now.
Then everyone else, you or me, will take you to the village.
I guess individuals can all receive it if we say we don't know about it.
Teacher, I think it would be better if you reported that part to #@name#
I reported it to #@Name#
Just tell them that it's okay to do that.
So, if you ask the wiretapping department and it doesn't work, the individual reports it to the police.
That's how you do village business.
In the case of wiretapping or the county office, it's not something that can be done just by sending it out once.
Teacher, I will check the department again and let you know.
Could you please wait a moment?
Yes, don't hang up and wait.
Nice to meet you, this is #@Affiliation#. How may I help you?
#@Affiliation# Do you have a corporate registration certificate?
#@Affiliation# This is a corporate registration certificate. Is the social welfare recipient a child or an elderly person?
It's not me, the target is an elderly person
We will connect you directly to the Low Birth Rate and Aging Society Countermeasures Division, which has the person in charge of the relevant department.
I will connect you to the Department of Welfare for the Disabled.
Does this take a long time?
The person in charge is away, so I will ask again to ensure accurate delivery of the work.
#@Affiliation# What is your inquiry related to the corporation?
This is a social welfare facility report certificate.
I will forward your inquiry regarding the facility registration certificate.
I will send you the details after one o'clock.
Yes, I understand. Thank you.
I appreciate it. Do you have any other questions?
Yes, it's okay. Thank you.
I hope your work goes well. Thank you. #@Affiliation#
The next train is at twelve thirty-three.
Is this also a Mugunghwa train?
Yes, that's the Mugunghwa train.
I guess it wasn't earlier. It's getting late.
Yes, sir, is that so?
Okay, it takes about twenty minutes. Can I take an intercity bus directly from the Yesan Terminal?
Or which station do I get off at?
Teacher, you are boarding at Yesan Station.
I will check the location and guide you. Could you please wait a moment?
Yes, I understand, teacher.
Thank you for waiting, teacher.
I checked and to get to #@affiliation#, you have to go from Yeongdeungpo Station to Sapgyo Station.
If you take the Rural Community Bus No. 511 from Sapgyo Station Bus Stop,
It is confirmed that you are moving five stops.
Then I guess I'll have to get off at Sapgyo Station.
What is the budget tax office phone number?
I checked the website and found the phone number. Can you give me a note?
You can take notes now
The phone number is #@phone number#. Did you make a note of it?
Yes, thank you, teacher.
And where should I talk about this so that it can be dealt with quickly?
Let me repeat what you said
I think it would be a good idea to get some free legal advice.
Okay, then what's your phone number? It's in Boryeong.
Yes, I will guide you after confirming the number of the village lawyer in the Boryeong area.
Could you please wait a moment?
Yes, I understand, teacher.
Thank you for waiting
Do you happen to know which part of Boryeong City it is?
Yes, it's #@address#
#@Address# The person in charge will confirm and give you the number.
Teacher, can I take notes now?
Yes, you can take notes
#@Phone number@ is here. Do you have any other questions?
No, there is no more
I hope your work goes well.
I'm really sorry for the inconvenience, sir. The connection is currently delayed.
I will give you a number you can call for consultation.
Yes, please tell me the number.
Please reconnect in ten or twenty minutes
Can you take notes now?
Yes, you can take notes
#@Phone number#
The last number is #@phone number#
Yes #@phone number# is correct
Yes, thank you for the guidance.
I'm really sorry for the inconvenience. Do you have any other questions?
Are there no other departments besides the #@affiliated#operations-related person in the Health Policy Department?
Yes, I checked and only #@affiliated#operations are in charge of the Health Policy Department.
Okay, I understand. I'll try to contact you.
Do you have any other questions?
No, no other inquiries
Yes, please connect in ten or twenty minutes.
Yes, I understand that.

Could you tell me that you have received this complaint?
B, I'm from #@affiliation# and I received a complaint like this. How should I handle it?
Can't you just talk like this?
Sorry teacher, that part is difficult
We are counselors of #@affiliation#, so it is difficult to convey the content.
Okay, so should I tell this to #@affiliation#?
These people's business registration should be cancelled.

I'm really sorry about what you said, teacher.
Is the Daecheong Lake you are talking about the Daecheong Lake in Cheongju, Chungcheongbuk-do?
Yes, it's Daecheong Lake in Cheongju.
Regarding that, I think it would be good if you made a suggestion to #@affiliation#

I think it would be a good idea to contact #@affiliation# regarding this matter.

I'm trying to build something like a house.
I'm contacting you now to learn more about that business.
It's hard for me to explain what kind of business it is.
How is that business specified in detail?
Is the business you mentioned handled by the city or county office in that area?
If that's the case, I think it would be best to contact the city hall or county office.

There was something like that before, but does it go into the city department?
The part we inquire about is managed according to the city/county office regulations.

It is difficult to confirm the exact person in charge of the part you inquired about.
Yes, please continue speaking.

There is no drainage facility like this at all.
So even before that construction, there was a lot of water coming down from that side.
There are two drains in the yard in front of the house, but they can't handle all the water.
So the water comes down so much that it just comes into the house.
Teacher, I'm sorry for the inconvenience. I think it would be a good idea to contact #@affiliation#
I contacted the city hall and the local government office.

Hello, I'm calling to ask you something.
Yes, teacher, please tell me.
I would like to inquire about transferring to an elementary school.
Yes, I will tell you about the elementary school transfer process.
Based on the elementary school transfer procedures of Article 21 of the Enforcement Decree of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act
I'll ask you to continue speaking.
A student or guardian expresses a desire to transfer to the school he or she is attending.
After that, submit the address change document to the transfer school.
Afterwards, the principal of the school verifies the residence and approves the transfer.
After transferring, the head of the school you are transferring to will request that you submit your student records and health records.
It seems like there's a lot to prepare for
Yes, I think so. I will continue talking.
The transfer is completed when the principal of the transfer school sends the requested documents.
I see. Thank you for your kind guidance.
If you need further explanation on the answer, please contact us.
This is counselor #@name#. Have a nice day.
Yes, hello, this is counselor #@Affiliation#, #@Name#
Yes, hello. Thank you for your hard work. I have something to ask you.
Yes, what is your inquiry?
Yes, I'm trying to register a business.
Yes, this is a business registration.
I'm curious about the application process
Business registration must be done separately for each business location.
You can apply by submitting the required documents to the tax office in your jurisdiction or a nearby tax office.
Do I have to go in person?
If a proxy applies, the proxy and the principal must bring their identification cards.
You must fill out your personal information and sign the business registration application form.
Yes, I understand. Thank you.
Yes, I'm glad it helped. Thank you.
I'll help you with anything #@Affiliation# Counselor #@Name#
I share a commercial space with an acquaintance.
Can I register each store as a different business?
Teacher, what kind of business are you planning to do?
My friend and I are both thinking about starting a rental business.
In that case, it is possible if you agree to use it by clearly distinguishing the share ratio.
However, this is not possible if the ownership is unclear.
So if it's clearly divided, you can register it separately.
Yes, that's right. Do you have any further questions?
No, I understood because you explained it well.
Yes, thank you #@Affiliation# #@Name#
Hello, this is your friendly #@affiliation# counselor #@name#
Yes, hello. I recently received a gift of real estate from my parents.
This is a rental business, so I want to change the name on the rental business registration certificate.
Should I report it separately to the National Tax Service or something like that?
If the name changes due to a donation, correction of the representative is not possible.
So how do I make changes?
The donor must report the closure of the existing rental business registration certificate.
The beneficiary must apply for a new rental business registration and receive a new number.
Are you saying I should close the business and start over under my name?
Yes, for more information, please contact #@affiliation# or call #@phone#
Yes, I understand. Thank you.
I hope your work goes smoothly #@Affiliation#
I am #@Affiliation# counselor #@Name#, full of happiness.
I'm trying to get a tax payment certificate
But why do I keep getting an issuance error?
Teacher, have you checked the business registration number and other information?
Yeah, no matter how I look at it, there's nothing wrong with it, but it won't work.
Are you a branch corporate business operator?
Yes, that's right. Is that why it doesn't work?
Yes, that's right. In the case of corporate businesses, it can only be issued using the head office business registration number.
So I see why it didn't work out
Yes, thank you #@Affiliation# #@Name#
Start a happy day #@Affiliation# Counselor #@Name#
I changed my name a while ago
But I'm currently running a personal business, so I'm wondering what to do about my business registration certificate.
In case of name change, are you inquiring about business registration?
Do I need to change my business registration certificate?
Name changes are automatically corrected and included in the resident registration data.
Therefore, a separate business registration correction application is not necessary.
Then, if you reissue this, it will come out with the changed name.
Yes, that's right. You can get it issued under your changed name.
Okay, I understand. Thank you.
I hope you have a nice day #@Affiliation# #@Name#
Good morning #@Affiliation# Counselor #@Name#
I'm trying to register a business.
Yes, sir, what is your inquiry about business registration?
Can I use English for my business name on my business registration certificate?
It is not possible by law to display the business registration name in English only.
So, do I have to write it in Korean only?
I really want to do business in English.
In that case, you can write it in Korean and then write it in English in parentheses.
Yeah, that would work
Yes, do you have any further questions?
No, there isn't. Thank you for your guidance.
Yes, thank you. So far, it was #@affiliation# #@name#
Nice to meet you, I am #@Affiliation#, counselor #@Name#
I run several businesses.
Yes, teacher, can I ask you some questions about your workplace?
No, that's not it
I have multiple businesses, so I want to apply the business unit tax to only some of them.
Yes, I would like to inquire about the partial application of business unit taxation.
In this case, it is not applicable except for some businesses.
Teacher, is there any way?
This is possible if the business that you wish to exclude is a joint venture or a tax-exempt business.
Okay, I understand.
Yes, thank you #@Affiliation# #@Name#

Yes, I have a question about fire laws.
Do you have any questions about fire laws?
I want to install a door lock in my terraced apartment.
Are you curious to know if this violates the fire code?
Yes, you can evacuate using the emergency stairs, but you won't be able to enter the hallway from the stairs.
I will check and let you know.
Yes, I want to allow visitors to only use the elevator.
Teacher, I checked and confirmed that according to the relevant laws, you cannot damage the firewall.
But there are cases where it is possible
What is that and how do I do it?
It is possible if you do not use a number or card key for a fire door lock.
Then it's okay to put a door lock on it.
However, the door lock must meet the performance standards of the fire damper.
Additionally, there should be no restrictions on the operation of fire-fighting equipment.
Yes, I understand. Thank you.
Yes, I hope you have a safe construction #@Affiliation#
Hello, this is counselor #@name# from #@affiliation#.
Thank you for your hard work. I would like to ask about value added tax.
Yes, sir, what is your inquiry regarding value added tax?
I am a business subject to business unit taxation.
I don't know how to report value added tax
Value-added tax returns are filed collectively by each business entity subject to business unit taxation.
Then how about payment?
Payments are also handled in the same manner by the business unit taxation application business establishment.
When reporting, you must submit the business unit taxation value-added tax standard for each business location, etc.
Yeah, I get it, it's complicated.
If you have any further questions, please contact #@Affiliation# or call #@Phone#
Yeah, I guess I'll have to call them.

Hello teacher, what are you curious about?
Can I also be subject to business unit taxation?
By any chance, how is the business going?
Yes, I am currently in the simplified tax system.
We will inform you after checking the relevant regulations.
Teacher, all business owners except tax-exempt business owners and joint business owners are eligible.
Then I can do it too since I am a simplified taxpayer.
Yes, that's right, teachers are also eligible
Do you have any further questions?
No, there isn't. Thank you for the guidance.
Yes, I am more grateful #@Affiliation# #@Name#

Hello, I'm contacting you because the restaurant is closing down.
Teacher, what questions should I ask about the restaurant closing?
If I want to close a food business, do I have to report it to both the district office and the tax office?
I was wondering if I should go to both places.
Teacher, your restaurant is eligible for the simplified closing service.
Then you don't have to go
No, you need to fill out a consolidated business closure report.
After that, you only need to report to either the tax office or the local government.
Then, you can close the business and report the business at the same time.
Yes, that's right. Is there anything else you'd like to know?
No, this is what I was wondering about, so it's been resolved
Yes thank you have a nice day #@Affiliation# #@Name#
Hello, this is your friendly #@affiliation# counselor #@name#
Yes, I contacted you a while ago regarding a car urea tank failure.
But I want to know how this works
Is your car a restricted emission vehicle?
Yes, it's a diesel automatic. If the manufacturer made a mistake, they'll repair it for free.
I bought a car this year and it broke down.
In this case, you may request the manufacturer to correct the defect in accordance with relevant laws and regulations.
Correction is required unless the production company proves that it was not intentional or negligent.
But why haven't I heard from you yet?
It has been confirmed that the current defect correction plan has been submitted to #@affiliation# and is under review.
Okay, then we'll have to wait a little longer.
Yes, that's right. Please wait a little longer for a safer repair.
Do you have any further questions?
No, I was wondering how it was going, but you explained it well.
Thank you so far, it was #@affiliation# #@name#

I got an officetel in January of the 19th year.
But this will be completed in November of 2011, so is it possible to renew the rental housing?
Teacher, when is the lease for the rental house being renewed?
That would probably be April of twenty-two.
So, are you asking whether it is possible for the officetel owner to renew the rental contract?
Yes, that's right. If you have an officetel, can't you renew your contract?
I want to renew my contract because my workplace is close to here.
In accordance with the teacher-related rules, the tenant's qualifications will be verified when renewing the contract.
Then I might not be able to do it
Yes, you may not meet the judging criteria.
According to the rules related to the part you inquired about, officetels are considered semi-residential, not residential.
Therefore, you are not classified as owning a home.
Then, there won't be a problem with owning an officetel.
Yes, that's right, but there may be other criteria such as property, etc.
For further information, please contact #@affiliation#
Yes, I understand. Thanks for letting me know.
I am more grateful #@Affiliation# #@Name#

I want to be assigned to the lowest floor first. How do I do that?
Yes, sir, are you qualified to be assigned to the lowest floor first?
There is something like that. What are the qualifications?
Yes, there are minimum requirements for occupancy.
A household with three or more disabled minor children aged 65 or older is confirmed.
Yes, I have a disability registration card.
Then you can get the lowest floor.
In cases where there is no first floor, such as a four-story structure, this can be the floor.
Also, if the sale price of the lowest floor is higher than the sale price of the floor immediately above, it is excluded.
There is one floor here, so the first floor is the lowest floor.
Start a happy day #@Affiliation# Counselor #@Name#
Have you checked the sale price of the upper floor?
I think it's probably the same thing
Then, you can get priority assignment to the lowest floor according to the relevant rules.

Teacher, is this the preliminary lottery lottery draw?
Yes, that's right. I'm a reserve, but if the winners give up, I can join.
Yes, that is correct.
However, this is only possible if the existing winners give up their seats.
We selected the housing supply and residents one-on-one.
Yes, it is possible if there is a cancellation of winnings or uncontracted quantity according to the relevant rules.

It is recommended that you obtain a textbook delivery plan from the company.
Thanks for the guide, it was helpful
Thank you #@Affiliation# #@Name#
Thank you for your kind guidance.
Hello, this is #@Affiliation# #@Name#
This is a school that operates after-school programs through a company.
Yes, nice to meet you. What is your inquiry?
Last year, we were unable to operate after-school programs due to the coronavirus situation.
You must have had a hard time operating due to Corona.
Yes, I am currently in a situation where I need to extend my contract.
We are currently unable to find a foreigner due to issues related to consignment to a native English speaking company.
We are in a situation where we need to replace the teacher with a Korean and adjust the lecture time.
There must be many difficult aspects.
There are so many changes, how should I handle them?
We will inform you in the event that the contracted company has stopped performing the service.
It is possible to change the contract for an extension for the period of suspension.
Please sign an extension contract with #@affiliation# first.
Then, receive an official document with a status report and details from the company.
You can change the task instructions based on the actual report.
Get the revised task instructions reviewed by the school management committee.
You can sign a change contract based on that.
I was at a loss, but thank you for the guidance. It was helpful.
Thank you#@Affiliation# #@Name#
Thank you for your kind guidance.
Hello, this is #@Name# from the Happiness-filled Gratitude Department.
Yes, hello. Can I report my food business here?
Yes, that's right. What is your inquiry?
A coffee bean machine is installed in a small mart.
Payment is made at the counter, and customers press the button and get their coffee.
Yes, in that case, you can operate a food vending machine business by reporting it as such.
Yes, sales are possible.
Yes, it's okay if you charge the cost and let the consumer use the machine themselves.
Yes, I understand. Thank you.
Thank you for your inquiry. Please feel free to contact us with any further questions.
Nice to meet you, I am #@Affiliation#, Audit Department #@Name#
Yes, hello. I would like to ask about the vending machine report.
Yes, which vending machine are you reporting?
Are vending machines that dispense fully packaged candy products when you insert a coin subject to reporting?
Yes, finished products are not subject to reporting.
Yes, the finished product is not just anything.
If there is no additional cooking work inside the vending machine, it is not subject to reporting.
Yeah, I don't think there's any additional cooking involved.
Even if it is not subject to reporting, if there is a violation of hygiene, a fine will be imposed.
Yes, thank you for letting me know.
Yes, thank you too. Have a nice day.
Nice to meet you, I'm #@Affiliation# #@Name# How may I help you?
Hello, I have some questions for you.
I saw a piece of land and it was owned by South Chungcheong Province.
Chungcheongnam-do and this number is #@number#
By the way, what part of Chungcheongnam-do is the part you mentioned?
The land is owned by South Chungcheong Province.
Do you have any questions about land?
Yes, it is land owned by Chungcheongnam-do.
What is your inquiry? Is it related to purchase?
No, I'm just trying to occupy some space.
I heard that the owner of the road is Chungcheongnam-do, but I don't know for sure.
Is the part where the last digit of the number is #@number# correct?
Yes, that's right, that was the back seat.
I will contact the road occupancy manager and give you guidance.
We will connect you right away after confirming with road traffic.
Yes, thank you. I'll talk to you.
Nice to meet you, this is #@Affiliation#. How may I help you?
Yes, thank you for your hard work. A non-profit organization is a corporate body.
They said that a corporation must obtain a permit to own land.
Yes, sir. So is this an inquiry about transfer of ownership?
Yes, I would like to ask about that.
Excuse me, sir, but are you sure you have more than 100 people?
Yes, more than a hundred people
I don't quite understand what you're saying.
Are you saying that you are transferring ownership of land to a non-profit organization?
Yes, that's right, transfer of ownership.
I will check again and let you know.
Yes, that's right. I'll be waiting.
Hello, this is #@Affiliation# #@Name#. How may I help you?
I took the test in Hongseong, and I was born in Hongseong and have lived there ever since.
I moved to Daejeon this year, so I meet the test requirements.
This is possible if the period of residence is more than three years.
The criteria may change next year, so you should check carefully.
Then I guess I'll have to change the address again
Do you have any other questions?
No, not anymore, thanks for letting me know
Yes, please take care of your health in this hot weather #@Affiliation#
Yes, hello. I am a counselor from #@Affiliation#
Are you the teacher who asked about the residency requirements for the local civil service exam?
Yes, that's right. How did it go?
Teacher, I checked and if you are an emergency administrative officer, your expected employment period is Hongseong-gun.
No, I asked about the tax office, not the administrative office.
Sir, are you a tax accountant? I will check again.
You must maintain a registered address in Chungcheongnam-do until the test date.
I think I misheard that if I lived there for more than three years, I could take any test.
Anyone who has been registered as a resident for a total of three years or more is also eligible.
It is confirmed that one of the two requirements is met.
Then I lived from the time I was born until now
I went to college in Daejeon and this time I changed my address to Daejeon.
Still, taking the exam next year is a qualification.
For inquiries in the Daejeon area, please contact Daejeon City Hall.
Okay, I understand. I will contact Daejeon City Hall.
#@Affiliation# How may I help you?
I would like to ask about the qualifications for taking the local civil service exam.
There is a condition that you have to live in that area for several years.
I'm wondering how many years I have to live there or if I have to live there now.
I will check the part you inquired about and then inform you.
Teacher, I'm really sorry for keeping you waiting for so long.
Are you taking the exam in the second half of this year?
No, I'm going to look at it as a tax accountant next year.
I'm asking if I should move the area.
Teacher, if you are next year, there are some parts that may change.
We will connect you after checking with the person in charge on our side.
Yes, thank you. Please connect.
This is #@Affiliation# who called. Minors must be accompanied by a guardian.
But we leave for work early in the morning.
Can my daughter's aunt go?
I'm sorry, sir. Is your daughter an adult?
No, I'm a minor. I'm a middle school student.
I asked earlier and they said my daughter doesn't need to come because she's a minor.
They said that the parent should just bring the documents
Yes, sir, that's right.
What if the parent cannot take it with him/her due to work?
I was wondering if someone else could go
If the parent has difficulty visiting, the minor can visit.
Or, a relative within this village can issue it on your behalf.
Okay, yes, I understand for now.
Yes, do you have any other questions?
No, there isn't. Okay, I understand.
This is #@Affiliation# #@Name# who just called
Are you accessing the #@affiliation# homepage?
Yes, I just got in.
If so, please search for ordinance in the integrated search box.
If you search for ordinance, can you check the local government ordinance viewing system for #@affiliation#?
It says in orange letters #@Affiliation# Autonomous Law
The one with the color in the middle
Yes, that's right. Please click.
So you just need to click on the connected permission
Please search for local roads
Wait a minute, these are instructions for handling administrative work.
I don't think this is right or not
I'm sorry, teacher. Could you please tell me the task again?
#@Affiliation# Only instructions for processing work related to local road management are displayed
Wait a minute, it's showing up when I connect there.
#@Affiliation# I found this about connecting roads and other facilities.
Yes, that's correct. Do you have any other questions?
No, not anymore, thank you
Nice to meet you, this is #@Affiliation#. How may I help you?
Is there a phone number for something like the post office lost and found center?
Excuse me, is this the post office lost and found center?
This is where you can inquire if you lose your driver's license or wallet or something like that.
Yes, by any chance, what region is it?
The region is Cheonan, South Chungcheong Province.
There is no separate lost and found center managed by the police station in Cheonan or Asan.
Only two places, Cheonan Train Station and Cheonan Asan Station, have been confirmed to have lost and found centers.
If you lose your ID or something like that, you put it in the mailbox, right?
I'd like to try something like this
What if the part you lost is a certificate or ID card?
When it is put into the post office, it is transferred to the issuing agency.
In addition, it is said that cards and wallets are sent to the police station.
I know it's a bit inconvenient, but I think it would be better if you contact #@affiliation#
What should I do if I lose my passport or something like that?
If it's a passport, it's difficult to confirm exactly
Because the certificate or ID card goes to the issuing agency.
I think it would be a good idea to contact the issuing agency for your passport.
I will check with the person in charge of the junkyard and call you.
Can I leave my number?
Yes, please tell me your teacher's contact information and name.
Yes my phone number is #@phone#
Excuse me, what is your area?
Here I am now in the #@affiliation# junkyard
Are you inquiring about #@affiliation# junkyard?
Are you inquiring about a junkyard permit?
Yes, I have a question about the junkyard permit.
I will check and call the teacher.
No, there isn't any, please eat
I hope your work goes well #@Affiliation# Call Center #@Name#
Hello, this is #@Affiliation# Call Center #@Name# How may I help you?
There's a car junkyard, right?
Who should I ask about junkyard permits?
Are you interested in licensing a car scrapyard?
Excuse me, but that junkyard permit is a city/county office matter.
Have you tried contacting the city or county office?
Yes, I did inquire, but I have some information to check.
Okay, I will check and let you know.
Yes, teacher, I will wait for your guidance.
Yes, thank you for waiting.
I will direct you to the junkyard permit department.
What is the name of the department in charge there?
The department in charge of the junkyard is the Road Traffic Department.
Who is the person in charge of road traffic?
It is difficult to confirm the exact person in charge, so you will need to check with the department.
I will check and call the teacher.
Do I need to check with the person in charge?
Yes, it is difficult to confirm with the person in charge regarding the junkyard at the moment.
Isn't there a city hall under the wiretapping building?
Yes, that's right, city hall
Yes, then that means the work above is under it, which doesn't make sense.
Hello, I am a counselor from #@Affiliation#. How may I help you?
What should I do to get my certificate issued quickly?
Please file a complaint with the educational institution so that it can be processed promptly.
Since the academy doesn't pay attention, I'm going to get it issued myself.
There are some areas where teachers need to cooperate with educational institutions in preparing documents.
Yes, teacher, what you said is right.
I'm so frustrated I could die
Teacher, how about filing a complaint to the educational institution?
I think it would be best to contact the person in charge of the nursing care at the city hall regarding this complaint.
Then can it be solved right away?
Yes, I will help you as much as I can.
I will connect you directly to the caregiver in charge.
Yes, thank you. Please connect me.
Shall I guide you through the documents required for the first nursing assistant assignment?
Yes, please let me know what I need to do when I go separately.
Yes, can you take notes?
I'll bring a pen to take notes.
Yes, I need an application for issuance of a nursing assistant.
Where can I get the application form?
#@Affiliation# Can be issued on the website
Yes, you mean the #@affiliation# homepage
Yes, first you need to download the form from the complaint form and fill it out.
For details on the contents, please contact the educational institution.
Do I also need the materials I practiced at the nursing home?
Yes, sir, I also need the part about your practical training at the nursing home.
So that the customer's certificate can be issued quickly.
Have you tried calling the academy?
Yes, I called the academy several times.
By the way, what kind of academy did you go to?
The academy I went to was a nursing academy.
It's a nursing school, but it's not a nursing care related industry.
But they just gave them nursing assistant training there.
So, I definitely felt less nervous than at a professional academy.
I'm sure you were worried
Are other students at the academy still not receiving their certificates?
Yes, they are all unissued
Customer, do you have all the documents required for issuing your certificate?
Yes, I have all the necessary documents.
But why doesn't this department go to the wiretapping department?
That's probably because it's difficult to prepare the documents on your own.
But I submitted all the documents to the academy.
Have you already submitted everything to the academy?
Yes, I submitted all the materials you mentioned.
All materials will be at the academy.
Yes, the academy probably keeps them all.
Why did the academy say I didn't submit it?
They said I had to go through some kind of certification process
So I brought all the documents to him, but he didn't seem to care.
Wasn't there any explanation of what that certification process was?
I gave you an explanation, but you still didn't understand.
Did you apply through the institution where you received training?
Yes, I even got a health checkup because my school told me to.
But the academy hasn't brought it to the wiretapping yet
Teacher, you must have been very uncomfortable.
So I'm going to take what I personally want
How much is the certificate recognition fee?
Yes, teacher, the issuance fee is ten thousand won.
Is the certificate recognition fee ten thousand won?
Yes, please prepare the fee and there is a part where you register with the system.
You must cooperate with the educational institution to submit the files for registration.
Cooperation from educational institutions is also needed.
Hello, this is #@Affiliation# Call Center#@Name# How may I help you?
Yes, hello. Do they issue nursing assistant certificates there?
Did you receive your first award from #@affiliation#?
I received my first teaching from #@affiliation#
Is the first region you received the grant in Chungnam?
Yes, I passed the first teaching exam in Chungnam.
I heard that they issue certificates there.
So is the issuance of the certificate new?
Yes, this is a new issuance of a nursing assistant certificate.
Nice to meet you, I'm #@Affiliation# #@Name# How may I help you?
It's nothing else. I'm trying to apply for the establishment of a cooperative.
How do I download the necessary documents?
I will check the part you asked about and give you an answer.
I searched the Internet for the requirements for establishing a cooperative you asked about.
It can be established by five or more people, but there may be restrictions on the business areas.
We will guide you after confirming the institution you can inquire about.
Yes, I see. I understand. Please help.
The person in charge of the cooperative is identified in the economic policy department within the city hall.
I'll connect you right away.
Yes, please connect me to that side.
Teacher, I am truly sorry for the inconvenience.
We are currently experiencing delays in connecting with the person in charge of the cooperative.
I'll send you a note so you can contact your teacher after one o'clock.
Please tell me your name and contact information.
My name is #@name# and my phone number is #@phone#.
I'll pass along a note so someone can contact you after one o'clock.
I hope you have a nice lunch time #@Affiliation# #@Name#
Nice to meet you. I am #@Affiliation# #@Name#. Are you the teacher who called?
Is the region where you first received your forestry technician license #@affiliation#?
Yes, Chungnam. I received it in Chungnam.
Re-issuance of certificates can be done in person or by mail.
How can I guide you, sir?
I will visit you and do it myself.
Would you like to visit your teacher?
Yes, I need it urgently.
Even if you register in person, it will not be issued immediately upon your visit.
Yes, then how many days will it take?
It takes about three days.
It's been three days, I can't help it. Okay, I understand.
Nice to meet you, this is #@Affiliation#. How may I help you?
Yes, hello, thank you for your hard work.
Yes, teacher, can you tell me?
I would like to ask some questions about solar power generation.
Are you inquiring about a business license or support?
Inquiries regarding permits
Yes, I'll help you with your permission-related inquiries.
I have a mountain
How do you conduct power generation business?
Are you talking about power generation business planning?
I'm curious as to whether the companies involved are limited or not.
In the case of Jeju Island, the company has already been selected.
He said he was supposed to do business with that company.
Excuse me, but is your capacity over 500 kilowatts?
More than 500 kilometers and less than 3,000 kilowatts.
Okay, I'll connect you with the person in charge.
If the connection is lost, please call back.
Yes, please connect me.
Nice to meet you, this is #@affiliation#. Do you have any questions?
The class I signed up for is very competitive
Well, it's not like the tuition is free.
Yes, that's right. There is a small tuition fee.
I see, the location is #@address#

Is the annex on the first floor?
The lifelong learning center is on this floor and I will tell you the exact location of the classroom.

Yes, have a nice day.
It was #@Affiliation# #@Name#
Yes, customer, please speak to #@affiliation#
Yeah, I just got off the phone with you.
Here I went to the #@affiliation# homepage
If you want to see education-related content, it says affiliated organization.
Can you see the community at the bottom in the blue area?
Yes, I checked your community
Would you like to enter the community and see the announcements?
You can check the program or how to apply
Is this the information on recruiting students for regular classes this semester?
Yes, it is confirmed that all recruitment is currently closed.
I guess this application will end quickly
Yes, this is a part that is carried out in winter and summer.
However, this semester, which is held in the summer, has ended.
You apply in advance in the summer.
Yes, you need to apply in advance during the summer.
Teacher #@Affiliation# Counselor #@Name#
I will guide you through the homepage path.
Do you have access to a PC?

Search for #@affiliation# on the relevant homepage
Just click on the Lifelong Education Center in the affiliated organizations
Wait a minute, my computer is acting weird. I'll call you back later.
Yes, sir, I will wait.
Nice to meet you, I'm #@Affiliation# #@Name# How may I help you?
Let me ask you something
I saw it at #@Affiliation# At #@Affiliation#
I heard that you provide education as a lifelong learning tool. Is that true?
Yes, that's right. #@Affiliation# It is conducted by the lifelong education center.
So, are you doing the training at the wiretapping?
Yes, the educational institution is #@affiliation# Lifelong Education Center.
The location where you will be trained is #@Address#
Then, the public university refers to the university at #@address#
Yes, it is the university located at #@address#
That university offers lifelong education at #@address#.
It is being held at #@Address# under the auspices of your university.
Then, is there no separate homepage for that?
I'll check it out
#@Affiliation# How may I help you?
#@Affiliation# Counselor #@Name#
The complainant has inquired about the #@affiliation# exam
I will have the person in charge attend the meeting and leave a note for you.
Sorry, but is there an age limit for that civil service exam?
I don't think there is a separate one. The person in charge knows the details.
Yes, please wait for the person filing the complaint. Thank you.
It has been confirmed that there is no restriction on the age of application.
However, the person in charge may not be present and may not be able to give you an accurate answer.
Yes, so are there restrictions on national positions?
I think it would be a good idea for the teacher to check the national position.
However, it is confirmed to be similar to local government.
Yes, I understand. Thank you.
I appreciate it more
Do you have any further questions?
No, there isn't, thank you
Yes, I hope you get good results.
It was #@Affiliation# #@Name#
#@Affiliation# This is counselor #@Name# Do you have any questions?
Sorry, I contacted you earlier regarding the civil service exam for #@affiliation#.
Are there any age restrictions for national and local government positions?
I'm twenty-seven this year.
Yes, teacher. I will check the age limit and then give you guidance.
Could you please wait a moment?
Yes, I will wait for your guidance.
Thank you for waiting, teacher.
I checked by age of application
For emergency rescue, the age of applicants for the 8th level emergency rescue is 18 years or older.
When I checked the age last time, I think there was an age limit
Isn't there such a thing?
Yes, I have confirmed your local government position at the level of 89.
If you are over eighteen years old, you can apply.
Can I help you connect with the relevant department?
Yes, please if possible.
Do you have any other questions?
Yes, I would like to check further.
So, what job group does Seosan City only apply to?
The Seosan City residence restriction applies to emergency administrative positions.
They say it's limited to administrative positions only.
Yes, that's right. Do you have any other questions?
Then, I can support both Seosan City and Dangjin City.
Yes, that's right, teacher.
Teacher, you are in the same series
In other areas except Boryeong City and Taean County
If you reside in South Chungcheong Province, you can apply.
However, the teacher's standard is the year 2017.
So in the year 2018, your residence may change.
Therefore, please check the notice in the year 2018.
Yes, I understand. I will contact you again for further details.
Yes, thank you. I hope you get good results.
Yes, teacher, this is #@affiliation#
I have a question about the area.
Is Gongju-si an address that has been incorporated into Sejong-si?
No, it's just Gongju-si, South Chungcheong Province.
It's next to the city hall.
Yes, I understand. I will check and let you know.
Could you please wait a moment?
Yes, I will wait for your guidance.
Teacher, I'm really sorry for keeping you waiting for so long.
I checked the job posting and it says general machinery in the industrial field.
Yes, it's a regular machine
Only administrative positions must have an address in Seosan-si, Cheongyang-gun, Hongseong-gun, and Yesan-gun.
. In the case of general machines, only Taean-gun, Boryeong-si has a residence restriction.
So, teacher, you are part of the series
Seosan and Dangjin are open to applicants who reside in South Chungcheong Province.
Okay, thanks for the help
Nice to meet you, I'm #@Affiliation# #@Name# How may I help you?
Yes, it's nothing else
I'm planning to prepare for the civil service exam this time.
My residence is Gongju-si, South Chungcheong Province, and I saw the job posting for #@Affiliation#
I am now hoping to pursue a career in general mechanical engineering.
But they picked one person from Seosan and two from Dangjin.
Yes, please continue speaking.
But when I looked down at the Korean file, I saw that there was a limitation.
Yes, there are areas with separate residency restrictions.
Then, in the general machine, there are one in Seosan and two in Dangjin.
Then, can't I apply to Seosan City?
Or is it only available in Dangjin City?
I will check and let you know.
Could you please wait a moment?
Yes, I will wait. Please tell me slowly.
Nice to meet you. I am a counselor from #@Affiliation#
I would like to check the documents
Yes, what can I check for you?
Are there a lot of documents required to apply for a learning card tomorrow?
It is difficult for us to confirm the exact required documents.
You must apply for a card through the Internet at #@Affiliation# #@Other#
It may be difficult to visit, so you should call in advance.
Call in advance and visit
Yes, we recommend that you call before visiting to ensure smooth processing.
Yes, I will visit first.
Yes, do you have any other questions?
No, I have no other questions.
I hope your work goes well.
It was #@Affiliation# #@Name#
Nice to meet you, I am a counselor from #@Affiliation#
Isn't #@Affiliation# the #@Affiliation# that you just spoke to?
Yes, #@affiliation# is the right place to consult
However, it is different from the #@affiliation# you mentioned before.
Could you please send me the information you provided as a text message?
Yes, teacher, if you agree to the use of your personal information, I can send you a text message.
Then you don't have to send me a text message
Yes, sir. Please call before you visit.
You may have difficulty visiting and may need to provide documentation
I think that way, work will proceed smoothly.
I'm going to go and ask about the required documents and things like that.
Yes, I can help you with the instructions. Can you take notes?
Can I check the bus first and then call you back?
It doesn't matter if the counselor changes
Yes, it's okay. Feel free to contact me.
Dear customer, this is a counselor from #@affiliation#. Did you hang up?
No, I'm checking
Could you please make a note for more accurate guidance?
Yes, but there is no bus number 7 at Daebang Station.
Take subway line 1 to Daebang Station and get off at Dujeong Station.
Then, go to Exit 1 of Dujeong Station.
It takes about two minutes to walk to Dujeong Station Bus Stop.
Then, take the number 7 bus from Dujeong Station.
Yes, that's right, teacher.
If you take bus number 7, you will go four stops.
You can get off at #@affiliation#
#@Affiliation# So does that mean there is no #@Affiliation# in Asan?
Yes, it was difficult to confirm in the Asan area.
Yes, I understand. I guess I should go to Cheonan.
Nice to meet you, I am a counselor from #@Affiliation#
Hello, I'm the one who just inquired about applying for a card.
Yes sir, how may I help you?
Yes, because you said you would give me directions earlier.
Yes, the location you mentioned has been confirmed as Dujeong-dong.
Is there a subway station or bus station nearby?
Teacher, where is your departure point?
Let me show you how to get there.
I am leaving from Asan Daebang
Is your departure point Asan Daebang?
I will check and let you know.
Could you please wait a moment?
Yes, I will wait for your guidance.
Yes, thank you for waiting, teacher.
I checked the route with the #@affiliation# map
First, you need to take bus number 7 from Daebang Station.
Just a moment, I'll check.
Hello, this is #@Affiliation# #@Name#
Are you the teacher who called me a little while ago?
Yes, that's right. I have something to ask.
Are you interested in applying for a learning card for tomorrow?
Yes, I inquired about the application location.
Yes, can I talk to you for a moment?
Yes, please tell me about it.
Yes, I checked it on the internet.
However, it is difficult to confirm in the Asan City area.
Location is confirmed in #@affiliation#
Then, even if you are from Asan, can you go to Cheonan and do it?
I checked and it is a section where you apply from #@affiliation# on the internet
However, it was difficult to confirm the request to visit #@affiliation#
Where is it located? Is it Buldang-dong?
I checked the location and it is confirmed as #@address#
Can you tell me exactly where that is?
Yes, could you please wait a moment?
Then I'll call you back.
Yes, I understand, teacher.
Hello, this is #@Affiliation# #@Name#
Yes hello what's up
The person in question asked about the Yesan County Non-profit Foundation.
We are looking for a person in charge of the part where the representative of #@affiliation# has changed.
Could you tell me again where it is?
You said that you are a non-profit foundation in the budget group #@affiliation#
Is this the Yesan-gun Non-profit Foundation #@Affiliation#?

The foundation will change the person in charge of me.
Yes, thank you. Please help.
Nice to meet you, I am #@Affiliation# #@Name#

Then, can you tell me who the person in charge is?
Excuse me, you're coming in now. I'll change it for you.
Hello, teacher. This is #@affiliation#. How may I help you?
Please wait and do not hang up.
Yes, here is #@affiliation#
Yes, I will check #@affiliation#
Yes, I'll be waiting.
Yes, teacher, I'm sorry for keeping you waiting for so long.
#@Affiliation# We will connect you with the person in charge of the social welfare corporation.
Yes, please connect me.
I will connect you right away. I apologize for the inconvenience.
Hey, what's going on?
There is a delay in the current connection, so I will try to connect with another employee.
Nice to meet you, I'm #@Affiliation# #@Name# How may I help you?
Yes, thank you for your hard work. We are a #@affiliated# corporation.
Yes, teacher, please tell me.
I received a certificate of establishment or a unique number.
The representative has changed this time, so I wonder if I need to report again
And I would like to ask if I need any documents to prepare.
Yes, sir
Excuse me, but what is the nature of #@affiliation#?
We are a non-profit organization and a corporation.
Let me check, just a moment
Thank you, counselor #@name#
Yes, we are #@affiliation#
I called back after listening to the explanation about downloading the administrative district map.
Yes, sir. I will check your previous inquiry.
Yes, it has been confirmed. Did you get to the homepage?
Okay, can you tell me from then on?
If you look at the administrative districts, there is an administrative map of the town/village/district offices below.
You can download administrative district images and road network images.
This is a PDF file.
We need to convert
Is this the part that needs to be converted?
Could you please wait a moment?
It's supposed to be open, but it's under the chief officer in charge of the administrative district.
Sorry, can you please say that again?
I just checked the data
I'll check again
Yes, I understand. Thank you.
Yes, thank you for your inquiry.
Thank you for waiting, teacher. This is counselor #@name#.
A route has been identified where you can download administrative district maps.
Is there a way to download it?
Yes, I will guide you. Can you use the PC now?
Yes, I can. I'll open it.
Yes, please visit the #@affiliation# page
Please wait a moment, I'm in
Yes, if you look at the page, do you see the introduction on the left?
Please wait a moment
Yes, I will wait.
I came in through the introduction on the left.
Yes, if you look there, there is a section called Chungnam’s present.
Yes, it is confirmed
Please click on Chungnam's current status
The internet isn't working well, but I'll call you back right away.
Is the same person answering the phone?
Yes, teacher, I will organize the contents of the consultation.
Nice to meet you, I'm #@Affiliation# #@Name# How may I help you?
Yes, I belong to #@affiliation#
#@Affiliation# I would like to ask about the right to use administrative maps.
I'm sorry, teacher, but if you say it's an administrative map usage right,
What part do you plan to use it for?
I'm trying to figure out the current status because I need it for my current work.
Post it inside first
Are you trying to post?
Yes, so I need that information and the original too.
If you need the original, we will check with the department in charge and then inform you.
Could you please wait a moment?
Yes, I will wait.
Hello, this is #@affiliation#
Excuse me, counselor, I have something to ask you.
Yes sir, please continue speaking.
When establishing a corporation, can't I say #@affiliation#?
#@Affiliation# does not have a separate person in charge of corporate affairs.
#@Affiliation# Except for that, nothing seems right
If it's related to your culture, then #@affiliation# is correct.
Since you said diplomacy, I think this is the right place.
But #@Affiliation# has a cultural M-O-U system in Chungnam
Are you checking the homepage now?
Yes #@affiliation# is here
Are you having trouble telling me the exact details of your job?
Then, please check the relevant work on the website.
I think it would be better to call you later
Yes, I understand. Thank you.
Let me ask you something
Yes, teacher, this is #@affiliation#, please speak
I'm looking at the homepage
Should global diplomacy go to #@affiliation#?
But here, the foreign subjects are wrong
Sir, if you are in a diplomatic relationship, is your job one that involves traveling overseas?
The non-profit corporation is a huge non-profit corporation.
I'm planning to move the location to Chungnam Province.
It seems like cultural diplomacy will be divided into departments.
As for culture, I am in charge of work at #@affiliation#
Could you tell me what kind of work you do in diplomatic affairs?
It's a security-related job.
Okay, then I will guide you to the part you need.
Yes, teacher, this is #@affiliation#
Can you please confirm the person in charge of the corporation?
Yes, I'm sorry, but it's difficult to confirm the exact person in charge.
Are you in the arts?
Art is divided into regional and corporate jurisdictions.
Each department is divided into different parts
There is no place that does this all in one place
If you are involved in non-profit volunteer work, there is a designated department.
However, the corporation has people in charge divided into departments that suit their tendencies.
Yeah, it's divided again.
Yes, that's right. So you have to tell me your exact work style.
Then I guess I should go to #@affiliation#
If it's related to culture, please check with #@affiliation#
Nice to meet you, this is #@Affiliation#. How may I help you?
Where is the department in South Chungcheong Province that approves and establishes corporate entities?
The corporate body is divided into departments according to its tendencies.
Are you a corporation with any kind of affiliation with sports, religion, or art?
The corporation is in the cultural diplomacy field.
Is the department you are looking for cultural heritage?
No, it's diplomacy. It's diplomacy.
Are you a cultural diplomat? If so, which department are you looking for?
No, I'm saying we're going to create a corporate body in South Chungcheong Province.
I will inform you after checking the work details.
Nice to meet you, I am #@Affiliation# #@Name#
Yes, I'm the one who just got disconnected on the phone.
Yes, sir, I have been waiting for you.
Yes, anyway, they automatically gave me a license to be an artificial insemination specialist.
I will connect you after checking with the person in charge of artificial insemination license.
Could you please wait a moment?
Yes, I checked with my teacher and he said I have to take the test.
Oh, right now I have to take the test.
Yes, you should take a look, but I don't have any plans to test it right now.
Even though there was such a history before that
Currently, it is difficult to issue with just that part.
Yes, currently it is difficult to issue with only a resume.
You must take the relevant exam and pass it.
What I received back then was of no use
Sorry, that's what I heard from #@affiliation#
Please change that side for me.
I have received a notification that the current position is vacant.
Instead, we will connect you back to the staff member who answered your question.
Nice to meet you, this is #@Affiliation#. How may I help you?
I graduated from a related department in 1990 or 1993.
At that time, they issued me a driver's license.
Yes, sir
It's been a while so I'm trying to get it reissued now.
Could you please connect me to the livestock side of things to know how to do this?
Excuse me, are you certified as a livestock insemination technician or is that your license?
Yes, that's your license.
Did you already receive your driver's license at that time?
Or are you inquiring about reissuing your driver's license?
It wasn't reissued, but was given automatically when you graduated from school at the time.
Since you have completed the course, you only need a graduation certificate and transcript.
Yes, sir. Hello, I can't hear you very well.
Hello, hello, just a moment, I'll call you back.
Yes, thank you for waiting.
#@Affiliation# This is the exact construction plan inquiry.
Yes, that's right. I was doing it in the middle and now it's suddenly cut off.
It has nothing to do with Daejeon
Daejeon has already passed the border.
Sorry about the construction schedule you mentioned.
We will contact you again after checking with the wiretapping officer.
Could you please give me the person's phone number?
After confirmation, we will give you the direct phone number of the person in charge. #@Phone number#
Do you have any other questions?
Please let me know when you can contact me
We will contact you within thirty minutes after you end the call.
About thirty minutes or an hour.
Please tell me your desired time and I will call you at that time.
Then I'll do it at one o'clock.
Okay, one o'clock.
I will contact you again later.
Dear customer, this is counselor #@affiliation#. Thank you very much for waiting.
Sorry, but it is difficult to confirm the exact person in charge.
Could you please let me know again after checking with the person in charge?
Yes, it's okay. I'll wait.
We will contact you after confirmation. Do you have any other questions?
No, I don't need anything else.
To be exact, there is a company called #@affiliation# in Daejeon.
Yes, sir.
From here to the Geumsan military base, the road is all four lanes in each direction.
Yes, sir, it's a four-lane round trip.
From there, is it #@address# or #@address#?
The construction is complete for the first part and this car is not ready yet.
So you're asking about this car construction?
Of course, since the first round is over, this round is also done
Do you have any plans for when that will happen or are there no plans at all?
I will check, could you please wait a moment?
Yes, I will wait. Thank you.
Nice to meet you, I'm #@Affiliation# #@Name# How may I help you?
#@Address# I would like to ask about the construction. I am curious as to when the construction will start.
Are you inquiring about construction at #@address# in Daejeon?
Is the path you mentioned a mountain path?
Yes, that's right, it's a mountain path.
I will guide you through the related construction.
Yes, I have a favor to ask.
I know it's inconvenient, but please contact #@phone number#
No, that's not it
Do you have any inquiries regarding #@Other# between Daejeon and Geumsan?
Yes, that's right, now it's right
Not Gurye-ri Daejeon-si, but #@address#
Sorry, I will check this part again and get back to you.
Could you please wait a moment?
Yes, I will wait. Thank you.
Thank you. This is a counselor from #@affiliation#. Can I continue talking?
Yes, you can tell me.
Sorry, but inquiries regarding this qualification should be directed to the relevant city/county office.
What area are you from?
But isn't #@affiliation# located near this store?
Yes, the call center is located in #@affiliation#
However, the part you asked about is the city/county office in your area.
I think it would be better for you to contact me, so I'll try to help you connect.
No, this is #@address#, but the wiretapping is nearby, so I'm going that way.
Is this the part you would like to visit in person?
Yes, I was told that I had to get my certificate from there.
Then I will check with the department in charge and inform you.
Yes, please check.
Nice to meet you, I'm #@Affiliation# #@Name# How may I help you?
I'm trying to get a certificate issued, and they said I need a driver's license and a photo.
Is there a space for taking pictures there?
I'm sorry, teacher. What kind of certificate are you inquiring about?
This is a forklift driver's license.
Are you inquiring about forklift qualification?
Are you asking if we have a photo camera in our office?
Yes, that's right. I was wondering if there was a camera.
I need to bring two photos so I think I should take them right away
Sorry, sir, but only passport photo machines are installed.
Is it only for passport use? Can't the size be adjusted?
Yes, it is confirmed that only passport photos are allowed.
Then, is it true that I need to attach two photos when applying for a certificate?
I will check and inform you. Could you please wait a moment?
Nice to meet you, I am #@Affiliation# #@Name#
Yes, I was just asking about solar power and the connection was lost.
Yes, sir, that's right. How far have you heard the answer?
I even connected with a local counselor.
Yes, it is over 500 kilowatts, but is it less than 3,000 kilowatts?
Yes, it's less than nine hundred and ninety-nine points six kilowatts.
Yes, I will connect you back to the person in charge at #@affiliation#
Teacher, I am truly sorry for the inconvenience.
The local solar power permitting officer is currently absent.
Teacher, please tell me the number and name you contacted.
I will forward the memo to the responsible department.
Yes, please send it to #@name#
Sorry, is this #@name#?
Then I will forward you a note along with the number you provided.
Do you have any further questions?
No, there isn't, thank you
Yes, please take care of your health in this hot weather #@Affiliation#
Nice to meet you, I'm #@Affiliation# #@Name# How may I help you?
Yes, hello. I'm calling to submit an application for an electrical business permit.
Do you have any questions about an electrical business permit application?
I will guide you after checking the institution.
Could you please wait a moment? Is this a solar-related inquiry?
Yes, that's right, it's related to solar energy.
Do you have a permit for solar power generation?
Yes, your development permit is correct.
Teacher, each region has a different person in charge.
Could you please tell me which area it is?
Yes, right now this is #@address#
Yes, I will connect. If the connection is lost, please contact me again.
Yes, I understand. Thank you.
#@Affiliation# #@Name# How may I help you?
Yes, hello. I called you earlier about a passport issue.
Yes, sir, please speak.
As a legal representative, can you please tell me the passport documents for this village?
Are you the legal representative of the relationship within this village?
Yes, I think it would be good to know.
Yes, I will also provide you with the necessary documents within this village.
The application form is available at the civil affairs office you visit.
Proof of legal representative's ID and visitor's ID are required.
Wait a minute, what about the agent's ID and stuff?
A copy of the legal representative's identification card.
You must bring your legal representative's ID and the visitor's ID.
You will need one passport photo taken within the last six months.
A power of attorney from a legal representative, a stamped consent form, and a certificate of seal are required.
Yes, I understand. There's a lot to prepare.
Yes, that's right, teacher.
The consent form must be completed by a legal representative.
The fee is the same as what we informed you about earlier.
Do you have any other questions?
No, there isn't, thank you
Yes, thank you #@affiliation#
This is counselor #@name#. Thank you for waiting.
Yes, please tell me
We will guide you through the documents required when visiting a guardian.
Application form, legal representative's ID, and child's passport photo are required.

There isn't one for now. I'll contact you when it happens.
Okay, I understand. Have a nice day.
Nice to meet you, I am #@Affiliation# #@Name# How may I help you?
I'm trying to make a student passport on behalf of someone else.
By the way, how old are you?
I'm fifteen now
Excuse me, is this the area where your legal representative visits?
Should a legal representative go?
In case of minors, it is possible to do so within the 2nd degree of the legal representative.
Yes, is it possible to do it online?
You must apply for a passport by visiting the issuing agency.
Okay, I understand. I'll call you back.
If so, what documents does the agent need?
The documents required are different when a legal representative visits and when visiting within this village.
Then could you please explain it to me in detail?
Yes, could you please wait a moment?
I will guide you after checking.
Hello, this is #@affiliation#. How may I help you?
Sir, my name is #@Affiliation# #@Name#
I'm contacting you to confirm.
Yes, I checked. You can take notes now.
Yes, please tell me.
I need the heir's power of attorney and a copy of the heir's ID card now.
Visitors must also bring identification.
Then, is a copy of the ID with the proxy's handwritten signature okay?
It's just a copy of your ID.
Then how can I guide you on the power of attorney?
Power of Attorney Form Please, I'll check it out.
If it is difficult to check on the website,
Can the complainant receive it by fax?
Yes, I will send it to you by fax.
If the heir is someone who owns ancestral land,
Do you know what year he passed away?
And family relationships must be proven through basic certificates, etc.
Well, I'm sorry, but the complainant has ended the call.
Now you asked me to call you back again, can you explain instead?
Yes, I will call the complainant.
Thank you. This is #@affiliation#. Why are you calling?
Hello, this is #@Affiliation# #@Name#
Sir, I'm calling to ask you a question.
The petitioner's spouse is planning to visit the city hall to find ancestral land.
Your spouse has asked about the documents required for your visit.
So, it's not about me, but my spouse visiting.
Yes, that's right, not the heir, but the spouse.
Then you need a power of attorney
You're saying that you have a separate power of attorney?
Yes, I have a power of attorney form.
You will need to get a signature there and bring a copy of your ID.
A copy of the heir's identification card.
If we look at the documents from our side, there must be a handwritten signature from the proxy.
It says that a copy of your ID must be attached
I'm calling because I don't know how to explain this part.
Is that so? I'll check. Can you contact me later?
Yes, I understand. Thank you.
Nice to meet you, I am counselor #@Affiliation#, #@Name#

He said he would give me the documents for reissuing the real estate agent license.
Yes, sir, I will guide you right away.
A copy of your resident registration and a photo of your business card are required along with an original ID card.
It's not a copy of your ID.

The details are a fee of eight hundred won and a postal registration fee of two thousand and fifty won.

#@Address# #@Affiliation# I am a certified real estate agent.
Where can I find and fill out the application form?
If you go to the #@affiliation# homepage, there is a civil complaint form.
You can search for a certified broker in the form and download it.
Can't it be done online?
If you lose it, it is possible
However, it is difficult for the teacher as he is currently in the process of changing his name.
Is there such a complicated case?
Yes, in this case, you must apply in person or by mail.
Nice to meet you, I'm #@Affiliation# #@Name# How may I help you?
Yes, I'm trying to reissue my real estate agent license.
What kind of reissue is it, such as loss, damage, or name change?
I lost it and want to get it reissued.
Where should I call for guidance?
Yes, I will guide you after checking the documents.
Teacher, could you please wait a moment?
And I changed my name, so my name is different.
In that case, I think it would be better if you applied for a reissue of your name change.
We will inform you after checking the relevant documents in case of name change.
Yes, I understand. Please guide me.
If you visit the wiretapping office, you can confirm that it can be issued immediately.
Shall I guide you through the documents to be submitted by mail?
Yes please tell me what do you need
#@Affiliation# You can download the application form for civil petition qualification from the homepage.
There are a lot of documents required. Can you take notes?
Yes, I can, but my phone battery is dead.
Then, would you please contact me again?
Yes, I will. Thank you.
Yes, teacher, this is #@affiliation#. Can I still talk?
Yes, please speak. I'm listening.
Yes, I have verified that you are eligible.
However, accurate confirmation is only possible at a nearby community center.
I think you should inquire directly with the relevant agency.
I understand that only I can do this.
Yes, it is confirmed through the application you made yourself.
Well, as long as I don't die
The only way to restore a cancelled resident registration card is to do it yourself.
Your agent cannot act on your behalf.
Teacher, but internet search may not be accurate
Even if you apply for resident registration-related reports online,
This requires public certification.
Please visit your local town/village/dong community center to register.
Is it really not possible?
Teacher, for exact inquiries, you should contact your local community center.
What if my resident registration card has been cancelled?
Even if it was revived through an agent or public certificate.
If you don't know, you won't know that your address has changed.
I'm sorry, teacher, but I can't verify your identity.
So, I don't think we can discuss this further over the phone.
Hello, this is #@affiliation#. How may I help you?
I'm trying to check if my address has changed, but it's not working.
I don't know which way my address has moved.
Yes, sir, do you happen to know my old address?
I only know that my old address was in Chungnam.
Which city or county in South Chungcheong Province are you from?
No, my old address was Suwon-si, Gyeonggi-do.
Yes, you were in Suwon, Gyeonggi-do.
I don't know where the address was moved to next.
In that case, I think it would be better to contact the previous address.
Can I get an answer over the phone at my previous address in Suwon City?
It is difficult for us to help you with detailed work.
I think it would be best to consult with them directly.
All I've heard is that it's not Suwon City right now.
You wouldn't know unless you took a copy and did something like that.
Yes, that's right, teacher.
Then what if your resident registration has been cancelled?
Doesn't that mean that the address is not registered on either side?
Yes, the deletion is the part where the address is not registered.
Then, can't I use the resident registration of a person whose registration has been deleted?
Can someone else change my address by proxy?
I will check if an agent can apply for the cancellation.
Yes, please find out quickly.
Nice to meet you, I'm #@Affiliation# #@Name# How may I help you?
I have something to ask you.
Is it possible for my address to change without my knowledge?
How should I deal with this situation?
Please contact the local community center in your town or district.
Then can you tell me the address to which I will move?
Sorry, but we can't confirm that part.
Please contact the local town/village/dong community center.
Is there no way to find out over the phone?
Due to privacy concerns, we are unable to answer your questions over the phone.
Please visit in person or call the relevant community center for consultation.
No, I don't know and I'm the one who's stuck right now.
I can't go out and I'm in the hospital.
Yes, that must be hard.
Yes, so how should I deal with this situation?
Is there anything that a hospitalized patient can do?
Yes, I'm sorry. I think it would be better to contact the community center.
Okay, I'll call you back.
Hello, this is #@affiliation# counseling center.
I'm moving and waiting for a daycare center.
Where will you be living after you move?
If you tell us at your local community center, we will help you connect.
Do you also accept applications for this at the community center?
Yes, but you must report it to the relevant community center.
Do I have to report it by giving my children's resident registration number or something like that?
Yes, that's right. To apply for daycare center admission,
Please report to the community center first.
I think it would be better to consult with the person in charge separately.
Yes, then I will move to #@address#
#@Affiliation# I will connect you after checking the representative number. Please wait a moment.
#@Address# Is this the correct address?
Yes, as of August 1st, it has been upgraded to #@Address#
I will connect you directly to the main number.
Could you please tell me your representative number?
Yes, can you take notes now?
Yes, you can take notes now
Yes, this is #@phone number#. I will connect you.
Nice to meet you, I'm #@Affiliation# #@Name# How may I help you?
I am currently sending my child to a daycare center in Seoul.
I'm moving to Hongseong, South Chungcheong Province in two months.
I'm curious about how the waiting list for daycare is there.
Yes, that's right. You can apply at the community center of the town or district you are moving to.
I will also check if there is any part I can apply for.
Could you please wait a moment?
Yes, please check and let me know.
Teacher, I'm sorry for keeping you waiting for so long.
I checked by applying for admission to a local daycare center.
It is difficult to confirm the website where you can apply for admission only in Chungnam Province.
However, it is possible to apply for admission as #@affiliation#
Can I log in there and apply for my children's admission?
Yes, you will see a banner for applying for daycare center admission on your main screen.
Teacher, have you checked?
Yes, I checked. I think it'll work here.
Yes, that's great. Do you have any further questions?
It's okay, thank you. Have a nice day.
Hello, this is #@affiliation#
Yes, thank you #@Affiliation# #@Name#
Hello, how may I help you?
This is a request from the person in charge regarding support for air purifiers in daycare centers.
The last number of the person in charge is #@phone number#. Please call me again.
Yes, I understand. Thank you.
I'm really sorry I couldn't help you.
I checked and it turned out that the person in charge was someone else
Okay, I'll try to connect with the complainant again.
Yes, please connect me with the person in charge.
I would like to ask you about the request for support for air purifiers at the daycare center.
Let's check together. #@Affiliation# is also running an air purifier business.
However, we are not currently implementing air purifiers in daycare centers.
The complainant is currently waiting for a related inquiry.
Sir, can you give me an answer right away?
You're waiting for a call right now
Yes, can you return my call?
Yes, you can call me right away.
Nice to meet you, I'm #@Affiliation# #@Name# How may I help you?
I would like to ask you about the daycare department.
Excuse me, teacher. What kind of inquiry do you have about the daycare center?
I heard that they are providing air purifiers to daycare centers this time.
I heard it's been implemented on other sides, but I'm curious about what it's like here.
You said you received it all at once last time.
Has it already been implemented this month?
Or is there a confirmed date?
I called to find out when the official document would be released.
Excuse me, teacher, but have you tried contacting the city or county office in that area?
No, I didn't. I'm here in Seosan and I contacted #@affiliation#.
But they said that it has to be implemented in the city hall before it can be passed down to the city.
I contacted you because you said that the quick one was wiretapping.
Yes, I see. I will check with the wiretapping officer and let you know.
Could you please wait a moment?
Yes, I understand. Please check and contact me.
Teacher, I'm really sorry for keeping you waiting for so long.
It is currently difficult to confirm the exact person in charge.
#@Affiliation# We will contact you after contacting the relevant person in charge.
Sorry for keeping you waiting. This is counselor #@Affiliation#, #@Name#
I checked the information on moving convenience real estate.
The individual notice branch office is confirmed to be 3,610,000 won
No, what is the total price of the land and the house?
We have provided you with individual public notice prices for the land location.
The price of the house is the announced price
Sorry, but it was difficult to confirm the house.
If you type in the address I mentioned earlier, it will appear.
Sorry, only the land price can be confirmed
Are you inquiring about housing prices?
This section is available in the Seoul Real Estate Information Inquiry System.
Okay, I understand. Thank you.
I appreciate it more. Do you have any other questions?
No other inquiries
I hope your work goes well #affiliation# #@name#
#@Affiliation# #@Name# How may I help you?
#@Address# I want to find out the public housing price.
Is this the assessed value of the house in the area or the assessed land price of the house?
This is the public housing price.
Excuse me, which city or county are you from?
This is #@Address# in Songpa-gu, Seoul
Yes, sir. If so, please contact the relevant city hall at #@phone number#.
No, it's simple. Please check it out on your computer for a moment.
Yes, then please tell me your address.
#@Address# Please check this.
Yes sir, is #@address# correct?
Yes, that's right. Please check.
I will check and inform you. Could you please wait a moment?
Okay, I understand. Take your time.
#@Affiliation# I am a counselor. Thank you for waiting.

What area are you from?
No, then it's fine
Is there a place called the National Tax Service in our country?
When I called, it was not the National Tax Service but the tax office that came up.
The National Tax Service is confirmed to be located in Sejong Special Self-Governing City.
Then, I don't think that's the main number, so please call Sejong City.
I would like to be connected to the person in charge of the tax office.

Sorry, can you tell me again what the disqualification is?
Yes, I have a question about the governor's award.

Which department in the disaster safety headquarters is in charge of each region?
Are you inquiring about the Disaster and Safety Countermeasures Headquarters General Department?
Are you the person in charge of operations and management of the disaster safety headquarters that you mentioned?
Located in the Disaster Response Division of the Wiretapping Department
Could you please tell me the disaster response number?
Excuse me, but what kind of disaster is it?
It's a flood, like a flood during the monsoon season.
Could you please tell me more about your flood-related work?
I'm filming a human documentary on people who do repair service.
Are you filming a documentary on an individual subject?
Yes, this person only does home repairs for the homes of disabled people.
Since filming requires a variety of routes, we plan to recruit flood victims from nearby areas.
Yeah, you're doing a good job, that's why
Yes, I was wondering if it would be possible to recruit people who can film these things.
In relation to this, we will confirm with the wiretapping department and inform you of the exact department in charge.
We recruited flood victims to film a human documentary.
Is this the part where you ask for cooperation in filming while repairing it for free?
Yes, you can do everything from flooded houses to farm machinery.
Okay, I will check with the department in charge and let you know.
I contacted the disaster response team and the person in charge of natural disaster recovery.
But the part you asked about was for filming.
We were told that we cannot provide guidance to those who suffered flood damage separately.
Is there any other way?
Yes, so the current flood damage is in the Chungnam region.
Cheonan Asan area is confirmed to have suffered the most damage
So, is it possible to check with Cheonan Sinchang or Asan City Hall regarding filming?
I think it would be a good idea to inquire
They say that there is a designated area where we can film.
There are reports coming in from Seosan, Ganjin, Taean, Cheongyang, Hongseong, and Yesan.
Can't this be confirmed there?
When you say a report has been received, does that mean you have information about the person who made the report?
Or is it a check of the areas that have suffered a lot of damage?
If we don't hear anything about the extent of the damage,
If you come in, we don't need to know, but
You can also call the local office to apply.
Then, the area you mentioned a little while ago, teacher
The cities and counties corresponding to Seosan, Dangjin, Yesan, Taean, Cheongyang, and Hongseong
I will contact the person in charge again and then give you further information.
Yes, please do that once.
I have a request for an interview with the administrative governor of the wiretapping department.
Have you sent an official letter requesting an interview with your provincial governor?
They said that they would investigate the request for an interview with the forestry chief together.
Yes sir, are you the forest chief of the wiretapping department?
There's a guy called Chief in the forest.
He said he would set up a place for a discussion and end it there.
No, the investigator has to hear both sides and figure out the problem.
I asked them to do so because it is the investigator's job to cover it up.
I am waiting for your reply. I really need this reply.
Yes, the teacher just asked me to make a judgment according to the document.
Are you waiting for a reply now?
Yes, and I saw it too, sir.
The manager is also on the side of the section chief and the civil servants. #@Affiliation# The county office section chief is on the side of the civil servants.
I told them not to do that and to cover up the administrative errors.
If there has been an administrative error, it should be covered up.
Obviously, I reviewed the documents I brought and asked for the other party's documents.
The investigator then asks for an answer to that.
Okay, then I will check with the investigator to see if the response is currently in progress.
Hello, teacher. Is your inquiry related to the experience village?
Yes, hello, I'm calling about the mushroom complex.
The government is taking the lead in supporting the construction of mushroom businesses.
I came there to do farming, but they want to allocate it to me for 400 million won.
That's why I'm doing it with support from the government.
I really wonder if what he said is true
Yes, sir. I will look into it for you.
Yes, that's right, because government subsidies were also included.
They say that if you want to pay 400 million won to receive an allotment, you should do so.
I don't think that will happen, so I wanted to ask in detail.
I will contact you after confirming the exact person in charge.
Yes, my name is #@name# and my contact number is #@phone number#
#@This is my number#. Currently, civil servants have lunch until 1 o'clock.

Yes, I will give you the number. Can you take a note?
Yes, please tell me.

Nice to meet you, I'm #@Affiliation# #@Name# How may I help you?

Boryeong: You must have lived in Boryeong
Taean-do You must have taken the test in the Taean area to be eligible to take the test.
I see, you took the time to find out.
The results of the verification show that only Taean and Boryeong have regional restrictions.
And I have one question. Is it okay to have your address as your roommate?
Even if you are not the head of household, you can still apply.
That part is currently difficult to confirm accurately.
I will connect you after providing you with the contact number you can contact.
Could you please take a note?
Yes, please tell me. I can take notes.
#@Phone number# is here. Teacher, you can contact me here.
Who is the teacher in charge?

Yes, that's right, teacher, and in the #@affiliation# region
There were cities and counties with residency restrictions that required residents to have their addresses in those cities and counties.
What is the city/county where you live?
If the teacher is going to take the test, what will happen to the series or direct current?
I'm preparing for social welfare
Social welfare Are you in urgent need of emergency medical care?
It's probably an emergency.
If it is an emergency social welfare service, we will check and inform you.
Could you please wait a moment?
Nice to meet you, this is #@Affiliation# How may I help you?
I need to find out about this from the central government. Is it possible?
I can't quite remember if this was wiretapping or something.
You received it via phone call from #@affiliation#
Yes, I received a call from #@affiliation# call center
Then it's a place related to public institutions.
Yes, the connection is delayed
In that case, rather than South Chungcheong Province, I think the central government or Seoul City would be better.
Then I will try to connect to #@phone#
We will try to reconnect to #@Affiliation# call center #@Phone#
Yes, the person who called earlier
We are sorry, but it is difficult for us to confirm the counselor you were connected to.
Then we have to start over again
If you know the name of your counselor, you may be able to make a request.

#@Affiliation# The connection is delayed, so I will try to connect with another employee.
Yes, hello, that's weird.
Yes, teacher, I apologize for the inconvenience.
Currently, other employees of #@Affiliation# are also experiencing connection delays.
I will contact the team and then call you.
But in my opinion, #@affiliation# doesn't seem to know my question well either.
Yes, I will check and guide you. Could you please wait a moment?
Nice to meet you, I'm #@Affiliation# #@Name# How may I help you?

Thank you, I hope it works out well for you. This was counselor #@name#
Nice to meet you, I'm #@Affiliation# #@Name# How may I help you?
Yes, I live at #@address# and I would like to inquire about seizure.
You can confirm this by contacting each relevant organization.
Then, go to the tax office or #@affiliated#public corporation
Yes, that's right. It's hard to confirm this accurately.
They say that they won't seize it until you pay it.
Did you receive a response from the city or county that the seizure will be lifted only if payment is made?
Yes, that's right, that's what he said.
If you want to lift the seizure on that part,
I think the teacher has to pay it
#@You can also ask the #affiliation# counseling center if there are other methods.
So, the fact that it was processed as a loss doesn't mean that it was a suspended sentence.
It is difficult for us to provide specific assistance with the business-related aspects.
Then where should I ask?
I will guide you to the nearest #@affiliation# counseling center.
What area are you from?
Yes, I'm here in Cheonan.
I will check your number and give you some guidance. Could you please wait a moment?
Yes, please confirm.
Nice to meet you, I'm #@Affiliation# #@Name# How may I help you?
Yes, thank you for your hard work. I am the only one who is alive.
Yes, thank you. Are you talking about the car that only has the original body?
Yes, there are medical insurance and other things like that.
Yes, sir, it's in the car.
But what if the tax I owe continues to be seized?
Yes, if the seizure is in progress.
I'm wondering if I can get the car deregistered and have it lifted.
It is difficult for us to help you with the part where the vehicle is seized.
No, you can't do that here.
I think you should contact the city or county office where your vehicle is registered.
A, teacher, where are you from?
But they say that it can't be done until the seizure is released from that side.
Yes, you were guided like that
What I'm curious about is #@affiliation# industrial complex or tax office
Whether the amount that was processed as a deficit is maintained
Yes, from the #@affiliation# industrial complex or tax office.
Is the seizure still valid or can it be lifted?
That's why I want to know this
Yes, I will check and guide you. Could you please wait a moment?
Nice to meet you, I'm #@Affiliation# #@Name# How may I help you?
Yes, this is Incheon. I have some questions regarding vehicle registration.
If you are in Incheon, please contact us by dialing area code #@phone number#
I called there and they told me to call for work, so I did.
Did you receive directions from Incheon to us?
No, he said he didn't know what happened in other regions.
So I originally called Incheon
Then they immediately told me to come over there.
Then I will check your phone number again and give you instructions.
Teacher, I'm really sorry for keeping you waiting for so long.
Sorry, but I checked the part you asked about on the internet again.
Because it is currently a government license plate.
Even if you register your vehicle at a vehicle registration office located in Incheon,
It is confirmed that the address is the teacher's address and can be used as the vehicle address.
Then, if you go here, they say you need another document there.
If I go to another region, will the documents be the same?
All required documents are verified as the same when registering a vehicle.
However, if you are visiting Incheon to handle business,
I think it would be better to contact the vehicle registration office located in Incheon.
Okay, I understand. Thank you.
Yes, do you have any other questions?
No, thank you
Nice to meet you, this is #@affiliation# I'm really sorry for keeping you waiting for so long.
I contacted the Climate and Environment Policy Department.
Regarding solar power development activities, this is determined by the mayor/governor.
If you received a response from the budget military, the military will say that part is correct.
If I put it back on the road, will the city give me permission?
Permission is available at the wiretapping office.
But the years you mentioned are limited to development activities.
Even if it exceeds 500 kilowatts, it must take five years.
I was told that development activities would be possible only then.
The fields are so lush and trees are growing, and this is how it is.
I'm asking because you said you were talking about business.
I heard the central government recommended it, but I guess it doesn't work that way.
Yes, do you have any other questions?
No, that's why it's like that
The field is overgrown and unusable, so I wonder if it would be useful.
I called because the vendors told me to do that.
Yes, thank you. Take care of your health in this hot weather. #@Affiliation#
Nice to meet you, I'm #@Affiliation# #@Name# How may I help you?
It's been over two years since I developed this mountain and turned it into a field.
But when I try to connect the electricity, it says it won't work.
Have you heard that some parts of electricity are not
It's been over two years since we developed the mountain. The fields are deep inside the mountain.
When I tried to install solar power, they said it wasn't due yet.
It's been over two years since you changed your purpose.
Are you saying that you heard that solar power is not permitted?
Excuse me, is your solar installation capacity over 500 kilowatts?
No, I haven't done it yet.
Is the capacity you plan to install less than or equal to 500 kilowatts?
Less than five hundred kilowatts
If you are a teacher, please contact the relevant city/county office.
They said it wasn't possible there right now
I was wondering if it had changed again
If you heard that the city/county office said it wasn't possible, it might be difficult, sir.
They said it would take five years
Did you get a response from the city/county office for five years?
Yes, at first it was eight years, and then when I looked again, it was five years.
So I'm confused and I'm going to ask the wiretapping.
I will connect you with the person in charge for an accurate answer.
Nice to meet you, I am #@Affiliation# #@Name#
Teacher, I checked and it also has something to do with closing down the business.
I think it would be a good idea to contact your local health center.
Is this not about corporations?
Yes, it's a corporation, a non-profit corporation.
Are you a non-profit organization? I will check with the person in charge and connect you with him/her.
Could you please wait a moment?
Yes, please connect me
Yes, thank you for waiting.
#@Affiliation# We will connect you with the person in charge of the nursing home for the elderly.
Yes #@affiliation#yo thank you
Yes, teacher, I am really sorry for the inconvenience.
Currently #@affiliation# connection delay confirmed
I will forward your note to the person in charge so he can contact you.
Please tell me your teacher's name and contact information.
My name is #@name# and I'm just #@phone#
Okay, I understand. I will forward the note to the relevant department.
We are truly sorry for the inconvenience. Do you have any further questions?
No, there is no more
Please take care of your health in this hot weather #@Affiliation# #@Name#
Nice to meet you, I am #@Affiliation# #@Name# How may I help you?
Yes, hello, it's nothing else
Is there anyone who can provide consultation on establishing or liquidating a nursing hospital?
Do you have any questions about establishing a nursing hospital?
Regarding liquidation, is it done together or separately?
Or is it one person doing it?
I don't know much about it, but I'd like to ask about Cheongsan.
Do you have any questions about establishment and liquidation?
I will check with the person in charge and give you directions. Could you please wait a moment?
Yes, that's right, thank you
Yes, thank you for waiting, teacher.
I checked the part you asked about, teacher.
For inquiries regarding nursing hospital licensing, please contact the Ministry of Health.
If you are a corporate entity, there is a person in charge in the Health Policy Department.
And you talked about liquidation.
Is the part about liquidation related to business closure?
Yes, it's closed.
I will check with the person in charge and connect you with him.
Hello, this is #@affiliation#. How may I help you?
Yes, in the past, in 1988, it was reorganized from a metropolitan city to Daejeon Metropolitan City.
As a direct-controlled city, there was Daejeon Metropolitan City under #@affiliation#
Yes, please continue speaking.
Yes, but for that part, it is now recognized as #@affiliation#
Is it possible that the three-year residency requirement will be included when applying for the exam?
I was asking about that part
I wonder if it is possible to consider the Chungnam Metropolitan City as #@affiliation#
But that doesn't apply. It's not Chungcheongnam-do.
Now I don't see you as a #@affiliation#
I will connect you with the person in charge for an accurate answer.
Yes, please connect
Yes, I will check with the person in charge of talent development and connect you right away.
Yes, please connect
Yes, teacher, I am truly sorry for the inconvenience.
The person in charge is currently on the phone. I will connect you to another person in charge.
Yes, please connect.
Yes, thank you for waiting.
Hello, this is #@affiliation#. Do you plan on applying next year?
Yes, next year too. Is it possible to check now?
It is difficult to confirm exactly at this time.
In the year 2017, there is a residency restriction
Address on your resident registration as of January 1, 2017 #@Affiliation#
The total period of time that you have been in office must be at least three years.
From before January 1st, 2017 until the final exam date.
#@Affiliation# Must be a person with a registered address
During this period, the resident registration was cancelled and the residence was unknown.
It is confirmed that the part where the registration is required
It is still difficult to confirm the exact residency restriction criteria for next year.
Yes, then when you apply the original criteria
How long did you live in Daejeon Metropolitan City, i.e. #@affiliation# Daejeon Metropolitan City?
#@Affiliation# Is it included in the residence? Is it included within three years?
I will check that part and let you know.
Could you please wait a moment?
Yes, I will wait for your guidance.
Yes, teacher, I'm really sorry for keeping you waiting for so long.
The Daejeon area you asked about seems difficult
As the administrative district changed to Daejeon
#@Affiliation# The period of residence in Daejeon while affiliated is not included.
Yes, then is this the part that doesn't work?
That part is in #@affiliation# Daejeon Metropolitan City
I will connect you with the person in charge for an accurate answer.
Nice to meet you, this is #@Affiliation#. How may I help you?
Yes, I have something to ask.
Yes, please tell me your inquiry.
Yes, I would like to inquire about regional qualifications for the civil service examination.
Teacher, is this related to the residency restriction?
Yes, I understand that it says that three years of residency is required.
In the past, Daejeon was under #@affiliation#
I was wondering if that was also included since it was also #@affiliation#
Teacher, do you currently live in the Daejeon area?
No, I'm in Gongju right now.
I'm just thinking about moving to Daejeon.
I haven't even lived in Gongju for three years.
Yes, please continue speaking.
In the past, during the Daejeon era, when Daejeon was under the #@affiliation#
I was in Daejeon at that time
So I was wondering if the period I was in Daejeon at that time was included.
Teacher, are you planning to take the exam next year?
Yes, next year too. Is it possible to check now?
I will check that part and let you know.
Nice to meet you, I'm #@Affiliation# #@Name#. I'll tell you more.

No, I am a civil engineer.
Then I will check with the civil engineering department and inform you.
For civil engineering, please check the page under facility in the second chapter.
Yes, construction civil engineering and architecture, and Cheonan and Cheonan City.
It looks like Gyeryong City is really popular. Chungcheongnam-do has six people.
Yes, that's right. Have you checked the contents? Do you have any other questions?
Yes, thank you. I checked it. No, I have no other questions.
Yes, I hope you get good results.
Nice to meet you, I'm #@Affiliation# #@Name# How may I help you?
I'm thinking about taking the civil service exam, but I'm wondering how many people they hire from local areas.

Please download the form, fill it out, and provide your contact information.

Oh, thank you for letting me know. Thank you.
I appreciate it. Do you have any other questions?
No, no other inquiries
I hope your work goes well #@Affiliation#
Nice to meet you, this is #@Affiliation#. How may I help you?
Yes, I was wondering how many firefighters are being hired this year.
Yes, there is a fire department website. You can go there and check.
Yes, go to the fire department website.
Yes, you can check the recruitment information in the recruitment section of the fire department.
Yes, then is it possible to issue a firefighter exam certificate?
Yes, I will check with the person in charge and inform you about the certificate.
Could you please wait a moment, sir?
Yes, please check. Thank you.
Yes, thank you for waiting, teacher.
I will give you the phone number of the person in charge of recruiting firefighters at the Fire Administration Division.
Can you take notes now?
Yes, please call me so I can take notes.
Yes, I will call you. #@Phone#
Yes, thank you, I noted it.
Yes, you can connect directly
It fits the fire administration.
Yes, that's right. You can contact the Fire Administration Department.
Yes, thank you. Please connect.
Yes, I will connect you right away.
Nice to meet you, this is #@Affiliation#. How may I help you?
Yes, has there been an announcement of successful firefighters?
I will check and inform you about the announcement of successful applicants for the firefighter exam.
Could you please wait a moment, sir?
Yes, you can speak slowly.
Yes, thank you for waiting, teacher.
I checked the #@affiliation# firefighter homepage
The final list of successful candidates and candidate registration was announced on July 20th.
Is there a difference between a successful candidate and a candidate?
Yes, it has been confirmed that you must pass and register as a candidate.
You can check there
I'm doing this because I want to get a certificate.
Are you looking to receive a certificate of completion?
In that case, I think it would be best to contact that department regarding the certificate of qualification.
I'll connect you right away
Where was the homepage you said earlier?
Your homepage is #@affiliation#
Hello, I can't hear you very well.
Yes, can you hear me now? This is the Fire Department homepage.
Yes I can hear you. Please continue speaking.
Hello, I am a counselor from #@Affiliation#. How may I help you?
I recently produced acorn powder. Do I need to report it before distributing it?
I'm sorry, teacher, but could you please say that again?
Yes, we produce other types of products.
Are you producing other types of products?
I will check if there is a wiretapping officer and let you know.
Could you please wait a moment?
I'm really sorry for keeping you waiting for so long.
It was difficult to confirm the person in charge of wiretapping with the work that the teacher told me about.
You said it was a general category, but is it not related to livestock?
No, it's acorn powder.
If you have acorn powder, are you in the agricultural field, sir?
Yes, we are here in Seokcheon.
#@Affiliation#When I ask the county office, they are all elderly, so the answers are a bit ambiguous.
Is that so? Then I will check again and let you know.
Could you please wait a moment?
We will connect you to the distribution support team at #@affiliation# and provide guidance.
I'll connect you right away, teacher.
Nice to meet you, this is #@Affiliation#. How may I help you?
Yes, I have a question about your business registration certificate. Can I ask you something?
If it's a business report, is it related to a permit?
Yes, it has to do with permission and changes.
Permits are handled by the city hall's main office.
Therefore, if you contact the relevant agency, you will probably be able to get an accurate answer.
Teacher, where are you from?
Okay, so then I can't get an answer from the district office?
I called because I thought I'd get a more accurate answer.
What kind of permission is this, sir?
We are a business that currently does consignment processing.
The CEO is the same, but there are two corporations.
Only intermediate factories entrust consignment processing to this factory.
And then we bring it back and produce it in a way that it can be made again.
I wonder if it is really necessary to specify that part
It is difficult for us to confirm the business-related part.
You said it was consignment processing, but can you tell me what kind of consignment processing it was?
We are currently producing other types of products.
I will check if there is a wiretapping officer and let you know.
Nice to meet you, this is #@Affiliation#. How may I help you?
Yes, I got my electrician's license, but I want to reissue it.
Yes, I need one photo of your business card and the issuance fee of four thousand and twenty won.
The fee is two thousand won and the registration fee after issuing the certificate is two thousand twenty won.
Please go to the post office and exchange the money for standard currency.
Please send it enclosed
Then, what department should I visit to get it reissued?
Yes, teacher, I will give you the address to send it to.
Please send it to the person in charge at #@Address# #@Affiliation#
Yes, can I visit and take a photo of my business card there?
Or should I take a picture and take it with me?
Sorry, but you need to prepare a photo.
Okay, I understand. I will do that.
If I have all the required documents, can I get it issued right away?
I will check that part and let you know.
Could you please wait a moment?
Yes, I will wait. Please guide me.
Thank you for waiting, teacher.
I checked and it can be issued immediately upon visit.
When receiving by mail, it is difficult to confirm the exact period depending on the number of days required for sending.
Okay, I understand. I will visit.
Yes sir your zip code is #@number#
Yes, thank you for your help.
Yes, do you have any other questions?
No, thank you, counselor.
Yes, thank you #@Affiliation# #@Name#
Nice to meet you, I'm #@Affiliation# #@Name# How may I help you?
Yes, I would like to apply for re-issuance of my nursing assistant certificate.
If you have any questions about reissuing your nursing caregiver certificate, please contact us.
We can also provide guidance on required documents.
Yes, please guide me.
Teacher, I will check and inform you.
Could you please wait a moment?
Yes, thank you. I will wait.
Thank you for waiting, teacher.
Before I guide you through the required documents, I would like to ask you one thing.
Is the region you first received the grant from #@affiliation#?
Yes, #@affiliation# is correct
Yes, sir, and may I ask you the reason for the reissue?
I'm trying to work as a caregiver, but I lost my license.
I see you lost it. I will guide you through the required documents.
Yes, please guide me.
There are two methods of application: in person application and mail application.
How can I guide you?
I would like to request that you submit it by mail.
Yes, I will guide you through the required documents for mail reception.
Yes, please do so.
Yes, sir, first I need your ID and a reissue application form.
The application form can be downloaded from the civil complaint form on the #@affiliation# website.
Nice to meet you, this is #@Affiliation#. How may I help you?
I want to make a passport for my daughter. What do I need?
First, the legal representative or parent must visit with an ID card.
You can fill out the application form by visiting us.
And you will need two passport photos taken within the last six months.
If you prepare some extra photos, we can process your work more smoothly.
We need your child's English name and proof of address for registration.
You don't need a family relationship certificate or anything like that.
Just check your address and come visit us.
Fees vary depending on the child's age.
How old is your child?
I'm in the first grade of elementary school. Can I get 8 inches?
Or do you only go to six?
It may depend on your birthday, but what year are you born in?
#@Identity# Please confirm with this
Yes, I will check.
Teacher, if you are under 8 years old, please confirm that you are under 8 years old.
Thirty-eight sides are thirty-three thousand won, and twenty-four sides are thirty thousand won.
And a single-entry passport that can be used once a year costs this much
Yes, I understand. Thank you.
Do you have any other questions?
Yes, it's okay, thank you
Thank you, counselor #@name#
Nice to meet you, I'm #@Affiliation# #@Name# How may I help you?
I would like to get my passport reissued. I would like to know where to go.
I looked it up and it says that the store is going to #@affiliation# wiretapping
Yes, that's right. You can visit the county or provincial government offices.
Then, which of the two should Maepo New Towns go to?
Yes, you can visit the wiretapping office.
The wiretapping is in the store, right?
Yes, that's right, teacher.
Then, can you tell me which floor it is?
Please visit the information desk on the first floor of the main building.
Then, the civil affairs office listed here cannot handle that work.
Yes, the civil affairs office is difficult, so you have to visit the city hall.
Then let me ask you one more question.
Yes, please tell me
Is there a place where I can take a new passport photo when issuing a passport?
Yes, you can take pictures, sir.
Yes, I understand. Thank you for your guidance.
Teacher, please make sure to bring your passport and ID card with you.
If this is your first time receiving something for your child, is there anything special for children?
I will guide you through the documents, sir.
Yes, thank you. Please tell me.
Instead, I received #@Affiliation# #@Name#
Hello, this is #@Affiliation# #@Name#
Yeah, what's going on?
Excuse me, but isn't #@Name# in charge?
I'm in a meeting with another department right now. Do you need notes?
Yes, please pass on the note.
Yes, please tell me.
The petitioner inquired about registering a general construction business and asked to be contacted by the person in charge.
I will tell you the complainant's phone number. It is #@phone number#.
I'll check #@Phone#, is it correct?
Yes, that number is correct
What is the name of the complainant?
#@Name# is here. Do you need anything else?
No, I don't need anything else
Yes, please pass it on. Thank you for your hard work.
Yes, hello, this is #@Affiliation# #@Name#
This is #@Affiliation# #@Name# who contacted you a little while ago.
Yes, what kind of work is this that is causing you to contact me?
I just got a call from the person in charge saying he was out of the office.
We have informed the complainant of the matter.
The person in charge requested that the complainant deliver a note regarding contact.
Could you please take a note?
Yes, please call me right away.
Your name is #@Name# and your phone number is #@Phone#
The inquiry was about registering a business for the disabled.
Okay, I understand. I'll pass it on to you.
Yes, thank you. Have a nice day.
Hello, this is #@affiliation#. How may I help you?
Hello, I am from #@affiliation#. The person filing the complaint is looking for the person in charge.
Yes, what's going on?
When will you be able to speak to the manager?
He's gone out for a moment now, but I think it'll take about fifteen minutes.
Okay, I understand. I will inform the complainant that the connection is delayed.
Hello, the manager is currently handling another call.
I will tell the complainant that the work is delayed and give him/her the contact information of the person in charge.
Your supervisor's phone number is #@phone#
Excuse me, but could you tell me your name as well?
#@Name# This is the chief officer. Is it okay?
Yes, I will forward a note containing the relevant information to the complainant.
Yes, I understand. Thank you.

Yes, I'm trying to register a disabled person's business.
We will provide guidance after confirming with the person in charge of registration of disabled business.
Could you please wait a moment?
Sorry, but it is currently difficult to confirm the person in charge of the relevant work at #@Affiliation#
Only the support person can check, but I will connect after I inquire.
Hello, I am a counselor from #@affiliation#
Yes, how did you confirm it?
You requested a connection regarding registration as a disabled person's business.
Yeah I asked you to find out what's going on.
The person in charge is away, so there is a delay in connecting.
I see, that could be the case.
Hello, I am #@Affiliation#Counselor #@Name#. How may I help you?
Yes, I am the president of #@name#
Yes, thank you for checking. Excuse me, what corporation are you?
We are a manufacturing company that manufactures our installation equipment.
Are you construction equipment?
No, it's a display device.
Yes, thank you for your confirmation, sir.
I will check with the wiretapping department and call you back.
Yes, I understand. Thank you.
Yes, thank you too. Do you have any other questions?
No, there is no more
I hope your work goes well #@Affiliation# #@Name#
Nice to meet you. I am #@Affiliation# #@Name#. How may I help you?
Thank you for your hard work. I called to ask you something.
We are a corporation currently located in Asan, Chungcheongbuk-do.
We are planning to build a house for our employees' welfare.
But I contacted you because I wanted to know about the administrative procedures related to housing cooperatives.
Yes, sir, it is a corporation located in Asan and it is for employee welfare.
Are you planning to build a house and have questions about the administrative procedures for the housing cooperative?
Yes, that's right, I have a question for you.
Excuse me, but have you tried contacting #@affiliation#?
No, I called you first here at #@Affiliation#
Then I will check with the department and call you back.
Yes, can I leave my cell phone number?
Yes, teacher, please tell me what you want to say.
Yes, #@phone number# is fine.
Nice to meet you, I'm #@Affiliation# #@Name# How may I help you?
Yes, I would like to ask you about your move-in report.
Yes, are you talking about the move-in report? I will tell you what is required.
Yeah what do you need
First of all, you need your teacher's personal stamp.
Any of my stamps are fine
Any personal stamp is possible
That's different from a seal stamp.
Yes, that's right, teacher.
Okay, I understand. Is there anything else?
And if you report a change of address, your household will be separated.
So, are there any problems that arise?
For example, my parents are both retired now.
I don't know how health insurance works
You don't have to live together to get health insurance benefits.
For inquiries regarding health insurance benefits, please contact #@affiliation#
Okay, I understand.
Yes, do you have any other questions?
No, it's okay, thank you
Yes, have a relaxing afternoon #@Affiliation# #@Name#
Nice to meet you, I'm #@Affiliation# #@Name# How may I help you?
Yes, I have a few questions regarding your move-in report.
I am registered with my parents.
So what changes if I report my move?
Are you talking about the part where you report the move in your own name?
Are you living alone and moving in as the head of household?
But now I live in the company dormitory
Is it possible to have a house in someone else's name?
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if it's possible to report moving into the dormitory.
You may need to contact the dormitory manager directly.
Okay, so can I just bring my resident registration card to report my move?
If you visit in person, you must bring your ID.
We will check and inform you whether a stamp is required.
Could you please wait a moment?
Yes, thank you. I'll wait.
Yes, thank you for waiting, teacher.
If the head of household applies in person, an ID card and seal are required.
Because the address you visit may require you to bring different documents.
Please call the local community center you are reporting to and ask again.
Please visit us in person
Nice to meet you, I'm #@Affiliation# #@Name# How may I help you?
I would like to inquire about reporting my move.
Yes, how can I help you?
I'm trying to register my seal, but my original address is in Seoul.
I'm currently living in a company dormitory in the countryside.
But they said that seal registration can only be done at the actual place of residence.
I was wondering if I could change my address to the dormitory now.
I also want to know if I can register my seal here.
If you report your move to the local community center where you currently reside,
Seal registration is available in the area where the teacher is located.
Then, should I report my change of address to a place other than the one I'm currently living in?
Can I do it nearby?
If the area you are moving to is #@Address#
You must report your change of address at #@Affiliation#
You can also register your seal at a nearby address #@affiliation#
Okay, thank you for the guidance.
Nice to meet you, I'm #@Affiliation# #@Name# How may I help you?
Yes, I would like to reissue my nursing assistant certificate.
First, go to the #@affiliation# homepage and fill out the complaint form.
Download the reissue application form
Please write your address and phone number in the blank space on the application form.
And the documents you need to enclose are a copy of your ID.
There is one photo of the business card and there is a reissue fee and registration fee.
The reissue fee is 2,000 won and the registration fee is 2,500 won, so the total is 4,500 won.
You can exchange the money for cash by visiting the post office and sending it to us.
Where should I send this?
You can send it to #@affiliation# via the post office.
Then, go to the civil affairs office and fill out the application form.
They asked me to send it there with the cost enclosed.
Yes, sir, that's right. I will give you the address.
To the person in charge of #@Address# #@Affiliation#, Hongseong-gun, Chungcheongnam-do
The zip code is a total of five digits: #@number#
Yes, I understand. Thank you.
I appreciate it. Do you have any other questions?
Yes no no
I hope your work goes well #@Affiliation# #@Name#
Nice to meet you, I am #@Affiliation#Counselor #@Name#
I would like to reissue my certificate.
First, please contact #@affiliation# and ask.
Please visit us with the required documents.
I will guide you through the necessary documents. Can you please make a note of it?
Yes, please call me.
You will need a reissue application form and your ID.
You can download the application form by going to the #@affiliation# homepage and clicking on the civil complaint form.
My daughter lost this, so I'm applying for it. Do I have to come in person?
So is this a proxy application?
Yes, I will do it for you.
If you would like to apply instead, it would probably be better to apply by mail.
Can't I do it directly by proxy?
For proxy applications, it is recommended to contact #@affiliation# and then visit.
Let me first explain how to apply by mail.
Yes, then please do so.
Nice to meet you, I'm #@Affiliation# #@Name# How may I help you?
I'd like to inquire about reissuing my nursing assistant license.
Yes, sir, is this correct regarding reissue?
Yes, that's right, please help me
We can also provide guidance on required documents.
Is the first region to receive the grant Chungnam?
Yes, it's Yesan, Chungcheong Province.
I lost the original certificate, so I have a copy
Yes, teacher, I will guide you through the reissue documents.
You can apply in person or by mail.
What method of application would you like me to use?
Since I don't have the time to go, I think it would be better to register.
#@Affiliation# You can also process business by visiting the civil affairs office.
Then, #@affiliation# civil affairs office
Yes, that's right, teacher.
Hello, this is #@Affiliation# #@Name#
Yes, this is #@affiliation#. I have something to ask you.
The petitioner inquired about the regulations for permitting farm housing.
I asked the city/county office, but I didn't get an accurate answer.
I'm looking for a wiretapping officer. Who should I talk to?
Just a moment, I'll return your call. #@Phone# #@Affiliation#
I'll call you back now.
Yes, I understand. Thank you.
Yes, this was #@affiliation#, and if you need anything, please contact me again.
I have one more question. It's about the regulations for permits for farm houses.
I heard that you didn't get an accurate answer from the city/county office.
So you requested a connection to contact the wiretapping officer.
Okay, I'll connect you. You can call right away.
Nice to meet you, I'm #@Affiliation# #@Name# How may I help you?
Yes, I filed a complaint last time, and I wanted to check if it was received.
Yes, are you able to access the website now?
Yes, you can go to the #@affiliation# homepage.
Yes, if you look next to the letters #@Affiliation# Homepage#@Other#Net
There is a word called Minwon
Yes I see it now
If you hover your mouse over the word “Minwon”
Do you see the results of your civil complaint processing?
Yes I found it. What's next?
Yes, you can also check the phone reception history in the civil complaint processing result inquiry.
In case of electronic application, you can check the electronic civil petition processing status.
Then, if you submit the documents directly at the civil affairs office, they will be accepted.
Then does that go into the electronic civil petition?
I think you should ask the person in charge for the exact details.
I will connect you directly to the person in charge.
Is there a separate department in charge?
Yes, sir, there is a separate person in charge of receiving complaints.
Okay, then please connect me.
We will connect you to the person in charge of civil complaints at #@affiliation#
Yes, I understand. Thank you.
I'll connect you. You can call right away.
Nice to meet you, I am #@Affiliation# #@Name#
Hello, this is #@Affiliation#Counselor #@Name#
The petitioner has inquired about the establishment of a corporation.
Then I will guide you to the relevant person in charge.
First of all, in the case of international exchange, depending on the field, it is international tourism marketing.
Then, is the person in charge of cultural arts #@name#?
Yes, I am in the arts field.
But I can tell you something about culture and arts.
I'm not sure what kind of tendency is dominant
If that's the case, would you be in charge of the art department?
Yes, I am in charge.
If the ratio is the same for both, do you have to do each part?
Ultimately, we will have to decide which one is more suitable.
Then, we will convey the culture, arts, and tourism to the complainant in a different section.
And I will ask you one more time and give you final guidance.
Okay, I understand. Thank you for your hard work.
Yes, thank you for your answer.
Yes, it's #@Affiliation# #@Name#
Hello, this is #@Affiliation# #@Name#
I'm calling you because I have something to ask you.
Yes, please tell me what it is
The petitioner intends to establish a non-profit corporation with a focus on cultural tourism and international exchange.
Can you tell me who is in charge?
There is no special person in charge.
First, you need to know what the complainant's main purpose is.
We can't tell just by looking at the title.
So we need to check if we are #@affiliated#
But this is the first time I've heard of this case.
Since you said it was tourism, I contacted #@affiliation#
Okay, so you brought the documents?
No, you requested to be connected to the department to inquire.
I think you should come to our #@affiliation# for a consultation.
We need to know our main purpose
Oh, is this something that is difficult to discuss over the phone?
Yes, that's right. I can't help it.
First of all, I think you should come to our #@affiliation#
I think I need to hear more about this non-profit organization.
Yes, that's what we should do.
It depends on whether the purpose is international exchange or tourism.
This is all about culture, tourism, and international exchange.
Okay, I understand. I will guide you.
Nice to meet you, I'm #@Affiliation# #@Name# How may I help you?
Yes, thank you for your hard work. I am planning to create a non-profit organization.
I know that in the past, it was possible for the city to create a corporation.
I heard that now it is not the city but the province that is in charge.
Yes, teacher, what do you need?
For example, there are things like how many members you need to secure and things like that.
I want to know about the paperwork, administrative processing period, and what documents are required.
I think I can receive the documents by email in advance and prepare them right away.
And now the district office has a licensing issue, so we need a loan too.
Are you asking about the documents and procedures required to establish your corporate corporation?
Yes, later if necessary
I also want to know about the procedural issues regarding this part.
Yes, I understand, teacher.
I will check with the department in charge and call you back.
Yes, sir, did you get my number?
Yes, I will call you back at the number you provided.
Excuse me, what is your name?
Yes, my name is #@name#
Okay, I'll call you back. Do you have any other questions?
No, nothing else
Yes, I understand. I hope your work goes well.
It was #@Affiliation# #@Name#
Nice to meet you, I'm #@Affiliation# #@Name# How may I help you?
Yes, I moved from Seoul to Chungnam.
Is it linked to the childcare welfare card I used?
Or should I get a new one issued?
Teacher, what area did you move to?
That's the side where the wiretapping is
Are you in the #@address# area?
Yeah, I think so
Yes, I will check and let you know.
Could you please wait a moment?
Yes, please take your time.
Yes, thank you for waiting, teacher.
Have you moved to the #@Address# area and completed the move-in report?
No, I haven't reported my move yet.
Yes, then please report your move first.
After that, please call the local office.
You can visit and apply for the card.
If you want to issue a #@affiliation# Dasarang Card
You can apply through the call center and then visit us.
Does that have another purpose?
Do you have any questions about the use of the Dasarang Card?
Yes, I thought they were all similar
I will check the website and give you guidance.
Could you please wait a moment?
If it's on the website, I'll check it out.
Yes, I understand. Do you have any other questions?
No, thank you
Yes, take care of your health in this hot weather #@Affiliation# #@Name#
Nice to meet you, I am #@Affiliation# #@Name#
Yes, I live at #@address# and I would like to inquire about solar energy.
Yes, is this related to solar power construction?
Yes, that's right. I'll look into it.
Sorry, but there is a delay in connecting with the person in charge of solar power construction permits in Cheonan area.
Yeah, that won't work
Regarding solar installations under 500 kilowatts
I am also in charge of work at #@Affiliation#
#@Affiliation# It might be a good idea to contact them. Have you tried contacting them?
Cheonan City has already asked
Yes, you did ask
Yes, I want to know about absolute farmland.
I'm curious about what plans the departments related to agricultural land permits have.
Then I will connect to #@affiliation# and check.
Okay, I understand. Then please.
Yes, thank you for waiting.
I checked with #@affiliation# and it is difficult to confirm the name of absolute farmland.
We also heard that it is difficult to install solar power in agricultural promotion zones.
Okay, I see. I'll contact you again later.
Do you have any other questions?
No, there isn't, thank you
I hope your work goes smoothly. #@Affiliation# #@Name#
Nice to meet you, I'm #@Affiliation# #@Name# How may I help you?
Yes, I live in Cheonan.
I recently saw a news report saying that they are loosening regulations for solar power installation.
I wanted to ask if there are any such plans in Chungcheongnam-do.
Is it true that solar power installation regulations have been lifted?
Yes, originally, the agricultural promotion zone was only for farming.
I know it has something to do with farming or livestock.
The government is trying to encourage solar power installation.
I heard there are plans to release farmland.
So I was wondering if there was any information or plans related to Chungnam Province.
After checking the work details, I will connect you with the person in charge.
Could you please wait a moment?
Yes, I understand. Thank you.
Thank you #@Affiliation# #@Name#
Hello, this is #@Affiliation# #@Name#
Hello, what's going on?
Yes, hello, it's nothing else
The petitioner has made an inquiry regarding an application for extension of boiler appointment deadline.
There is an application for extension of the deadline for appointment of a regulator for the boiler inspection target device.
Please submit the application to #@affiliation#
You said you wanted to download it
It is difficult to confirm in our wiretapping civil complaint office form.
Can you tell me which department I can download from?
It doesn't work in the wiretapping department. You have to download it from the Legislation Department.
Yes, I told the complainant about that part, but he kept asking about wiretapping.
Could you please answer?
Okay, I understand. Please connect me.
Yes, you can call me right away.
Nice to meet you, I'm #@Affiliation# #@Name# How may I help you?
Yes, hello. My mother has a nursing assistant certificate.
I'm trying to move to another place, so I need to get my license again.
I would like to ask how to get it reissued.
Are you sure you took the qualification exam at #@affiliation#?
Yes, you took the qualification exam there.
Teacher, is it true that you took the exam at #@affiliation#?
I think your region is incorrect
My house is in Cheonan, but I heard you took the test in Cheongju.
I'll check it out. Could you please wait a moment?
Yes, I will wait.
Thank you for waiting
Could you please confirm the institution from which you received the certificate?
It was issued in 2013.
Yes, sir, you can apply for reissue from the institution where it was first issued.
I received it from #@affiliation#
#@Affiliation# Is your region Cheonan?
No, it's Seoul City #@affiliation#
If so, please contact #@Affiliation# #@Phone#
Yes, I understand. Thank you.
Nice to meet you, I'm #@Affiliation# #@Name# How may I help you?
Yes, hello, I lost my nursing assistant license.
I want to apply for reissue, what should I do?
Is the region where you first received the certificate in South Chungcheong Province?
Yes, that's right, I got it there.
Yes, there are two options: in-person and mail-in. Which is more convenient?
It would be better if you could send it by mail.
Yes, I will tell you how to receive mail. Can you send me a note?
Yes I'm ready, please let me know
First, I will guide you through the required documents.
#@Affiliation# You need to issue a reissue application form on the website.
If you have difficulty using a PC, you can also do so at your local city/county office.
After you submit your application, you can receive a copy by fax.
If you need the original, you can receive it by registered mail.
But the place I was trained at said they would help me through the internet.
Then, we will guide you directly through mail reception.
#@Affiliation# First, access the civil complaint form on the homepage.
If you search for a nursing assistant, you can download the reissue application form.
You also need to prepare a copy of your ID and a photo of your business card.
Please enclose the issuance fee of 2,000 won and the registration fee of 2,500 won.
Could you please resend the text you mentioned?
Yes, you can send text
Can I send it to the number you provided?
Yes, please send it to the number you are calling from now on.
Do you agree to the use of your personal information when sending text messages?
Yes, I will do it with your consent.
A text message will be sent after your call.
I hope your work goes smoothly.
Hello, this is #@Affiliation# Call Center #@Name# How may I help you?
Yes, I lost my nursing assistant certificate.
I want to get a reissue, what should I do?
Is this the part you first received from #@affiliation#?
Yes, that's right, I got it there.
Yes, sir, if you visit the wiretapping office, it can be processed immediately.
If you have difficulty, you can apply by mail or at your local city/county office.
How can I guide you?
Please guide me on how to process it by mail.
I will give you the documents required for the postal method. Can you send me a note?
Yes, please tell me
First, you must fill out a reissue application form.
You can download the application form from the #@affiliation# homepage.
You must also prepare a photo of your business card.
The issuance fee is two thousand won, the registration fee is two thousand and fifty won, and the total is four thousand and fifty won.
Please exchange the money for standard currency at the post office before using it.
Finally, please send it along with the cost and application form.
So how does it work in the postal city/county/district?
If you submit the above documents to your local city/county office, they will be received by the provincial government.
After that, I will send it to you by registered mail from the wiretapping office.
So, do I go directly to the city hall to apply?
I think it would be better to submit it directly via mail.
I guess mail would be faster.
I will give you your address and zip code.
Chungnam Hongseong-gun #@Address# #@Affiliation# To the person in charge of qualifications
Yes, I understand. Thank you for your help.
I will give you the zip code #@number#
Yes, thank you #@Affiliation# #@Name#
Hello, this is #@Affiliation# #@Name#
Excuse me, sir, but I am contacting you because I have a question.
Yes, what is your inquiry?
Mr. Minwon is a male born in the 90s who has not served in the military.
There are two overseas business trips, one in the third week of August and the other in the last week.
A male born in his 90s who has not completed his military service will be on overseas business trips twice, in the third and last week.
Only one-year, single-entry passports are allowed.
I understand that multiple passports are impossible.
Is it true that the passports are issued twice in total, each for a separate issue?
First, you need to check the date you receive your overseas travel permit.
This is something that we issue based on your application to the Military Manpower Administration.
So that part is not up to us to decide.
In our country, people are required to serve in the military until they turn 37.
Even if you are 90 years old, if you are given a permit date
We only give it as of the permit date.
So what if I get permission to travel in the week of August?
Can I use it twice with a one-year single-entry passport?
No, you have to issue it in multiples.
Okay, I understand. Thanks for the answer.
Hello, this is #@Affiliation# Call Center #@Name# How may I help you?
Hello, I have something to ask you.
Hello, teacher. How may I help you?
I'd like to ask about the voucher card.
Yes, which voucher card are you talking about?
Women's Rural Voucher Card
Do you have the Women Farmers Happiness Maucher Card?
Yes, that's right. Has the card been issued?
Please wait a moment. I will check with the relevant department and get back to you.
Teacher, you can apply for the voucher card at your local township or district office.
What town or district do you live in?
#@Address# This is Hongseong-gun #@Address# This is
If so, please contact the Hongbuk-myeon office.
Yes, you can ask by phone first.
Yes, you can, sir.
Yes, thank you for your hard work.
Nice to meet you, this is #@Affiliation# Call Center #@Name#
Teacher, how may I help you?
Yes, hello, I would like to inquire about my passport.
My passport expires in August.
Can I reapply?
Teacher, if your pass expires in August, you will need to reissue it to use it.
Then, the reissue period is one month in advance.
Is there no such period?
Yes, that's right. You can apply right away.
Is it okay to just do it at any time?
#@Other# but I think there is still time left
Your passport must have at least six months remaining
I think it would be a good idea to apply now due to the limited time available.
Okay, can I just go to the city hall and apply?
You can apply at a nearby city hall.
Please make sure to bring your previous passport when applying.
Is there anything else I need to prepare separately?
You only need to bring your current passport.
Hello, this is #@Affiliation# Call Center #@Name# How may I help you?
Hello, I would like to inquire about an emergency passport.
I have a travel date set in a hurry
Is there any way to get my passport issued quickly?
Is your purpose simply travel?
Yes, because the trip was arranged in a hurry.
If you are simply traveling, you can do so as long as there are no issues with your identity verification.
However, when issued by the wiretapping office, weekends and public holidays are excluded.
It takes three to four days on weekdays.
I contacted #@affiliation# and was told that same-day issuance is not possible at the wiretapping office.
Yes, that's right, teacher.
Then, what kind of reason would be required to make it possible on the same day?
Emergency passports can only be issued in the event of the death of a parent or for an urgent business trip.
Teacher, since your purpose is to travel, it is difficult to get a passport on the same day.
So the fastest way would be about three days?
Yes sir it will take three or four days
So if it is made at the city hall, will it be issued within the city hall?
If issued by #@affiliation#, it will be delivered to #@affiliation# and manufactured.
Therefore, even if you apply from #@affiliation#, the required period is similar.
Hello, this is #@Affiliation# Call Center #@Name# How may I help you?
Hello, I want to cancel my complaint, but I don't know how.
Is it possible to cancel over the phone or do I have to do it online?
Is this the part where you visited the city hall and filed a complaint?
Yes, that's right, I did that.
Then I will connect you to the person in charge of the civil affairs office.
Yes, I would appreciate it if you could do that.
Do you need anything else?
No, there is nothing more, thank you for your help
Yes, I hope your work goes well. Thank you.
Hello, this is #@Affiliation# #@Name#. How may I help you?
Yes, I'm planning to ask my relative to issue me a certificate of relationship.
For this job, simple agency is difficult.
So you're saying I need to write a power of attorney?
Yes, for detailed documents, please contact the district office or community center you are visiting.
It would be more accurate to check with your area.
I'm in Seosan. Is there a #@address# local office?
I'm sorry, teacher. Could you please tell me the address again?
This is #@Address# in Seosan-si, Chungcheongnam-do
Is this Seosan City #@Address#? I'm sorry. I will check and inform you.
I checked and it was difficult to confirm the number of the center.
I will connect you to the representative number of #@affiliation#
No, then there is no #@address# resident center either?
I will check the number again and let you know. Could you please wait a moment?
Yes, I'm really sorry for keeping you waiting for so long.
#@Address# We will confirm the administrative welfare center number and provide you with guidance.
Please give me your number.
Yes, it's #@phone number#. Did you take note of it?
Yes, I wrote it down well. Thank you.
Yes, thank you very much. Do you have any other questions?
No, thank you for your kind advice
Yes, thank you. I hope your work goes well. #@Affiliation# Call Center #@Name#
Hello, this is #@Affiliation# Call Center #@Name# How may I help you?
Can I get my family seal certificate?
Are you looking to receive a certificate of seal on behalf of your teacher's family?
Yes, since it's your province, I think you should receive it by proxy.
We will check the part you inquired about and give you guidance. Please wait a moment.
Thank you for waiting. I checked the part you asked about on the Internet.
When issuing a certificate of seal when the agent is 19 years of age or older
Please bring the seal reporter's ID, power of attorney, and agent's ID.
It has been confirmed that you can visit the nearest district office or community center.
So, a seal certificate, an ID card, and then a power of attorney.
Yes, and you can visit us by bringing your agent's ID.
Then, can't it be issued online? Or by electronic issuance machine?
Are you inquiring about receiving a certificate of seal on behalf of a PC?
It has been confirmed that it is difficult to issue a teacher's seal certificate through a PC.
Then, there is an electronic issuance machine, so that doesn't work either.
Teacher, are you asking about the unmanned issuance machine?
Yes, the unmanned issuance machine is not allowed there.
I'm sorry, teacher, but it seems that it is difficult to issue unmanned issuance machines.
Nice to meet you, this is #@Affiliation#. How may I help you?
I'm calling to inquire about the hospital's closure.
If you have any questions regarding hospital closures, please contact your local city or county office.
Of course I know, there must be a department in charge of the hospital over there.
The person in charge of wiretapping who can provide consultation is correct.
Excuse me, but what type of hospital is the one you mentioned?
It is a general hospital located in Taean, South Chungcheong Province.
Okay, I'll check with the medical institution and then connect you.
The medical institution management manager is confirmed in the Low Birth Rate and Aging Society Countermeasures Division.
I'll connect you right away
Yes, but it takes a long time to connect
The person in charge is not at his desk right now because he is in a meeting.
I was told that I could call after 1pm.
Yes, after one o'clock. Okay.
Yes, I checked with the relevant department, and they said the person in charge was transferred to another department.
I will guide you through the department phone numbers for the section where the new person in charge is located.
Okay, then please do that.
I will forward a note to you so that you can contact me as soon as the meeting is over.
It's a refreshing morning. #@Affiliation# #@Name# How may I help you?
I filed an administrative appeal
I want to change that psychological date.
Yes, sir, do you want to change the date of the administrative appeal hearing?
Yes, that's right. I thought it would be difficult on the original application date.
According to the Administrative Appeals Act, a party may request a change in the hearing date.
When a teacher applies, the committee will consider the reason for the change and decide whether or not to make the change.
Then it doesn't mean that they will change it unconditionally.
Yes, but you can change it if you have a good reason.
Okay, I understand. I'll try applying.
Yes, so far it was #@Affiliation# #@Name#
It's a refreshing morning. #@Affiliation# #@Name# How may I help you?
I filed an administrative appeal a while ago.
That was decided a few days ago.
But what procedure should I take if I want to appeal the decision?
Yes, sir, do you wish to appeal the administrative appeal decision?
Yes, that's right. Please tell me how to appeal the decision.
According to the Administrative Litigation Act, an administrative lawsuit may be filed against the defendant with the administrative court having jurisdiction over the defendant's location within ninety days from the date of receipt of the decision.
This guide is based on cancellation lawsuits.
Yes, you can file an administrative lawsuit within ninety days.
Yes, that's right. Do you have any further questions?
No, it's all resolved, thank you
Yes, I am more grateful #@Affiliation# #@Name#
It's a refreshing morning. #@Affiliation# #@Name# How may I help you?
Yes, I have a question about administrative adjudication.
Yes, sir, what kind of inquiry do you have about administrative adjudication?
I filed an administrative appeal a while ago.
I'm curious about what the process is like after that.
First, the Administrative Appeals Commission receives a response from the defendant.
At this time, the claimant will also receive a response and may raise objections to the response.
Afterwards, a decision is made by comprehensively examining the facts claimed by the parties and related laws and regulations.
So, that means they will hear the claims of the claimant and the defendant and then decide.
Yes, that's right. Do you have any further questions?
No, this is enough
Yes, thank you #@Affiliation# #@Name#
Good morning, this is #@Affiliation# #@Name# How may I help you?
I need to have my case tried by #@affiliation#
Do I have to attend?
Sir, what judgement are you involved in?
I asked a question about whether I should attend the administrative hearing.
Teacher, the administrative hearing is conducted through oral or written hearing in accordance with Article 40 of the Administrative Appeals Act.
If you do not request an oral hearing, the hearing will be conducted in writing.
I applied for oral examination, but can I move on to written examination?
In such cases, if it is recognized that a decision can be made through written examination alone, it can be conducted in writing.
I see, thank you for the information.
Yes, I hope your work goes smoothly. #@Affiliation#

Yes, teacher, is your overseas travel purpose?
No, it's a matter of parents sending their children overseas.
By the way, when is your period of stay abroad and your departure date?
I think I'll be working overseas for about three years and I'll be leaving at the end of the year.
My child's international school has its first semester in September, so there is a gap.
Yes, because it is a case of studying abroad with a government-approved certificate
There is no subject-by-subject credit evaluation.
So how is the allocation done?
First, add up the period of study at a foreign school, both domestically and internationally.
Grades are assigned according to our country's twelve-year school system.
So what if there's a gap of about six months?
I would like to inform you about re-enrollment or transfer to a domestic elementary school.
If it is judged to be insufficient due to differences in academic systems between the countries concerned
It may be permitted at the discretion of the school principal.
That's a relief, thank you

Yes, I am disclosing the information on the same bulletin board.
Okay, #@affiliation# What is the homepage address?
Yes, it's #@URL#. You can also search for #@affiliation# on the search portal.
Yes, I will go in and check. Thank you.
Thank you and have a wonderful day, counselor #@name#
This is #@affiliation# with citizens. How can we help you?
I would like to ask about college student mentoring. Can I ask here?
Do you have any questions regarding college student mentoring?
I'm planning to apply for college student mentoring this time.
You are currently a college student and are participating as a mentor.
Yes, that's right. I saw the notice at school, but it didn't say how to apply.
I'm sorry that the notice was somewhat lacking.
You can currently apply online. Can you tell me how?
Yes, it is possible now. Can you tell me?
Yes, you can access the Ulsan After-School Support Center website.
The address is #@URL#. Did you connect by any chance?
Yes, can I click on college student mentoring here?
If you go to the college student mentoring program, there is a mentoring information room.
You can check the contents there and apply.
It was easy to apply. I should have tried it and contacted you.
No, I don't think I could have explained it in more detail. Thank you.
Do you have any other questions?
No, I have no other questions.
Yes, I hope it helps a lot #@Affiliation#
This is #@affiliation# with citizens. How can we help you?
Yes, I heard that there is a career program called #@Other#
Can students or parents apply for it individually?
I'm sorry, teacher, but it is difficult to apply for the #@Other# program individually.
Then, can we gather people and apply as a group?
No, it is not that difficult and you can only apply by school.
There was no separate statement at school, so does that mean I can't do it?
We did convey the relevant information to each school.
Each school has different operating policies, so it may not have been announced yet.
Then you can't apply to the school through #@affiliation#
Yes, that's a little difficult. There will be a career guidance counselor at your school.
I think it would be best to ask him directly.
It's a career guidance teacher. If you ask your homeroom teacher about that name, you'll know.
Yes, that is the name commonly used for #@affiliation# affiliated organizations.
Okay, then I'll ask the school. Thank you.
I'm sorry I couldn't give you a satisfactory answer. Do you have any other questions?
No, I have no other questions. Thank you.
This is #@affiliation# with citizens. How can we help you?
Yes, I run a workshop at #@address#
This time, I would like to provide career experience activities to students.
Is there a separate application process? If so, please let me know.
Teacher, first of all, is your workshop registered as a business?
Yes, it is a workshop that is registered and operating normally.
Then, shall I give you instructions on how to apply right now?
Yes, you can apply from your computer too.
Yes, please access the #@affiliation# site and connect to #@URL#
Yes, I'm on the website now. What should I do from here?
If you look at the top, there is an experience registration page. Click on program registration there.
Yes, I have registered for the program. Should I enter the information here?
Yes, once your registration is complete, the relevant career experience support center will confirm it.
Then, apply for the program at school.
Once your application is approved, you can proceed with the career experience activity.
If I apply at school, will I get approval?
No, it will be approved by the relevant career experience center or career experience support center.
Please take your time browsing the site and do you have any other questions?
No, there isn't. The procedure isn't that complicated. Thank you.
I hope you found my site helpful #@Affiliation#
Hello, this is #@affiliation# with citizens. How can I help you?
Hello, I'm planning to use #@affiliation# with my friends this time.
Do I need to make a separate reservation to use the karaoke room?
Hello, are you planning to use it with your friends? When will you use it?
I'm planning to go this weekend, but I think I'll probably go on Saturday.
Yes, we are closed on Sundays, so if you want to go on the weekend, you have to go on Saturday.
If so, what time do you operate from?
Yes, first of all, you can register for the karaoke room on site and use it.
Because it is the weekend, there may be a waiting time due to the large number of users.
And our operating hours are from 10am to 5:30pm.
Okay, then can I stay in the comic book store below while I wait?
Perhaps they will give guidance when it is the student's turn on the spot.
Something like a phone notification or #@affiliation# message
So, I think you can just check your phone and use the comic book store.
Can I just go to the comic book store and apply?
Yes, it is on-site registration and the operating hours are the same, so you can use it conveniently.
Okay, thank you. I'll have fun.
Have a good time with your friends #@Affiliation#
Hello, I am #@Affiliation# Counselor #@Name#. How may I help you?
Yes, hello, I have a question.
Yes, what is your inquiry? Please explain in detail.
I would like to ask about the current construction project award at #@Affiliation#
Do you have any system in place?
Yes, there is a bylaw regarding the prevention of defective construction work.
We operate a reporting reward system in accordance with the ordinance.
How much is the reward if you report it?
As of 221, the reporting reward is 2 million won.
Two million won. Okay, thank you.
Yes, sir, do you have any other questions?
No, there is nothing else. Can I report it by phone?
If your phone call is not sufficient, you will need to visit the institution.
Okay, I'll think about it and call you back.
Yes, please call me later to ask for my cooperation. #@Name#
Hello, this is counselor #@Affiliation#, #@Name#. How may I help you?
Hello, we are holding a school management committee meeting this time.
Yes, are you a school faculty member?
Yes, that's right, but this is my first time being in charge of a committee.
Anyway, this time we need to elect the school management committee chairman and vice chairman.
I'm curious about whether or not the faculty members have voting rights.
Yes, I have a question about voting rights for the school management committee and the faculty committee.
I will check the relevant information and let you know. Please wait a moment.
Yes, he asked if the faculty committee also had voting rights.
Yes, teacher, I have checked Article 50, Section 6 of the Enforcement Decree of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.
It is said that faculty members also have voting rights.
However, they cannot be directly elected as chairman or vice chairman.
It is stipulated that members other than faculty members be elected by anonymous vote.
Teachers' committee members can also vote, but they cannot be directly elected.
Yes, I think you can understand it that way. Do you have any other questions?
Okay, thanks for the answer. I have no other questions.
Yes, thank you. Have a nice day. This was counselor #@name#
Hello, this is counselor #@Affiliation#, #@Name#. How may I help you?
Hello, I recently saw something called our education program on the apartment bulletin board.
Yes, teacher #@guitar# Is the curriculum correct?
Yes, it's called Nuriyo Kindergarten Curriculum. What is that?
Yes, the #@Other# curriculum is for children aged three to five.
Its significance lies in helping to promote healthy and harmonious development.
Ultimately, the goal is to form a foundation for democratic citizenship.
Then are you talking about some kind of mental education?
No, that's not it. Please understand it as a standard curriculum.
Then, it is education for children in daycare centers or kindergartens.
Yes, it is a common curriculum that integrates the kindergarten curriculum and the standard childcare curriculum for daycare centers.
Okay, is this the first time this is being done this year?
No, the five-year course was implemented starting in March 2012.
The course of the three thousand and four thousand years was implemented from March 2013.
Thank you for your advice. I'll have to check to see if my child is receiving it too.
Yes, I think you all have it in common. Do you have any other questions?
No, nothing else. Thanks for the answer. Have a nice day.
Yes, I hope you have a happy day too, teacher. Thank you.
Hello, this is counselor #@Affiliation#, #@Name#. How may I help you?
Yes, I am raising an elementary school child.
But I'm scared to send my child to school.
Yes, teacher, what part of your child's commute to school do you find difficult?
No, there is no designated school district in the neighborhood.
So every time I send my child to school, I'm afraid that something might happen.
Teacher, if that's the case, have you tried filing a complaint at the local community center?
I tried several times, but there was no improvement, so I called.
But is there a separate procedure for determining the school district?
Yes, your school district is based on Article 16 of the Enforcement Decree of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.
It is decided by considering the school organization and students' convenience in commuting.
Normally, you should notify the local town/village office by the end of November of the year in question.
Then, even if the decision has been made, it hasn't been notified yet.
Yes, I think you haven't even finished gathering opinions yet.
Then, you should provide guidance like that. The community center is also operating strangely.
I think this is where the confusion arose.
If you wait a little longer, you will see positive results.
Yes, thank you for your answer. I will wait a little longer.
Yes thank you counselor #@name#
Hello, this is #@Affiliation# Call Center #@Name# How may I help you?
Yes, I'm trying to apply for the childcare support program. Who are the application criteria?
Yes, first of all, I will tell you based on the date of January 1, 2021.
Children between the ages of three and five can receive support starting in March.
Are there any special conditions for receiving it?
No, all children enrolled in kindergarten are eligible, regardless of income level.
Thank you. Are there any other support items?
Yes, there is additional support for after-school program fees and tuition for low-income families or families with multiple children.
Who can receive after-school program fees?
Yes, this is for those who are eligible for after-school program support.
After-school programs require participation for at least eight hours, including daily instruction.
Okay, thanks for the answer. Thanks for your hard work.
Yes, do you need any guidance on additional support for childcare expenses?
Yes, I don't think that will apply to us. Thank you for your effort.
Thank you, I hope you have a great day #@Name#
Nice to meet you, this is #@affiliation#, the center of warm education. How can I help you?
Yes, I'm sorry for your hard work. I'm calling to tell you about my child's transfer issue.
Can I say it here?
Yes, please let us know what you want to ask.
My child is currently attending a specialized high school, but he wants to transfer to a regular high school.
Your child is attending a specialized high school. What grade is he in?
Yes, I'm a first year student now. I entered school this year.
Yes, if you meet the academic criteria, you can apply for a transfer.
If so, is the procedure simple or complicated?
No, you can apply after receiving a recommendation from the school principal.
If you don't mind, do you know what grade your child got?
As far as I know, this is the level. There are also limits to the level.
Yes, if you are within the third grade, it is possible.
First of all, since it is currently the first semester, I think you can apply until the end of August.
You can talk to the school and go through the principal's lottery process.
Okay, then you can talk to the school. Thank you.
Yes, I am more grateful. It was the center of warm education #@affiliation#
Hello, I am #@affiliation#, the citizen happiness partner. How can I help you?
Yes, this time my son returned to Korea after studying abroad.
So I need to go to high school, can you tell me the transfer process?
Your son came back to Korea this time and is planning to transfer to a high school.
Yes, I want to transfer to the general humanities department. What is the procedure?
Sorry, but #@affiliation# is not in charge of transfer students returning from overseas.
Although it may be inconvenient, you should contact the school you wish to transfer to directly.
Then, can we just make a request to the school we want?
Yes, if you request, the principal will decide whether it is possible or not according to the school regulations.
Then, does the principal decide which grade to assign the students to?
No, you need a certificate from a regular school located abroad to be assigned a grade.
Based on the certificate of affiliation and certificate of attendance, the assignment will be made in accordance with the Korean educational system.
Yes, I understand. Do you require proof of previous school years?
Yes, in addition to the certificate, you must also have a domestic final academic certificate.
For detailed inquiries regarding documents and procedures, please contact #@URL#
You can check it on the Education Yard bulletin board under Transfer students
Thank you for your reply. I'll have to check out the website too. Thanks for your hard work.
Thank you, Citizen Happiness Partner Counselor #@Name#
Hello, this is #@affiliation# call center, bringing you joy.
I am counselor #@name#. How may I help you?
Yes, I would like to ask for some advice regarding my child's transfer to another school. Can I talk to you?
Hey, what are you considering transferring for?
I don't think my child is adjusting to school life.
So, I was wondering if it was possible to transfer to another high school even if I was not adjusting to school life.
Yes, transfer is possible through the educational environment conversion transfer admission system.
Is that system available to all students?
No, this applies to students who need a change in educational environment for specific reasons.
So you're saying that maladjustment to school life is also a reason?
Yes, that's right. Is your child currently attending a regular high school?
Yes, I'm studying general humanities.
In that case, you need to get a recommendation from the school principal.
#@Affiliation# You must be reviewed by the Admissions Committee
Here, the superintendent assigns students who are judged suitable to other schools.
Then, I guess I should talk to your child's homeroom teacher first.
Yes, you can apply for the transfer admission system for educational environment conversion at your school.
Okay, thank you so much for your answer. Thanks for your hard work.
I am more grateful and have a happy day, counselor #@name#

We currently reside in Seoul at #@address#
My child is currently in the sixth grade.

You are taking your child to school from far away. It must be hard.

Yes, thank you for your hard work. I called to ask you something.
Yes, what is the reason you are contacting us?
My child is currently attending elementary school in Seoul.
I was wondering if we should install air purification facilities in the classroom.
Yes, that's right. These days, fine dust is a serious problem regardless of the season.
Yes, you should measure indoor air quality to see if you are in a hazardous environment.
We also expect it to be very bad
Shouldn't we be working to improve the classroom environment for children?
Yes, the Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education has currently prepared a comprehensive fine dust management plan.
Can you tell me what countermeasures there are?
Yes, first of all, we plan to operate a #@affiliation# support team comprised of professional personnel.
We also plan to sign a business agreement with an environmental expert organization and carry out a green movement.
You must be working hard. Take it easy.
Okay, I understand. My questions have been answered.

Hello, this is counselor #@Name# from #@Affiliation#.
Yes, hello. I'm contacting you because I have an inquiry.
Yes, what is the reason you are contacting us?
Should we install evacuation and fire fighting passages within our building site?
The question you are asking now is about a fire in the building you are using.

Yes, I heard that it is required by building code, so I was wondering if it is in place.
Yes, first of all, thank you for your interest and affection for our #@affiliation#
I will respond to your inquiry.
According to the Enforcement Decree of the Building Act, the main exit must be on the outside of the building.
A passage leading to the fire escape notice leading to the ground level must be installed.
Is this what the law says?
Yes, sir, this applies to all buildings according to the building code.
Yes, I understand. Thank you.

Yes, what are you curious about?
I'm thinking of opening an academy.
You are opening a school. What are you curious about?

Hello, I'm contacting you because I have something to ask you.
Yes, what are you curious about?
Could I possibly get my brother's high school transcript?
Are you talking about your younger sibling, not yourself?
Yes, my younger sibling needs to get his birth certificate issued urgently, but I don't have time.
In that case, there is a system where you can receive a certificate of proxy.
Ah, is it possible to issue it even if it's not me?
Yes, there are some documents you need to prepare for that.
Yes, please tell me. I will prepare it and come to you.
Yes, first of all, you need a power of attorney and two pieces of identification.
Here, the identification refers to the identification of the person giving the authorization and the person receiving the authorization.
Then I just need to prepare my ID and my brother's ID.
Yes, and also, the stamp of the person giving the authorization is required.

Hello, I am your friendly #@affiliation# counselor #@name#
Hello, I'm contacting you because I have something to ask you.
Yes, what are you curious about?
I have been working for over fourteen years.
Yes, you have been working there for a long time. What is the reason?
Yes, I am planning to use my long-term leave, but I am curious about the number of days I can use.
In your case, you are considered to have been employed for more than ten years but less than eighteen years.
The employees in question are entitled to fifteen days of vacation during their term of office.
Oh, then what if you worked for more than fourteen years?
Employees with more than twenty-five years of service are allowed twenty days of vacation during their term.
Yes, if I don't use it within the period, will the holiday be carried over to the next period?
Sorry, if you don't use your vacation time, it will be forfeited.

Hello, I'm contacting you because I have something to ask you.
Yes, what are you curious about?
Is there a way to make the part I want private?
Can you tell me how to make some of your information private?
Yes, or I am curious about the procedure for filing an objection if I am not satisfied with the disclosure
Yes, first I will tell you about the procedure for filing an objection to information disclosure.
An objection can be filed by filing an administrative lawsuit within seven days of the decision.
I have to sue
No, if you do not agree with the result of the administrative review, it will not apply.
Ah, this is no different from there being no way.
I apologize for the inconvenience. Currently, the principle under administrative law is to disclose information.
Oh, so that's not possible in principle.
Yes, currently it is only possible through a separate lawsuit.
I see, thanks for letting me know. That was very helpful.
I hope this answers your questions.

Yes, I have a question.
Yes, sir, please speak.
Yes, I lost my driver's license.

Hello, I am a counselor from #@Affiliation@ #@Name#
There are cases where a person who received permission to use national property dies.
I'm calling to inquire about the possibility of a blanket transfer of the license.
Yes, did the person who received permission to use national property pass away?
Yes, someone around me who had received permission to use national property passed away.
First of all, national property that has been granted a use permit cannot be used again for profit.
And succession of the license is also impossible.
Then is succession impossible?
Yes, there are cases where all the rights and obligations of the previous right holder are inherited in bulk.
Succession is possible exceptionally in cases that fall under the general succession under the Civil Act.
Is such a case possible as an exception?
There is a condition that it is within the remaining period of the person who originally received permission to use it.
Oh, I see. Thank you.
No no have a nice day #@name# was
Yes, thank you for letting me know.
Good morning #@Affiliation# Counselor #@Name#
Yes hello, is this #@affiliation#?
Yes, that's right, we are working together for your happy #@address# education.
Yes, can the Office of Education help establish a new elementary school in Maegyo?
#@Address# Thank you for your interest in education.
During that time, there was a lot of effort to establish a new elementary school at #@Address#.
We apologize for the delay in establishment due to re-examination.
Didn't it pass this time either?
Yes, sorry, there are a lot of construction vehicles crossing the 8-lane road for students.
Oh, that's right in that area. There was a huge street.
Yes, we are preparing for the school's re-review to ensure smooth placement.
Okay, I guess it'll be difficult to establish a new one this time too.
Yes, unfortunately it has been delayed a little more.
I hope this satisfactorily answers your question.
We will become a #@affiliation# that works even harder for the happy growth of students.
Hello, I am a counselor from #@Affiliation# Counseling Center #@Name#
We would like to inform you of the results of our review of the complaint you submitted.
You said you were filing a complaint. Where are you?
We are #@affiliation#. Aren't you customer #@name#?
Oh yes, that's right. It was so long ago that I couldn't remember.
We will inform you of the results of the review of the complaint you submitted through #@affiliation#
To summarize the complaint, it seems to be about old traps and downtown redevelopment.
People living at #@Address# are moving, so countermeasures are needed.
Yes, that's right. That's why we urgently need to come up with a solution.
This is something you guys also knew about.
Yes, the population has been decreasing for the past five years due to low birth rates and sluggish major industries.
It is said that in the long term, it can weaken growth potential.
So, I made a petition suggesting that we start construction of the tram early.
We are also working to promote the suggestions you have made.
However, in the case of trams, administrative and financial procedures must be followed.
Contrary to our #@address#'s intentions, citizens may feel it slowly.
Yeah, I see. Those are long-term problems.
Thanks to those who are interested, it seems like it will be a great help in preparing population measures.
Okay, then thank you for your hard work.
Yes, thank you. Take care of your health in this hot weather.
Hello, this is counselor #@Name# from #@Affiliation#.
Yes, hello. I'm calling to ask you something.
Yes, what is the reason you are calling?
I'm curious about the criteria for the composite material quality control certificate and the insulation material quality control certificate.
Are you talking about the quality control of composite materials and insulation?
Here are the criteria for judging the four quality control certificates.
First of all, the building materials subject to the quality control report for composite materials vary depending on their intended use.
You should decide whether to write it or not based on the type, location, and purpose of the material.
You should contact your local licensing authority regarding this matter.
Then you can't tell from this side?
Yes, you should contact the competent licensing authority for the construction materials for which a quality control certificate is prepared.
Okay, I understand. I'll ask them.
Yes, it was #@name# of #@affiliation#
Hello, this is counselor #@Affiliation#, #@Name#
Yes, hello. I'm calling because I have a question.
Yes, is there anything you would like to ask?
For lactose-free products, can it be labeled as easy to digest or easy to digest?
Yes, sir, is the product you are talking about a dairy product?
Yes, this is lactose-free milk for people who have trouble digesting lactose.
Is this a different product from the milks sold on the market?
Yes, this is milk for people who cannot drink commercially available milk.
In that case, it is possible to get some indications of comfort or good digestion.
Ah, is it possible to write it with that word in it?
Yes, it is possible to indicate the purpose you mentioned.
Yes, thank you. I asked because I don't know the #@affiliation# policies very well.
Yes, please contact us anytime with any further questions
Hello, I am a counselor from #@Affiliation# Counseling Center #@Name#
Yes, I have a question about the shelter facilities for abandoned dogs.
Yes, sir, are you talking about the shelter for abandoned dogs?
Yes, there is an animal shelter in my neighborhood, but the facilities are very outdated.
Excuse me, but could you please tell me your address?
Here is the address #@address#
Yes, thank you for confirming
Currently, one old facility is found at the confirmed address.
Yes, it's been a while since it was built, so it looks like it needs some improvement.
Yes, our current payment budget has increased significantly compared to last year.
We are continuously trying to bring about change by additionally allocating a budget for treatment.
Oh, it's a lot better than before.
Yes, it seems like your management is doing better than before.
Yes, I understand. Thank you for your guidance.
Thank you, counselor #@name#
Hello, this is #@affiliation# with the people.
Yes, I called because I wanted to ask you something.
Do you have any questions for us?
Yes, can I ask about the specifications of LED lamps that replace fluorescent lamps?
Yes, sir. I will check the details you have inquired about.
We have confirmed that you have inquired about the replacement LED lamp you mentioned.
Yes, that's right. Is there a replacement LED lamp for the current standard?
Must be suitable for six-point cuts, regardless of whether mechanical switches are attached
When I looked, I couldn't find any other lamps that would fit there.
Yes sir, currently this specification is the only model of the fluorescent lamp you mentioned.
Then, does that mean it can't be replaced with another product?
Yes, it can only be used with the corresponding lamp itself that is suitable for the six-point five-section.
Okay, I'll have to be careful when using it.
Yes, please contact us anytime if you have any further questions.
I will take good care of you. I am a counselor #@Affiliation# #@Name#
Hello, I was watching the broadcast and I had some inconvenience.
Yes, I heard you had some inconveniences.
There are subtitles at the bottom of the broadcast, right?
Are you talking about the broadcast subtitles?
I'm watching the broadcast with the subtitles on, but they're so loud that it feels like a distraction.
Are you uncomfortable watching the broadcast because the subtitles are too big?
We apologize for any inconvenience caused to you, customer.
#@Affiliation# There are a lot of malicious comments in the comments and it seems like the subscription fee is expensive
I would like you to come up with some countermeasures for that.

Hello, is special work allowance paid when on standby?
First of all, I understand that what you said is about special work allowances.
Yes, I am a local government employee. Will I be paid a special work allowance when I am on standby?
Are you talking about the allowance that comes with the standby order?
Yes, I heard that there is a special duty allowance.
The allowance is for general civil servants of Grade 6 or lower and special civil servants of Grade 6 or lower.
Because I am a civil servant who falls under that category.
Yes, if you do that, you will be paid a special work allowance when you are on standby.
Is that so? Then the allowance is paid by the number of days worked.
Your salary will be calculated based on the period of time you worked.
If you are not engaged in your job, you will not be eligible for special work allowance.

Hello, I am #@name# working in the #@affiliation# Educational Facility Safety Department.
#@Address# I hope that the supply of rebar for new elementary, middle, and high school construction will be guaranteed.
Yes, I see. First of all, thank you for your interest in our educational administration.
The recent surge in steel prices has led to a supply shortage.
So the construction of school facilities that required steel reinforcement was inevitably delayed.
Is the construction delayed due to a shortage of rebar?
Yes sir, we have a problem with the procurement office.
I see. So you're not getting any supply right now?
So when will we be able to get supplies back like before?
It's hard to predict given the current situation.
Is this a situation that is not easy to predict?
Yes, we are working to ensure that the school facility construction is delivered with priority.
We are doing our best to ensure smooth supply, including requesting cooperation from the Public Procurement Service.
We get a lot of complaints
Yes, hundreds of them are coming in every day.
You must be working hard. Take it easy.

Hello, I'm contacting you to ask you something.
Yes, hello. Please let me know if you have any questions.
I was wondering if it is appropriate to issue a warning to a vehicle that violates traffic laws.
Are you talking about the offending vehicle?
Yes, I am very uncomfortable because there are many vehicles that violate the law.
Are you very uncomfortable? Let me tell you what we can do for you.
Refers to police activities to warn and punish people who violate traffic laws.
So there's nothing that non-police people can do?
There are four possible cases:
Is that so? Could you please let me know?
Yes, first of all, it is for investigations into accidents and incidents.
Secondly, it is possible in unavoidable cases such as emergency rescue.
These are cases that are hard to see normally.
For those who violated the law, it is a case where more than one week has passed since the date of violation.
And finally, there are cases where it is judged that it impedes traffic flow.
It is also possible in cases of violations that are judged not to cause danger.
Okay, I was wondering if it was possible, thanks for the explanation.

If you display it on the main display, please write it in font size of twelve points or more.
If you display it as a product name
You must use a font size of 14 points or larger.

According to the enforcement regulations of the Waste Management Act
Car wash facilities are not specifically regulated in the facility and equipment standards.
So how do you use equipment other than transport vehicles?
Please be advised that most car wash facilities are rented.
Many people are working like that.

I was told that my driver's license was revoked for drunk driving.
What is the cancellation procedure?
Yes, I would like to inquire about the cancellation procedure for my driver's license.
Yes, that's right. Could you please guide me through the process?
License cancellation or suspension is not an immediate sanction.
First, if it is not a serious case at the drunk driving crackdown site, you will be sent home.
Yes, that's right. It doesn't work right away.
A notice to appear will be sent from the police station in charge of the place of detection within seven days from the time of detection.
At this time, the driver's license administrative disposition may be executed at the same time as appearing at the police station.
I think I've heard of a temporary driver's license. Can you tell me about it?
You can get a temporary driver's license that allows you to drive temporarily for 40 days.
Upon your appearance at the police station, your driver's license will be confiscated by the detective in charge.
Your license will be revoked or suspended prior to the situation.
There is a request for attendance at the prosecution office and a trial for a summary order to pay fines as stipulated in the Road Traffic Act.

The front passenger windshield of a car parked in the parking lot was damaged.
How to solve it
I understand that you are asking for the arrest of the criminal who damaged your vehicle.
What should I do to catch your criminal?
I need CCTV footage of the area where the vehicle was parked.
Once we have a suspect, we will need to search the surrounding areas to determine who he is.
Black box footage is also possible
Yes, video footage is possible
First of all, I need to find the video footage.
For reference, glass breakage cases on vehicles are clearly stated in the criminal law.
It is judged that Article 366 of the Act on the Destruction of Property has been violated.
Okay, I understand. Thank you.

I would like to inquire about the wearing of safety helmets by traffic control workers at the site #@Affiliation#
The Industrial Safety and Health Act strives to prevent industrial accidents among its employees.
To protect workers from risks related to their work.
For this purpose, protective gear is provided and required to be worn.
Yes, that's how it's regulated.
#@Affiliation# The employer who hired the agent is responsible for providing protective gear to the agent.
Is the obligation on the employer who hired you?
Yes, employers should check the working conditions of workers who operate traffic signals.
After that, first determine whether it is a dangerous task or not.
In case of danger, safety helmets must be provided to workers.
And you have to wear this.

I want to see the data on the fines paid
Data on penalties already paid will be kept for five years.
However, in the case of surveillance photos, they are only kept for one year.
I would like to see the crackdown photos
Only one sheet is confirmed before August 14th, 17th year
After that, you get nine cards for running red lights and one card for speeding.

I would like to inquire about the application for issuance of a criminal investigation history report and sexual crime history search.
A criminal investigation record report can only be issued if there is a legal basis for it.
It is different for general companies that are not based on law.
You may be subject to penalties if you request issuance or submit it in response to such request.
I guess I'll have to be careful about that.
First, I will tell you about the director of the organization's history of sexual crimes.
The head of the institution or the relevant ministry requests the police.
What about those who are planning to get a job?
The head of the organization where the prospective employee is seeking employment must make a request to the police.

Where do I report reckless driving or retaliatory driving?
If it's on-site, you can report it one by one.
#@Affiliation# There is a site that looks for smart citizen tip witnesses.
You can report by attaching evidence to each police station #@affiliation#
I guess I can report everything right away.
What department is in charge?
The department in charge is the police station #@affiliation# in the jurisdiction of the vehicle owner's address.
What happens if I report retaliatory driving and then withdraw it?
Depending on the type of crime applied, the progress may vary, so consult with the investigator in charge.
If a case is filed for simple assault and threats, it is considered a crime not punishable by imprisonment
If a case is filed for special intimidation, the case will proceed regardless of whether it is withdrawn.
That is why you need to consult with the investigator in charge.

Specialized high school students can apply if they meet the grade standards at the end of the first semester.

Is it possible to transfer to another high school due to maladjustment to school life?
There is a separate system for students who need to change their educational environment.
We are currently implementing a transfer admission system for educational environment conversion.
Is there such a system? What is the content?
I will give you some information about the lottery allocation for regular high school students.
This is when the school principal recognizes the need to change the educational environment.
We hold a transfer review committee for students recommended for transfer to another school.
The superintendent of education assigns students who have passed the eligibility screening to schools.
Should we hold a judging committee?
Yes, counseling and psychological treatment can be provided at your current school for more than three months.

Please tell me the procedure for a returning student to transfer to a high school.
You must inquire about transfer directly to the school you wish to transfer to.
Should I contact the school?
The transfer of students returning to high school is subject to the school regulations.
Accordingly, the school principal decides on grade assignment and whether transfer is possible.
It may be different for each school.
In regular schools, it is centered around grade transcripts and certificates of attendance.
Based on this, we calculate according to our country's education system.
There are cases where the educational system in foreign countries is different from our country's educational system.
In our country's education system, the standard is the number of years of education according to the curriculum for each school level.
Foreign school courses and grades are recognized based on those criteria.
Then I will contact the school again.

The National Police Agency sends out notices based on the registered address.
Therefore, there is no way for the police department to take action.

Please contact the local community center in your area.
There is a way to delete the address of the person who previously lived there.
Or, please contact your local community center for advice on how to change your address.

Hello, this is #@Affiliation# #@Name#
I want to know the documents to submit for the College Scholastic Ability Test
Yes, nice to meet you. I will answer your inquiry.
Can you take notes now?
Yes, I can give you a note. Please tell me.
Common submission documents include one application form and two passport photos.
A receipt for the examination fee and identification are required.
Is this all I need to prepare?
There are also other additional supporting documents.
Yes, please guide me on that too.
For other supporting documents, please refer to the #@affiliation# homepage. Thank you.
Thanks for the guide, it was helpful
Thank you#@Affiliation# #@Name#
Thank you for your kind guidance.
Nice to meet you, I'm #@Affiliation# #@Name# How may I help you?
Yes, please tell me how to get from Cheonan Terminal to #@Address#
I'm really sorry, teacher.
Please tell me again the name of the apartment you will be arriving at.
From Cheonan Terminal, #@Address#
Yes, is this #@address# at Cheonan Terminal?
I will inform you after confirmation.
Could you please wait a moment, sir?
Yes, thank you. I'll wait.
Yes, thank you for waiting.
#@Address# Directions have been confirmed
We will guide you on how to use public transportation.
Can you take notes now?
Yes, please call me for a moment.
Take bus number 90 from the bus stop located right in front of the express bus terminal.
If you go eleven stops, you can get off at #@Address# stop.
Yes, thank you for your explanation.
Nice to meet you, I'm #@Affiliation# #@Name# How may I help you?
They said they would fax me proof that I passed the nursing assistant qualification test at the wiretapping office.
Teacher, I will check the part you asked about.
Yes, I'm asking because I need it early.
The period of time required for the part you asked about has been confirmed to be approximately thirty days.
Yes, it takes about thirty days. That's too long.
Please connect me directly to the department. I will ask them directly.
I tried to connect with the person in charge, but it says the call is currently in progress
Then please give me your phone number.
I'll call you myself.
Your department number is #@phone#
Yes, #@my number is#. I understand. Thank you.
Nice to meet you, this is #@Affiliation#. How may I help you?
Can I receive a certificate of my nursing assistant exam by fax this time?
I will check the part you asked about and then inform you.
Could you please let me know if you would like to receive the fax first rather than the original?
Yes, that's right. I'd like to receive it by fax first.
Teacher, it is difficult for us to guide you on that part.
I think it would be a good idea to contact the person in charge of nursing care certification.
How should I do that?
Have you completed the application for the nursing assistant certification?
No, I confirmed that I passed the exam this time.
I think they will all visit the training center that completed the course and register in person.
If you receive the certificate as a group, it will be around the end of August or the beginning of September.
Yes, sir. I will connect you to the department in charge.
You can call right now
Okay, I understand. I'll try calling. Thank you.
Nice to meet you, I'm #@Affiliation# #@Name# How may I help you?
I would like to obtain a forestry engineering technician license.
Teacher, is this a reissue or a new application?
New application for forestry engineering technician qualification
How do I apply?
You can apply by mail or online.
I'm trying to receive mail
Yes, I will connect you with the relevant department.
Yes, please connect me. Thank you.
This is #@Affiliation# who you just spoke to. I will answer your questions.
First of all, you need a copy of your career certificate.
What should I do? I don't have a certificate of employment right now.
Please send your career certificate only if applicable.
One copy of the document proving completion of the prescribed course of study and one photo are required.
But I'm trying to get two engineering management technicians issued at the same time.
The documents are the same. The teacher just needs to list the technical qualifications differently.
So do I need two certificates or one?
If you are issuing in two forms, you must also fill out two application forms.
Okay, I guess I'll have to double each. Thank you.
#@Affiliation# I asked the teacher again.
You can download the certificate application form from the website and fill it out.
Where is the application form on the website?
If you look at the main page of the website, there is a civil complaint form.
You can check by logging in and searching for forest.
Then, what else do I need besides one copy of the confirmation letter, one ID photo, and two application forms?
A document proving completion of a prescribed training course is required from a forestry human resources development institution.
Yes, I understand.
And you just need to send us your ID photo and application form.
Where should I send the address?
Yes, I will give you the address.
Please send it to Chungnam #@Address# #@Affiliation#
Yes, I understand. Thank you for your guidance.
#@Affiliation# This is the teacher. I checked the information you asked.
A passport can be issued on behalf of a minor by a relative within the second degree of kinship.
There may be additional documentation required.
What is that? What additional documents?
I will check and let you know.
Is your child planning to visit?
Or are you planning to have a relative within the second degree issue the certificate on your behalf?
My daughter is going, but my aunt can go instead.
Then, first, I will guide you through the documents you need to prepare when you visit. Can you take notes?
Yes, you can make a note. Please call me.
If you have been issued a student ID or resident registration card, you must bring your resident registration card.
And you will need a passport photo and a consent form with the seal of your legal representative.
The consent form must be filled out by the legal representative and a certificate of seal is required.
When a student goes, this is what he needs
Yes, that's right, that's necessary
Okay, I understand. I'll have to get ready and go.
Nice to meet you, I'm #@Affiliation# #@Name# How may I help you?
I just asked you something about my passport.
They said I need two passport photos.
Is there a place to take passport photos inside the wiretapping office?
Yes, we have a passport photo machine installed.
Then can I just go?
I'm sorry, teacher. Could you please say that again?
This means that you can take the photo there without having to print it out in advance.
Yes, that's possible, sir.
Since the machine is a self-photography device, the work may be difficult due to regulations.
I think it would be better if you prepared a photo.
If that doesn't work out, then it's possible there too.
Yes, that is possible.
Nice to meet you, this is #@Affiliation#. How may I help you?
I was wondering if I could get a booklet about the adjustment criteria for the market price standard for other items in 2017.
We will inform you after checking with the department in charge.
I will contact the Tax Accounting Department to see if they can help you.
It was difficult to check if the booklet could be distributed directly, so I checked the #@affiliation# website.
We will provide you with downloadable information on the standard adjustment criteria for cigar prices.
#@Affiliation# Is this the correct homepage?
Yes, that's right. On the main page of the #@affiliation# homepage.
Do you see the first information disclosure in the top center?
Yes, I see the information is public
Yes, in the information disclosure, there is a standard market price for local taxes.
You can log in and refer to the section written in the previous month.
I was informed that there were changes in May, so please take note.
This is just the standard price for miscellaneous items, but I don't know if this is correct. Thank you for the information.
Yes, do you have any further questions?
Yes, thank you. I will contact you again if necessary.
Nice to meet you, I'm #@Affiliation# #@Name#. I'll talk next.
I will contact the investigation department and connect you.
Yes, please connect me to the investigation department.
Yes, I will first contact the investigation department and then give you guidance.
Yes, teacher, I am truly sorry for the inconvenience.
It has been confirmed that the person in charge is on the phone
I will call you after I check the part you asked about.
Yes, then please
When you prepare documents on behalf of a petitioner, do you have questions about the legal provisions?
I will call you after checking.
Do you have any further questions?
No, please contact me quickly.
Yes, I understand. I hope your work goes well.
Nice to meet you, this is #@Affiliation#. How may I help you?
Yes, hello, I have a question for you.
I'm calling to find out if there's any problem with #@affiliation#
Yes, teacher, please tell me.
Yes, I called the Ministry of Public Administration and Security, and they said that the documents are different for each local government.
I was told to contact the relevant department because the regulations may vary.
I don't know if the documents are different for each local government under #@affiliation#
For example, a civil servant acting on behalf of a petitioner named A.
I would like to ask the petitioner, Bira, if I can receive some documents.
Are there any regulations on that?
Oh yes, teacher, please continue speaking.
Yes, at the request of the petitioner, a non-petitioner's property damage occurs.
Any document that may infringe upon any private property
I would like to know about that now, if I can accept it.
Yes, I will check and let you know. Could you please wait a moment?
Yes, I will wait. Please check and let me know.
Yes, thank you for waiting, teacher.
For the part you are inquiring about, please contact the investigation department of the Wiretapping Audit Committee.
The district office just conducted an audit.
I just spoke with the wiretapping inspector yesterday.
I'm saying this because I can't do it now. Who should I talk to in the gratitude department?
Yes, I will check and guide you. Could you please wait a moment?
Yes, please hurry up
Nice to meet you, I am #@Affiliation# #@Name#. Please continue.
Yes, you just need to prepare one passport photo and some extra.
Yes, and you need a consent form with the legal representative's seal stamped on it.
A certificate of seal from the legal representative is required.
I need a consent form for the legal representative's seal.
If you are the legal representative, are you speaking to your parents?
I will check that part and let you know.
Could you please wait a moment?
I checked and it seems that it is something that should be done by parents.
Yes, then can I receive this consent form by fax?
Or is it necessary to have the original?
Is this something you receive from the district office?
You will receive it at the district office or the county office.
Ah, it's military service #@affiliation#
Oh, then I think it would be better to contact the issuing agency.
I think that would be more accurate, sir.
Okay, I understand. I will do it based on what you said.
Yes, you can just visit us with the documents I provided.
Nice to meet you, this is #@Affiliation#. How may I help you?
I'm a minor and I lost my passport.
I'm trying to get it reissued, but my address is now in Seoul.
Can I get it issued in another region even if my parents are not with me?
I will check the part you inquired about and then inform you.
I checked and confirmed that the address doesn't matter.
Are you a minor planning to visit in person?
Yes, I'm going alone
Oh, if that's the case, excuse me, but how old were you?
My name is #@Shinwon#
I will guide you through the required documents. Can you take notes?
Yes, you can take notes. Please tell me.
Yes, first of all, the application form is available at the civil affairs office window.
You can write it after your visit.
And if you are a minor, you can visit by bringing your student ID.
What other documents do I need, such as a student ID card?
And you will need one passport photo taken within the last six months.
However, if there is contamination or damage, it may be difficult to process the work.
If you prepare one more sheet as a spare, it will be helpful for processing the work.
Yes, I understand. Thank you.
Nice to meet you, I'm #@Affiliation# #@Name#. I'll talk next.
You can send it along with other documents and expenses.
Oh, I prepared everything here.
Yes, you can just send it along with all the documents.
I have to prepare it and send it to you.
Yes, that's right. We sent the address to you via text message.
Oh, I thought you meant that if I send money there, they'll give me the documents.
Yes, you can just send it along with the documents we provided.
Oh, yes, I understand. Thank you.
Do you have any further questions?
They said there was a civil complaint form there, but where can I find it?
#@Affiliation# Do you have internet access?
No, the internet doesn't work
Oh, is that so? Then, is it also difficult to use the fax machine?
I think you can ask for it by fax at #@affiliation#
If you know your fax number, we can fax the application to you.
Oh, yes, I understand. Thank you.
Nice to meet you, this is #@affiliation# How may I help you?
I called to reapply because I lost my certificate.
I received a text message and I need to prepare it and send it.
An application form and a copy of your ID and a business card photo are required.
Oh yeah, there are a lot of things
Teacher, have you filled out the application form?
Now I'm going to submit the application to the wiretapping office.
I went to the training center and brought the application form.
Then please fill out the application form.
One copy of your ID card and one photo of your business card. The issuance fee is 2,000 won.
Please prepare a total of 4,500 won, including 2,500 won for the registration fee.
You can change it to regular money order at the post office and send it along with other documents.
Oh, yes, I understand. Thank you.
Nice to meet you, I'm #@Affiliation# #@Name#. I'll talk next.
Okay, I understand. Please continue speaking.
Yes, I'm really sorry for keeping you waiting for so long.
I contacted the wiretapping department for low birth rate and aging population countermeasures.
Since it is a part paid according to the city/county ordinance, it is difficult for the provincial government to get involved.
I was told that I should contact the city/county office again.
Oh, then if the city or county office says it can't be done, then it can't be done.
Yeah, I think that's the part.
Yes, I understand. Thank you.
Do you have any other questions?
No, no further questions
Yes, I'm sorry I couldn't help you much #@Affiliation#
Please take care of your health in this hot weather.
Nice to meet you, I am #@Affiliation# #@Name#. Please continue.
#@Affiliation# I called the wiretapping office and they said there was no way to find out.
About the childbirth incentive you mentioned
I will check again and let you know. Could you please wait a moment?
Okay, I understand. I'll wait.
Thank you for waiting, teacher.
Oh, I'm sorry, but the childbirth incentive you mentioned first varies by local government.
It is difficult to confirm whether the city hall can give an accurate answer because the ordinances are different.
Are you having trouble receiving it in the area before you moved to that address?
Yeah, I called there too, and they said they changed their address.
Then, I have to move my address there again and live there for a year.
We moved, so we have to move again.
Doesn't this seem a bit ridiculous when you know when the baby will come?
#@Affiliation# We will connect you after confirming the number of the person in charge who can provide consultation.
Nice to meet you, this is #@Affiliation#. How may I help you?
Yes, I would like to ask about the childbirth incentive.
Excuse me, but which region are you inquiring about the childbirth incentive?
Yes, I'm from #@affiliation#, but they say I have to live there for more than six months.
My baby was due on July 17th, but she came out a little early.
It hasn't even been six months, so is there no other way?
The local community center said it was difficult
They said it had to be over six months
He just told me not to come out even a day early.
I won't tell you any other way
Nice to meet you, this is #@Affiliation#. How may I help you?
Would you like to inquire about childbirth incentives at #@affiliation#?
Okay, I understand. I'll try.
Nice to meet you, I'm #@Affiliation# #@Name#. I'll talk next.
I will try to connect you with the person in charge of the low birth rate and aging population policy.
I can go to #@affiliation# later and ask them to send it by fax.
Oh yes, then when you visit #@affiliation#, teacher
I will give you the contact number of the person in charge.
Oh, yes, I understand. That will work.
Can you take a note? It's #@phone number#
Just in case, please check if the person in charge is present before visiting.
I think it would be good to visit #@affiliation# later and handle business.
Oh, thank you. I will do that.
Any other questions?
No, thank you. Thank you for your hard work.
Yes, teacher, I hope your work goes smoothly.
Nice to meet you, I'm #@Affiliation# #@Name#. I'll talk next.
Is the department in charge also included in the text?
I think there should be a contact number.
No, I don't have a contact number.
I will check and inform you. Could you please wait a moment?
You can just send the application back to this fax number.
Yes, the person in charge will fax the application to you.
The teacher filled out the application form
Please bring all the required documents you received.
Please send it to the person in charge by registered mail and have the person in charge receive it.
I'm processing the work and sending the certificate back to you by registered mail.
But I called again because I didn't understand.
When I say documents, I mean the entire document.
Yes, that's right. The required documents are the required documents.
You can download the reissue application form from the original Civil Affairs Office Forms site.
But the teacher said that it was difficult to use the computer.
I think it would be a good idea to ask the person in charge to fax the application to you.
Yes, I understand. I will do that.
Nice to meet you, this is #@affiliation# How may I help you?
Hello, I'm the one who called you earlier.
I lost my certificate and am applying for a reissue.
They sent me the necessary documents by text message.
But where do I get these required documents and civil complaint forms?
All of the documents that we sent you via text message are documents that you must prepare.
Do you have any questions about how to download the reissue application form?
Yes, I would like to inquire about a reissue request.
Sorry, I'm not the counselor you called before.
Could you please tell me where I can download the reissue application form?
I got a text message
Where can I find the civil affairs office form for this document?
Is your PC available now?
No, I can't do that.
If you have difficulty using a PC, teacher
I think it would be a good idea to ask the person in charge to fax the application to you.
All you have to do is ask them to send you an application form.
Yes, sir, you can do that.
Nice to meet you, I'm #@Affiliation# #@Name#. I'll talk next.
I'm really sorry for keeping you waiting for so long.
No, please tell me
The person in charge will be out of the office for a moment so that he can contact the teacher directly.
I was told that a note would be passed on
Oh, so they're contacting you?
Yes, I will pass on a note to the person in charge so that he or she can contact you with your number.
Okay, I understand. Please do that.
Excuse me, but could you tell me your teacher's name?
Yes, my name is #@name#
Yes, I will forward the information to the relevant department. Do you have any other questions?
No, there isn't. Thank you for your hard work.
Yes, I hope your work goes smoothly. It was #@affiliation#
Nice to meet you. This is #@Affiliation#. I'm calling to ask you something.
Yes, please tell me your #@affiliation# #@name#
Hello, I'm sorry, but is Director #@Name# not in his/her seat?
Oh, you didn't come out today because you were on vacation.
I'm sorry, but the complainant called an ambulance.
I received the emergency medical records of the circumstances leading up to the call.
You asked if it was possible to request a correction because the information described was different from the facts.
Oh, by the way, is there a number I can call you back at?
The complainant is currently still waiting to be called.
Oh, right. The person who was supposed to answer is not here right now.
Oh, then I will tell the complainant about that part first.
I will contact you again and tell you the complainant's phone number.
Yes, that will work. Thank you.
Nice to meet you, I'm #@Affiliation# #@Name#. I'll talk next.
I'm really sorry, teacher.
It has been confirmed that the person in charge is currently someone else.
Oh, yes, is that so? Is this a difficult problem to confirm?
I will ask you again and connect you with the teacher.
Could you please wait a moment?
Yes, there are other things too, I'll check again and do it.
Teacher, I am truly sorry for the inconvenience.
We are currently checking with the person in charge.
Oh, okay, then what should I do?
I will contact you immediately after contacting the person in charge.
Yes, then please contact me like that
Nice to meet you, this is #@Affiliation#. How may I help you?
Yes, I wanted to ask you something.
I received an emergency activity record, but if the signature is different, can I request a correction?
Could you please tell me what kind of emergency activity record you received from the agency?
Yes, I received it from #@affiliation#
I received an ambulance log that recorded the circumstances leading up to the accident.
But the content is different from the other facts, so can a correction be requested?
I will check with the person in charge who can answer your question and then inform you.
Could you please wait a moment, sir?
#@Affiliation# We will contact the manager as soon as we confirm.
Yes, I understand. Thank you.
Hello, this is #@affiliation#. I have something to ask you.
Yes, hello, this is #@affiliation#
Yes, hello, Mr. Minwon, I am currently running a small business for an acquaintance.
I'm planning to build staff accommodations. Is there any support I can get from the local government?
#@Name# Mr. Injector is in charge
Oh, is that right? #@Name# Is that right?
Yes, #@affiliation# is not here right now, please call me in about thirty minutes.
Oh, yes, I understand. Thank you.
Yes, thank you for your hard work. If you have any questions, please contact me again.
Nice to meet you, this is #@affiliation# How may I help you?
I'm calling because I have something to ask you.
A friend of mine runs a small business and is currently building dormitories for his employees.
I was wondering if there was any subsidy or something from the local government.
Oh, is that so? Is this an inquiry about subsidies from the local government?
Yes, regarding the construction of staff quarters.
Oh, I will check and let you know. Could you please wait a moment?
Thank you for waiting, teacher.
Currently, I have confirmed with the person in charge of #@affiliation# and I will contact you and connect you to the teacher.
Could you please wait a moment?
Okay, I understand. Please connect me.
Nice to meet you, I am #@Affiliation# #@Name#. Please continue.
You have to pick up the application form at the district office.
It's not available at the town office.
Yes, it is available at the district office, sir.
Is it possible to get a seal certificate from a machine?
Yes, there is no separate form for the seal certificate.
You can just have your legal representative write it up.
You said you also need a certificate of seal stamp.
If an agent goes, can I get a certificate of seal issued by a machine?
Are you talking about the unmanned civil service issuance machine?
Yes, that's right, that's an unmanned issuance machine
It is difficult to issue a seal certificate at an unmanned civil service issuance machine.
Then I have to go to the community center.
You can get it issued at a nearby community center by bringing your ID.
Do you have any other questions?
Yes no no
Oh, yes, I understand. I hope your work goes well. #@Affiliation#
Nice to meet you, I'm #@Affiliation# #@Name#. I'll talk next.
A power of attorney written by a legal representative and a consent form with a seal are required.
And you also need a certificate of seal from your legal representative.
And the fee is ten thousand won for a single-use passport that can be used once a year.
Among the multiple passports that can be used without any restrictions for ten years,
If you are under 8 years old, 24 sides are 30,000 won and 48 sides are 33,000 won.
Yes, and for things like passports, you can go to the local office and make them.
Is this part made at the local office?
Yes, you can make it at your local community center as well as at your local government office.
Teacher, this is a part that can be issued by the city hall.
Then you have to go to the branch office
Teacher, where are you from?
Yes, this is the #@address#
Oh yes, is this #@address#? I will check with the issuing agency and let you know.
Could you please wait a moment?
Yes, yes, I understand
Yes, thank you for waiting, teacher.
If your address is #@, you can get it from your #@affiliated# district office.
#@Affiliation# It only works at the district office
Yes, and if you still have validity remaining on your existing passport, please make sure to bring it with you when you visit.
Yes, I understand. Thank you.
Nice to meet you, I'm #@Affiliation# #@Name#. I'll tell you more.
First, you need the legal representative's ID and the visitor's ID.
And the application form is available at the civil affairs office, so please visit and fill it out.
Yes, your agent ID and visitor ID.
We require one passport photo of your child taken within the last six months.
And it may be difficult to process work due to contamination or damage.
If you could prepare one more sheet as a spare, it would be helpful for processing the work.
Yes, a passport photo and some spare ones.
A power of attorney from a legal representative and a consent form with the legal representative's seal are required.
No, is it necessary even if the parents fill out and submit all the documents?
If a relative within the 4th degree of kinship visits, a power of attorney from a legal representative is required.
Do I still need the documents if someone else is just submitting them?
Yes, these are the documents I need, sir.
Okay, I understand. Thank you for your hard work.
Nice to meet you, this is #@Affiliation#. How may I help you?
Yes, I'd like to check out that passport.
Teacher, do you have any questions regarding your passport?
Yes, the baby will use that passport.
These are the documents my child needs to get a passport since my parents go to work during the week.
Teacher, are you inquiring about issuing a passport to a minor?
Your baby is four years old.
Teacher, your child is four years old now.
Yes, that's right, four years old.
Do you plan on having a parent visit you?
Yes, my maternal grandmother
Oh, is that so, maternal grandmother?
Mom and Dad don't have time during the week because of work.
Could you please wait a moment?
I will check the relevant documents and inform you.
Okay, I understand. I'll wait.
Yes, thank you for waiting, teacher.
I will guide you through the required documents. Can you take notes?
Yes, please tell me.
Nice to meet you, I'm #@Affiliation# #@Name# How may I help you?
I'm going to apply for a passport.
I have a seven-year-old child and I was wondering if I should take him with me.
If it is a passport of a minor child, it is not necessary to accompany them.
The legal guardian of the child can visit with the required documents.
Can I just bring copies of the required documents?
Excuse me, but could you tell me your child's date of birth?
Your date of birth is #@identity#
Yes, I will check and inform you. Could you please wait a moment?
Oh, yes, I understand. Please.
Thank you for waiting, but when issuing passports to minors under the age of six,
I will check the required documents and inform you. Can you take notes?
You can't send it by text
If you agree to the use of your personal information, you can send it. Do you agree?
Please send me your text
I will send you the required documents by text message to the number you provided.
Oh yes thank you
Do you have any other questions?
No, there is no more
Nice to meet you, I'm #@Affiliation# #@Name# How may I help you?
Nice to meet you, I'm #@Affiliation# #@Name#. I'll talk next.
Documents required to issue a passport appropriate for your child's age
I checked and called the number the teacher gave me.
I will contact you again and give you the information right away.
Oh again, yes I understand
Teacher, I'm sorry, but you said your name was #@Identity#
Could you please tell me your date of birth?
Ah, your date of birth is #@Sinwon#
Yes, I will check and call you back right away at the number you provided.
I'm working, so is it possible to send it via text?
You can also send it with four characters
When sending a text message, you must agree to the use of your personal information to send the text message.
Would you agree, sir?
Oh yeah it's okay
I will send you the required documents by text message.
Yes, I understand. Thank you.
Do you have any further questions?
No, it's okay. Take care.
Yes, please take care of your health in this hot weather #@Affiliation#
Nice to meet you, I'm #@Affiliation# #@Name# How may I help you?
I'm asking this because I'm getting my child a passport.
What documents are required?
We will guide you after checking the required documents for passport issuance.
Are you issuing a new one?
Or has your existing passport expired?
Yes, I have only a few months left for my passport.
Excuse me, but is your child an adult? How old is he?
Yes my child is #@Shinwon#
I will check and inform you. Could you please wait a moment?
Yes, thank you. I'll wait.
Thank you for waiting
Let me ask you one more thing
Excuse me, but what is your child's gender?
Oh, my child is a boy.
Oh, then you served in the military?
No, I haven't been in the military yet.
By the way, I'm going abroad at the end of August.
I asked when I got my physical and they said it was okay before 23 weeks.

I received a message that the old passport number was written in Korean and English.
Then it can be done in wiretapping
Yes, that's right. You must visit #@Affiliation#
Then, it's not something that can be done at the city hall.
Yes, that's right. It is possible to watch #@affiliated# in wiretapping or metropolitan city.

If you have difficulty visiting, you can visit #@affiliation# and send it by fax.
To the civil affairs office, no, but I went there last time.

Thank you for waiting. #@Affiliation# I will connect you to the person in charge right away.

This is where you can get it issued on the internet.
I had difficulty confirming the exact details using the certificate of deposit.
Could you tell me what documents are attached when submitting the registration change report?
Are these documents required when submitting a report on change of registration for a supervisory business?

Hello, this is #@Affiliation# #@Name#
Here, #@affiliation# is the person in charge of childcare leave.

Mr. #@Name# applied for childcare leave, but they said the application was not processed.
#@Name# Wait a minute, please wait a minute
Yes, I will wait.
Let me check the documents and our computer system for you.
Yes, I will wait.
I think there was something wrong with the salary data.
It's not the salary information for #@Name#, it's someone else's name that's showing up.
There are two seats, and the front seat contains personal information and the regular wages for the childcare leave period.
But it wasn't content that could distinguish each item in detail like a payslip.
On the next sheet there is a pay stub that says #@Name#. I think it's someone else's.
Then, can I just send you Mr. #@Name#'s salary information again?
Yes, I think you should do it by rejecting it and filing a new report.
Are you saying that I need to file a new report?
If you say thank you or something like that, there may be a problem if there is a mismatch.
You're saying that could be your problem?
I returned it to you, so you'll have to report it again.
Yes, I will pass this information on to your manager.
Yes, thank you for waiting, teacher.

There is a resident who has the highest total income for the tax period.
It is for his dependents who are eligible for deduction.
Okay, then I guess I should apply this time.

Hello, I have something to ask you.
Yes, teacher, please speak comfortably.
I would like to inquire about absence due to illness.
Any questions regarding sickness absence?
I heard that you only need to submit an asthma or allergy diagnosis once at the beginning of the semester.
So, is it true that I can skip school on days with a lot of fine dust or pollen?
Will my absence due to illness be recognized without having to resubmit a new medical certificate?
Yes, sir. I will check and let you know. Please wait a moment.
Thank you for waiting, teacher.
First, we plan to allow you to replace the medical certificate submitted at the beginning of the semester.
However, the law is currently being revised, so you still need to check it from time to time.
I see, I still have to submit it every time.
And teacher, there are criteria for acknowledging absence due to sickness due to air quality.
I think it would be best to proceed after discussing the child's condition with the teacher.
I think I should do it like you said. Thank you.

In the case of senior welfare facilities, only facilities with a senior welfare facility registration certificate are eligible.
Also, even if it is a possible hospital, if it goes against the purpose of student volunteer work, it will not be recognized.

For example, the roles that doctors, nurses, and hospital staff should play are not appropriate.
I see. Thank you for your kind advice.

Yes, how may I help you?
I am an office worker and I own an apartment in the province with a market price of about 200 million won.
I want to change this to my spouse's name, do I have to pay gift tax?
In the case of gifts between spouses, the deduction is limited to 600 million won when combined with the amount received within ten years.
So, if there is no gift within ten years and the market value of the gifted apartment is less than 600 million won, there is no separate taxation.
You're saying that it shouldn't exceed 600 million in ten years? Okay, I understand.
Yes, do you have any further questions?
No, it's okay, thank you

There are times when you need to notify or inform about the status of civil complaints.

You will receive an alarm when your complaint has been transferred, adjusted, or a response has been completed.
Okay, I'll contact you again if I have any other questions.

Hello, this is counselor #@name# from #@affiliation#
Yes, hello, I have something to ask.
Yes, what is your inquiry?
I'm curious as to what resale price maintenance is.
I am curious about what cases are considered violations of the Fair Trade Act.
Resale price maintenance refers to the act of a business entity trading goods or services.
Set a transaction price and force sale or provision at that price.
This refers to an act of trading with terms and conditions or other binding conditions attached.
Yes, that's right. It's a resale price maintenance act.
Businesses must not engage in resale price maintenance.
In other words, the business entity sets the transaction price for the other party to the transaction or the business entity at the next transaction stage.
It is stipulated that compliance with this be ensured.
Resale price maintenance is illegal because it restricts price competition and infringes on autonomy at the distribution stage.
Yes, thank you for your kind information.
Yes, thank you. I hope this answer was helpful.

Regarding the village head and township head, there is a person in charge from #@affiliation#
I will connect you directly to the representative number of #@affiliation#
I called there a lot, but there's no one in charge of wiretapping.
It is difficult to confirm the person in charge at the provincial government regarding the village head and township head.
Then where did Heejung and Ahn Heejung go?
It is difficult to talk directly to the governor.
Why not? Okay, I said not to do it without the governor.

I will check again to see if there is a closer distance and then let you know.
Could you please wait a moment?

Take bus number 81 and get off at the integrated terminal stop. You will need to walk for about ten minutes to the transfer stop.
I can't go there anymore. There's no car.
Yes, it is difficult to do it right away, and you have to move for about ten minutes.
I think it would be better to go to the location I guided you to.
Yes, I understand. Thank you.

Then where is this village you are talking about?
Second cousins are identified as brothers, sisters, and grandparents.

After getting off at your stop, you will need to walk approximately 766 meters to #@Address#.
How do I get there? There should be a car that goes to #@address#.
It is 766 meters. It takes about 11 minutes to walk.
But the bus doesn't go that far
Yes, teacher, according to the search results, the route is confirmed to get off at Dundun Village Station.
Then what time is the first train? The very first train.
Yes, I'm sorry, sir. I checked the first train and it's 7 o'clock. The first train is based on the garage.
Yes, so you're saying that you're going to the garage from Hongseong Terminal.
The first train to the rural area is confirmed at 7 o'clock
Okay, I understand
I hope your work goes well.
Hello, this is #@affiliation# call center. How may I help you?
I consulted about the bus from Taean Public Bus Terminal to Hongseong, but I think I got the time and fare wrong.
I checked the search results and it says it takes about an hour and twenty minutes to get to the destination.
The fare is confirmed to be 6,700 won.
In one hour and twenty minutes, I have to take another bus from the Hongseong terminal to #@address#.
Teacher, are you curious about the cost and time from Taean Terminal to #@Address#?
Where are you going between Hongseong Terminal and #@Address#?
I'm trying to go to #@address#
I checked the bus going to #@address# from the integrated bus terminal.
If you use the rural bus number 100 and 120, it takes about 49 minutes.
And there's nothing else?
If you take the 120th rural bus, it takes 58 minutes.
If you take the Rural Area Bus 121, it will take about an hour and two minutes.
Then the fastest one is now the rural area hundred times.
Yes, that's right. That's right.
Then how much is this?
Yes, if you are a regular person, it will be confirmed as one thousand two hundred and fifty won.
Yes, I understand. Thank you.
Hello, I am #@Affiliation# #@Name#. How may I help you?
What are you trying to do? Who should I talk to? This is serious.
I'm sorry, sir, but is this complaint related to the part you mentioned due to the heavy rain?
So I reported it to the daily district office and they are currently at the scene and handling the situation.
I made a fuss last year because of this, and I'm doing it again this year.
Originally, it was under the jurisdiction of the county office, but the story is that the district office said they were short on personnel.
I just checked with the government agency and they said I need to talk to the wiretapping department.
Any issues related to staff shortages are identified as something that needs to be addressed with the county office.
Isn't the problem of lack of personnel something that should be discussed at the city hall or the provincial government?
We will contact the wiretapping staff who can answer your question about the personnel supplementation issue and then provide you with guidance.
Could you please wait a moment?
Yes, then please connect me.
Excuse me, but what area are you from?
Yesan-gun #@Address# is located at #@Address#
We will guide you after checking with the person in charge.
We will contact the disaster response team and connect you with the person in charge of disaster recovery.
Is this a rural road?
Yes, it's a road like a road without an entrance.
The people who live there keep digging it up to use it as a road.
You're saying that they're digging up a place that isn't a road to make a road.
Yes, that's right, it's not a road, it's a ditch.
They are narrowing the ditches and widening the roads to make them wider.
Then, #@affiliation# came several times and took corrective action.
But still, once a year, without fail, they dig it up.
Even though we took corrective action, they keep digging
Yeah, but that's what happens once a year when this thing touches the land of the country.
I just wanted to ask if there is any legal action taken even though it is illegal.
Then I will contact the Road Traffic Department and give you guidance.
Could you please wait a moment?
Could you please check with the Road Traffic Department?
Yes, I will contact the road traffic department.
Yes, I will wait.
Yes, please wait a moment.
If so, can you report the damage to the welfare department?
Could you please pass this information on to the flood damage department you mentioned earlier?
Yes, I will pass it on to the relevant department.
And please check if the work related to basic welfare recipients is correct.
#@Affiliation# I think I need to talk to the staff.
Let's check what kind of complaint it is.
Is there any way for us to find out?
Can I contact you again after checking the complaint details?
Yes, please contact me again.
The complainant is very frustrated because there is no response.
What is the phone number you should be contacted by?
We are #@phone number#
What is your name?
My name is #@name# counselor. First of all, can you tell me the name of the teacher who answered the phone?
Yes, my name is #@name#
Yes, then please check.
Yes, I will check and call you back.
Yes, I understand. Thank you.
Hello, this is the Culture and Arts Team.
Is that so? The person who first answered the phone said he would connect me to the department in charge.
Send it to the department in charge
If so, which department should I contact for basic livelihood security benefits?
If it's simply related to basic livelihood security recipients, our welfare department will handle it.
I think it might be a different department if it's related to flood damage, but I don't know much about that part.
If so, could you please convey the details?
Okay, I'll convey the content. Then I'll write down the content.
Yes, you are #@name# currently residing in Taean. Your contact information is #@phone number#.
I have contacted #@affiliation# and #@affiliation# several times, but the issue has not been resolved.
So you called us
Because the complainant wants to be contacted.
I filed a complaint with the person in charge #@affiliation#, but they said it wasn't resolved.
Are you saying that part wasn't resolved and you didn't get an answer?
Yes, that's right, you didn't get an answer.
You are now again asking us to respond to #@affiliation#
Yes, I would like to request a response from #@affiliation#
I think I'll have to find the person in charge for this part.
I don't know much about this part
Yes, hello, this is #@affiliation#
Yes, hello. This is #@Phone# #@Affiliation# #@Name#. I'm calling to tell you something.
Even though #@Name#, who currently resides in Wonbuk-myeon, Taean, is a basic livelihood security recipient,
Then we will connect you to that department.
Excuse me, but this is the switchboard you called from. There is a separate department in charge of that. Just a moment.
Yes, I understand. Please connect me. Thank you.
Hello, what's going on?
Hello, this is #@Phone# #@Affiliation# #@Name#. I'm calling to tell you something.
#@Name#, who currently lives in Wonbuk-myeon, Taean, is a basic livelihood security recipient.
I contacted Wonbuk #@affiliation# and #@affiliation# about the flood damage, but it was not resolved.
So, you called #@affiliation#
We, #@Affiliation#, called to convey the information to #@Affiliation#.
Do you know anything about this part?
No, why are you doing that?
I have filed several complaints to #@affiliation# and #@affiliation# due to flood damage.
But you called us and said the issue hasn't been resolved yet.
What is the complaint? Is this the area that was damaged by flooding? Is this the area that you want to repair?
Yes, I want to restore the damage.
Is it true that you are damaging ditches and rivers without a permit for occupying local roads?
Could you please tell me the exact location?
Is this address #@Geumsan-gun, Chungcheongnam-do?
Yes, the river behind #@address#
#@Address# Is the river behind it damaged?
Yes, river damage and road damage.
But that keeps getting dug up once a year
For three years, has the person in charge at #@affiliation# been taking money and turning a blind eye to it?
I don't know what to do, so I'm asking because I'm frustrated.
I bet you were very frustrated, teacher.
#@Affiliation# Should I go to the civil affairs office to file a complaint or where should I file a complaint?
Or should I call a reporter and do it?
The reason why no action is taken is because I want to know the reason why no action is taken.
Yes, teacher, I understand what you said.
After checking with the person in charge of the department, we will contact the teacher immediately.
Do you have any further questions?
No, no questions, thank you
Yes, I will contact you right away. It was #@Affiliation# #@Name#
I contacted #@affiliation#, teacher.
If the road you mentioned is a local road, you can check it at the general construction office.
But if it is a road in a village, it is a matter for the mayor and county governor.
So, you need to contact the relevant region #@affiliation# to get an accurate answer.
The wiretapping department is saying that there is no jurisdiction over the wiretapping department.
In the case of local roads, it was passed on to the responsible department.
Are you sure this is a local road?
Yes, that's a local road, but even if I complain to the district office, they won't fix it.
Yes, you mentioned Guger, but Guger is next to the river road.
But even if I tell #@affiliation# about it for 100 days, it is not being corrected
I don't know if I should talk to the government office's civil affairs office.
Okay, then I'll give it a try
If you don't accept it even in your wiretapping
Yes, is this the inquiry regarding the damage to the river road next to the ditch in #@affiliation#?
Yes, they keep trying to use it as a road, but if they get permission to use it as a road, it doesn't matter.
But they dig once a year without permission.
They've been digging like that for three years and still nothing has been done.
Is it true that you are damaging ditches or rivers without a road use permit?
Yes, but there is no legal action and it is not being watched.
I'm wondering if I should report this to the higher-level government agency or the wiretapping civil affairs office.
I'm checking to see if I should go to the government office's civil affairs office, but it seems like it'll take a little more time.
After checking, please leave your teacher's name and contact information and we will call you right away.
Yes, my name is #@Phone# #@Name#
Have you contacted #@affiliation#?
Yes, I've done it several times to #@affiliation#, but even though I sell it once a year, no action has been taken.
So is it okay to dig that up once a year?
I asked once, but they didn't take any action.
Are you saying that there is no action?
They say that even if you dig it up once a year, they will come back and restore it to its original state.
Then we dig it up again once a year
Yes, it must have been very inconvenient.
I'll check this part. Could you please wait a moment?
Yes I will wait. Thank you.
Thank you for waiting. The roads and rivers you mentioned each have separate departments.
Which way should I direct you?
Regarding rivers, I checked and found that there is a river safety department in the provincial government.
And you can also check it at the general construction business office.
Yes, it's a country road, it's a country muddy water, it's muddy valley water.
Is this a question about ditches?
Yes, it's a big ditch, but they keep digging it up and trying to use it, so they keep narrowing it.
Even if you want to use it, it is a place where you don't even get a permit to use the river road.
But I was so annoyed that they only dug it up once a year
#@Affiliation# Even if I tell the person in charge about it for 100 days, it doesn't work out
So I wanted to ask if there are any legal sanctions.
Yes, we will check it and contact you. Thank you.
Nice to meet you, I am #@Affiliation# #@Name# How may I help you?
Yes, thank you for your hard work. I would like to ask the architecture department to take charge of the old building.
Do you have any questions about Guger?
I would like to inquire about the road and river
Is this an inconvenience inquiry?
Yes, I have something to ask you.
Teacher, in relation to roads and rivers, each task is assigned to a different person.
If you could be a little more specific, I will check with the person in charge and then give you guidance.
I heard you were in charge of the old building
It is difficult for the person in charge to confirm separately
Then, they keep digging up rivers and roads.
I was wondering who I should ask to dig into this, so I contacted you.
Roads and rivers are each divided into departments.
Could you tell me which road and which river you mentioned?
Can you tell me which road, river or local river it is?
Is this a complaint regarding return shipping?
Yes, I have a question regarding the return.
Could you please tell me which area it is?
I'd like to contact Geumsan
Okay, then I'll check and connect you.
Are you correct about the part about damaging ditches and rivers without a permit for occupying local roads? Could you tell me the exact location?
Is this address #@Geumsan-gun, Chungcheongnam-do?
Yes, it's the river behind number 1.
Is the river behind the first street damaged?
Yes, river damage and road damage, but they keep digging it up once a year.
I can't understand why the person in charge of Geumsan County took money and turned a blind eye to it for three years.
I'm asking because I'm frustrated right now. Should I go to Sejong City and go to the civil affairs office to file a complaint? Or where should I go to file a complaint?
Otherwise, I'm calling a reporter and asking why things aren't being done. I'm asking because I want to know why things aren't being done.
Yes, teacher. I will contact you right away after checking with the person in charge of the department you mentioned. Do you have any other questions?
No, there is no problem, thank you
Yes, I will contact you right away. It was #@Affiliation# #@Name#
I asked the wiretapping road traffic department and they said that if the road you mentioned is a provincial road, it can be checked at the general construction business office.
If it is a road in a village, you must contact the Geumcheon-gu Office, which is the mayor's office, to get an accurate answer.
The wiretapping department is saying that there is no jurisdiction over the wiretapping department.
If it is a local road, I have received information from the responsible department. Is it a local road?
Yes, that's a local road, but even if I complain to the district office, they won't fix it.
Yes, you mentioned Guger, but is there a river road next to Guger?
But since even if I bring up the issue to the Geumsan-gu Office, no action will be taken, if not the district office, where else should I bring up the issue, to the government office?
Should I just go to the government office's civil affairs office and talk to them?
Okay, then I'll give it a try
If your wiretapping doesn't accept it either
Yes, are you referring to the inquiry regarding the damage to the river road next to the ditch in Geumsan-gun?
Yes, it damages the road and reduces the width of the road by about a third.
They keep saying they'll use it as a road, but if they get permission for road use, it doesn't matter.
They keep digging like that once a year for three years without a permit, and yet no action is taken.
Is it true that you are damaging ditches or rivers without a road use permit?
Yes, but there is no legal action and it is not being watched.
I was wondering if I should report this to the higher-level government agency or the wiretapping civil affairs office.
If that's the case, I'll have to check with the government office's civil affairs office, but it seems like it'll take a little more time.
After checking, please leave your teacher's name and contact information and we will call you right away.
Yes, my name is #@Phone# #@Name#
Have you contacted Geumsan-gu Office?
Yes, I've been to Geumsan-gu Office several times, but even though I file a complaint once a year, they haven't done anything about it.
So I was going to ask if it was okay to dig it up once a year, but they didn't do anything about it.
Even if you dig it up once a year, they say they'll come back and restore it to its original state, and then they dig it up again once a year.
Yes, it must have been very inconvenient.
I checked this part and the roads and rivers you mentioned are each divided into departments.
Which way should I direct you?
Regarding rivers, I checked and found that the river safety department of the provincial government and the general construction business office can also confirm.
Yes, it's a country road, a country muddy water, a muddy valley water.
Is this a question about ditches?
Yes, it's a big ditch, but they keep digging it up and using it, so they keep narrowing it down.
I don't even have a permit to use the river road, so why do they dig it up once a year? I've been talking to the person in charge of the Geumsan-gu Office about it for 100 days, but nothing happens.
So I wanted to ask if there were any legal sanctions.
By the way, is this a rural road?
Yes, it is a road with no access road, but the people living there keep digging it up to use it as a road, narrowing the ditch and widening the road.
Then, Geumsan-gu Office came several times to take corrective action, but they kept digging up the land once a year.
But I'm going to ask you once a year if there is no legal action if this touches national land.
Then I will contact the Road Traffic Department and give you some more information. Could you please wait a moment?
Yes, I will wait.
Yes, teacher, I'm really sorry for keeping you waiting for so long.
Nice to meet you, I am #@Affiliation# #@Name# How may I help you?
Yes, thank you for your hard work. I would like to ask the architecture department to take charge of the old building.
Do you have any questions about Guger?
I would like to inquire about the road and river
Is this an inconvenience inquiry?
Yes, I have something to ask you.
Teacher, in relation to roads and rivers, each task is assigned a different person.
If you could tell me a little more about the job description, I will check with the person in charge and then give you guidance.
I heard you were in charge of the old building
It is difficult for the person in charge to confirm separately
Then, there are rivers and roads, and they keep digging them up, so who should I ask about that?
Roads and rivers are each divided into departments.
Could you tell me which road and which river you mentioned?
Is it a road, river or local river?
Is this a complaint regarding return shipping?
Yes, I have a question regarding the return.
Could you please tell me which area you are in?
I would like to contact Geumsan

Hello, this is #@Affiliation# #@Name#, Chief Officer.

There were many complaints about the lack of traffic-related signs at the roundabout in Dangjin IC.
Please check if this section is a national road managed by the National Land Management Office.
Yes, Dangjin IC roundabout. Just a moment.
Yes, please confirm.
Yes, this section is a road that we manage, but I think you are talking about Route 32 of the delegated country.
A You said that there was a roundabout on the road right after you exited Dangjin IC.

Are you not related?
Yes, but we keep getting complaints like that.
Then, which way should I guide you regarding the Doctor Helicopter?
Well, helicopters from various departments across the country go there and do maintenance.

#@Address# is there a defect in the entire apartment?
Yes, there are defects throughout the apartment, and our house has one too.
I've been fighting this for months now and I'm not happy with the city's response.
They keep responding to us by arguing with us even though they can't fix it now.
That's why I contacted you because I thought I needed to take other measures through #@affiliation#
Excuse me, but could you please tell me your teacher's name and contact information?
Yes, my name is #@name# and my phone number is #@phone#
Yes, I understand. I will check with the department and forward the information to you.
Yes, please contact me.
I hope your work goes well #@Affiliation#
Hello, this is #@affiliation#. Can I talk to you?
Yes, this is the Department of Architecture and Urban Planning. What are you doing?
The complainant called regarding a defect in a completed apartment.
The area is Asan City, and I filed a complaint with Asan City Hall, but they said it was not processed.
Yeah, what kind of apartment is it?
They couldn't confirm which apartment it was, and said they were inquiring about a defect in the apartment.
I'm looking for the person in charge of the defect, but isn't #@Name# in charge's position?
Wait a minute. Yes, #@Name# is currently on vacation.
Yes, sir, are you on vacation? Then, is the team leader at his office?
Your team leader is in his seat.
Okay, I understand. I'll connect you with the team leader. Thank you.
Nice to meet you, this is #@Affiliation#. How may I help you?
Hello, #@Affiliation#, right? Can you help me file a complaint?
Hello, what is your complaint?
There were so many defects in the apartment that I called #@affiliation# several times.
But the computer room responded in a very unpleasant way.
From what I've seen, it seems like this is a problem that #@affiliation# can't solve on its own.
They say they are still negotiating with the construction company for the apartment complex.
Nothing has changed, but the repair team is acting all brazen as if they are doing it.
Is that so? Is the apartment you live in a completed apartment?
Yes, I already moved in and live there.
Then I will check with the person in charge and give you the information. Could you please wait a moment?
Yes, I will wait for your confirmation.
Thank you for waiting. We will connect you with the person in charge of the Architecture and Urban Planning Department.
Yes, please connect me with the person in charge. Thank you.
Thank you, I hope your work goes smoothly.
Nice to meet you, this is #@Affiliation#. How may I help you?
Hello, I had an accident in the road construction area under the jurisdiction of #@affiliation#.
The county office is responsible for management and supervision, and the construction company is responsible for safety negligence.
But neither the city officials nor the construction company are willing to take responsibility.
I'm sorry, teacher, but have you filed a complaint with the #@affiliation# audit department regarding this matter?
No, I haven't tried it on your side. I filed a complaint with the wiretapping office first.
If talking about it here doesn't solve the problem, I think I'll have to talk about it in the newspaper.
I don't know why I have to go through all this trouble to claim compensation.
Teacher, if that's the case, could you first file a complaint with the #@affiliation# audit department?
I am in charge of auditing the work of affiliated public officials.
Then, shall I contact you there first?
I think it would be best to contact the county office's audit department and file a complaint.
Okay, then please connect me to the county audit department.
Yes, teacher, I will connect you directly to the representative number of #@affiliation#
Yes, thank you. Thank you for your hard work.
Nice to meet you, this is #@Affiliation#. How may I help you?
Yes, I'm the person who said there was an accident at the construction site. Is it okay for me to talk to you?
Could you please continue what you said just now?
Yes, I called the city hall because I thought they would come up with a solution if I filed a complaint.
But after hearing the details of the accident, he didn't even ask how badly I was injured.
Then he told me out of the blue that the county office had no insurance or compensation measures.
But I didn't call him to hear that story.
Honestly, whether there was such a measure or not, it has nothing to do with me.
The city government left the construction site unsafe without any safety measures or signs.
It's not like India was left defenseless.
Yes, teacher, please continue speaking.
It was night so I couldn't see and that's why I fell.
But instead of asking me how badly I was hurt, he asked me why I fell forward.
Then the military said they couldn't give any compensation.
He told me to contact the government agency that provides compensation.
What more can I say to someone who talks like that?
That's why I contacted you directly at #@affiliation#
Teacher, how heartbroken were you by the sudden accident in the middle of the night?
I'll connect you to the civil affairs office for this section. Would you like to come in for a consultation?
Yes, then I will go to the civil affairs office and ask for advice. Thank you.
Nice to meet you, this is #@Affiliation#. How may I help you?
Yes, hello. Thank you for your hard work. My name is #@name# and I live in Seoul.
Before I moved, I went to Taean, South Chungcheong Province, to do some research.
#@Affiliation# is doing road construction and I got hurt a lot due to management negligence.
So I contacted #@affiliation# and spoke to the construction contractor.
At first, the construction company said they would cover it up.
When I had the accident, I sent you photos and explained the details.
Then the accident happened at 9pm and I reported it to the police and the coast guard.
Yes, teacher, please continue speaking.
The accident happened on Friday, and I spoke to the construction contractor on Saturday.
I was told to file a complaint with the county office on Monday, so I did.
So you filed a complaint with #@affiliation# on Monday this week?
Yes, I spoke to someone at the county office on Monday.
Excuse me, I have an important call coming in. Can I call you back later?
Yes, you can contact me at the same number.
Teacher, this is #@Affiliation# #@Name#. You just contacted me through the highway sign.
I would like to pass on what you mentioned to #@affiliation#
We may contact you to ensure accurate processing of your work.
Excuse me, but if you tell me your name and contact information, I can send it to you.
My name is #@name# and my number is #@phone#
Is the road you mentioned the rotary in Dangjin Gijisi?
Yes, it's a rotary and there used to be a signal, but they've completely removed it.
And then we made the rotary rotator, which is popular these days.
They said they finished the construction by going around and around like that.
That's really inconvenient, so please make sure to convey the information to that side.
I'm sorry, but it's difficult to confirm the location with just a rotary rotary.
Could you please confirm the address of the place where the rotary is located?
We don't know the address, but #@address# is the national road, so it's on the highway.
We are now coming out on the West Seoul IC.
Giji City #@Address# National Road Rotary
Yes, if you take that and get off at #@address#, there's a rotary right after you get off.
Yes, then I will forward it to the part you asked about. Do you have any other questions?
No, nothing else. Just do that quickly.
Yes, I will pass on your information. Thank you.
Nice to meet you, I am #@Affiliation# #@Name# How may I help you?
I'm saying this because I'm having a hard time
I'm sorry, teacher. Could you please say that again?
I'm having a hard time, but can you come to #@Affiliation#?
Excuse me, teacher, but what kind of work do you do?
My dad didn't give me a cell phone. When I was hospitalized, he never came to see me.
My father ran away because he didn't want to see me, and then he called me his enemy instead of his son.
I reported it to the police last time, but my dad won't give me my phone because of that.
I'm sorry, teacher, but I cannot answer the question you mentioned in #@affiliation#.
If you need help with anything from the police, why not try calling #@phone number#?
They say that if you dial #@phone number# there, it will work
So, what exactly is your job?
Is there anything you need legal advice on?
Yes, I would like to get legal advice.
I will guide you to the free legal consultation center.
Yes, thank you. I will try to contact you. Thank you.
Nice to meet you, I'm #@Affiliation# #@Name# How may I help you?
Yes, I have a question for you.
I want to take a picture of a parking violation with my smartphone and report it.
How should I proceed with that?
Are you inquiring about how to report a parking violation using your smartphone?
They say there is an app for that
I will check and let you know.
I checked and it seems that the app for reporting inconveniences in daily life has been confirmed.
Wait a minute, I have a note to report an inconvenience in my life.
Please attach your photo to confirm that it is a reportable part.
If there is the same car, I will take a picture of it today and upload it.
I'll upload it again tomorrow and the day after tomorrow
Then it is imposed on each person
Teacher, it is difficult for us to confirm that part.
For inquiries regarding parking work, please contact the local city/county office.
Yes, I understand.
Yes, do you have any other questions?
No, it's okay. Thank you for your hard work.
Nice to meet you, I'm #@Affiliation# #@Name# How may I help you?
No, I just wanted to report some roadkill.
I bet you were very surprised, teacher.
Roadkill reports are verified by different agencies depending on the road in question.
Is the road you found a general road, a local road, or a national road?
I'm confused whether it's a regular road or a national road.
If you are not sure about the type of road, please contact your local city or county office.
What area did you find it in?
This is the Nonghyup Training Center #@Affiliation#
Yes, teacher. I will check and let you know.
Yes, please do that.
Thank you for waiting, teacher.
I searched and found that it is difficult to confirm #@affiliation# near Sejong City and Gongju City.
Then, please search for #@affiliation#
Yes, sir, your location is confirmed as Sejong Special Self-Governing City #@Address#
I know it's inconvenient, but please contact #@Affiliation# #@Phone#
Yes, I understand. Thank you.
Yes, please drive safely. #@Affiliation# #@Name#
Nice to meet you, I'm #@Affiliation# #@Name# How may I help you?
Yes, I'm currently looking at the #@affiliation# homepage.
#@Affiliation# There is a rule or regulation that should be called a guideline, but I couldn't find it, so I'm calling you.
Yes sir, what are the rules for the guidelines?
Something like a permit for connection to another road.
Yes, I will check and let you know.
Could you please wait a moment, sir?
Yes, I will wait.
Yes, I checked with the local government ordinance information system and I can confirm the ordinance regarding the connection of #@affiliation# roads and other facilities.
Is this the ordinance you are looking for?
Yes, that's right. How do you see it?
Yes, teacher, you said you were accessing the #@affiliation# homepage.
If you hover your mouse over Administration, can you see that it is Legal Administration?
Yes, I see the legal administration
Yes, you can click on the section under Legal Administration to view the local government laws.
Yes, click on view.
If you click, I will search by road for that law name.
Yes, I checked, thank you
Do you have any other questions?
No, there isn't. Thank you for your effort.
I hope your work goes well #@Affiliation# #@Name#
Nice to meet you, I'm #@Affiliation# #@Name# How may I help you?
Hello, I'm in front of #@affiliation# right now.
Yes, teacher, please speak.
I need to call a taxi here. Can you tell me how?
Are you talking about the call taxi number?
Yeah and I don't know exactly where this is
Teacher, can you tell me where to call a taxi?
Can you take notes now?
Notes are not available right now
Is that so? Then how may I help you?
What area exactly is this?
Located at #@Address# in Hongseong-gun
Then it's Chungcheongnam-do
Yes, that's right, teacher.
Yes, thank you. I think I can solve it.
Yes, have a happy day #@Affiliation# #@Name#
Yes hello this is #@name#
Yes, hello, this is #@affiliation#
I have a question.
Hey, what's going on?
If the complainant requests to be connected to another department, the complainant waits and I talk to a government official.
Yeah, usually.
However, if the complainant quits and the civil servant also quits, the AP stops.
What do you mean by AP stopping?
I think it would be nice to come and see it, but it freezes so I can't save anything.
So all the recordings and history were gone.
That seems a bit serious
Is this a problem that happens occasionally or not every time?
It's already happened twice today
Okay, okay, I understand for now.
I'll stop what you said first and check if it's not being recorded.
When the caller ends the call, the light normally blinks red to indicate that the call has ended.
But it stops without that
Yes, first I will talk to the AP company.
Yes hello this is #@name#
Yes, hello, this is #@affiliation#
I'm calling because I have something to tell you.
Yes what's the problem
You went to see that the number you searched for was different from the number you searched for before.
Yeah, I saw it then
Yes, but I called to inquire because there were several similar situations today.
First, I'll talk to the company that made it tomorrow.
I think there might be some error in that company's database.
Then, I think you can save the company number separately and call us again at #@affiliation#
Yes, I will do that.
Yes, hello
Hello, this is #@Affiliation# #@Name#, sir.
I'm calling to ask you a question regarding housing law.
Yeah, what is it? Housing law
The petitioner wanted to know about the distance regulations between houses and utility poles.
I mentioned KEPCO, but the person in charge was not there, so I asked if the wiretapping department could provide an answer.
Distance between a residential building and a utility pole
Wait a minute, where did you originally call from?
You said you contacted KEPCO
Just a moment, let me check.
Yes please, thank you
I think we should also ask KEPCO about this.
Okay, it's hard to confirm with the wiretapping department. I'll pass it on to you.
Yes, I understand. Thank you.
Excuse me, sir, what is your name?
Yes, I am #@name#
#@Name# Thank you, sir
Nice to meet you, I'm #@Affiliation# #@Name# How may I help you?
Yes, I just moved into the neighborhood, and the distance between my house and the utility pole is very short.
I roughly measured it with a tape measure, and it's only about fifty centimeters.
The distance between the house and the electric pole
Yes, so I submitted the previous application to KEPCO.
Isn't there some kind of regulation about the distance between this house and a utility pole?
I called because I wanted to know about that.
Have you not received an answer from KEPCO regarding that regulation?
They say there is such a regulation, but since there is no one in charge, I haven't heard anything about what the regulation is.
Yes, I think KEPCO can answer the question about the distance from the utility pole.
I will check with the person in charge of wiretapping housing and let you know after checking with the person in charge.
Yes, I understand. Please.
Teacher, I'm really sorry for keeping you waiting for so long.
No, yes, it's okay
Yes, I checked with the person in charge at the Architecture and Urban Planning Department, but it is difficult to confirm the person in charge at the provincial government.
I got a reply that I should inquire with KEPCO about the distance at which the utility pole should be installed.
I see, yes, thank you
Yes I appreciate it more I'm really sorry I couldn't help you
No, it's okay. Thank you for your hard work.
I hope your work goes well #@Affiliation# #@Name#

Yes, how may I help you?
What is a real-time Ian Ryu monitoring service?
This is a system that notifies beach lifeguards of the possibility of rip currents.
Its purpose is to help evacuate and rescue beachgoers.
When did this service come into existence?
It was first implemented at Haeundae Beach in 2011.

Hello, I am counselor #@Affiliation# and #@Name#
How can I help you?
I would like to make some suggestions regarding teachers’ double benefits and double receipts.
Is the question about the salary and allowance of educational civil servants and their service period?
Yes, I would like to request reform of the old evils.
There is a special law for improving the status of teachers and protecting educational activities for educational officials.
There are the Education Civil Servant Act, Civil Servant Salary Regulations, and Civil Servant Allowances, etc.
In accordance with these laws, compensation, etc. must be paid.
Is there such a law?
It is processed in accordance with the Education Civil Servant Act and the National Civil Servant Service Regulations.
Okay, then please handle it according to the law.
For further inquiries, please contact #@affiliation#
Please contact us and we will be happy to assist you.

KTX #@Other#I have some questions regarding the station
#@Address# What is the number of requests for holding a resident briefing session and cancellation of the KTX?
Yes, the number of requests for hosting is confirmed to be one hundred and fifty-two, and the minimum request is approximately three.
Why did you only hold information sessions for residents of other local governments?
#@Address# The KTX business does not include development activities for the #@Address# vehicle base facility.
Therefore, #@Address# vehicle base is not included in the scope of the resident briefing session according to the Environmental Impact Assessment Act.
So, we held a resident briefing session for other development target areas.
Then, please let me know the results of the environmental impact assessment due to the KTX parking at #@Address# vehicle base
During the day, it is about 54 decibels, and at night, it is about 46 decibels, which is below the noise control standard.
Okay, I understand for now.

Is it possible to not issue a voice test result?
Which public health center did you get tested at?
I got it from Daejeon #@affiliation#
Currently, #@Affiliation# is conducting more than 600 tests per day.
Also, the number of confirmed cases has been increasing rapidly recently.
Yes, the number of confirmed cases has suddenly increased.
Yes, so our main job is to conduct tests for early detection of confirmed cases.
Therefore, issuing a negative COVID-19 test result is currently impossible.
Okay, so this wasn't the case originally?
No, it was possible originally, but the number of confirmed cases has increased recently.
Please understand that I cannot do much other work besides inspection.
Okay, I understand. Thank you for your hard work.
Yes, we will take action to improve the system in the future.

Nice to meet you, I am #@Affiliation# #@Name#

What part exactly are you talking about?
Please manage vehicles entering and exiting the construction site.
The roads are a mess because of those cars.
First of all, we apologize for any inconvenience caused by vehicles entering and exiting the construction site.
Are you talking about a construction site?
Here in Jinan-gun #@Address# Here is the construction site
Yes, the soil that has flowed into the road appears to have been cleaned up.
If work like this is carried out in the future, we will take action by mobilizing a water cannon.
Yes, it's already dry because it's winter, but the fine dust makes me uncomfortable.
Yes, I understand. If you have any further questions, please contact #@phone number#

This index is provided to support citizens' safe maritime activities.
What specific information is provided?
This is forecast information on tide times, current, water temperature, wind speed, air temperature, and weather.
So how is the Living Ocean Forecast Index composed?

Yes, I would like to file a complaint regarding #@affiliation#
Yes, what is the problem that brought you to my attention?
Because the department's handling of complaints is too slow
Yes, we will help you with your complaint regarding the delay in processing your complaint.
If it's more than a month late, there's a problem.
I apologize on your behalf.
As a result of the verification, the first civil complaint was filed and the Ministry of Health and Welfare was designated as the institution.
Now, I have been assigned to the person in charge of #@affiliation# through Gyeonggi-do.
It is judged that the delay occurred because the person in charge was not aware of the fact that it had been received during this process.
Yes, please help me solve it.
Yes, I will try to resolve it quickly.

I would like to inquire about rusty tap water.
Thank you for your interest in our water administration.
You have filed a complaint about the inconvenience caused by the green water.
Yes, that's right. I filed a complaint like that.
If the cause of the rust is indoor plumbing, you will need to improve the indoor water pipes.
So, I will introduce you to the indoor water pipe improvement support project that our business office is promoting.
Is there such a business?
Yes, the cost of construction of public housing and public water pipes is supported up to 50 million won.

Yeah, the fence here looks too dangerous.
I'll check it out. Could you please wait a moment?
Yes, thank you for waiting.
Currently, the land is registered as my private property at #@address#
The landowner installed a fence to prevent unauthorized entry into the land.
I didn't know that was private property.
Yes, so it is difficult to demolish or replace without the owner's consent.
The owner doesn't change it
Yes, the owner wants to maintain the current status to protect property rights.
Well, that looks really dangerous. What should I do?
Now our military is planning to install its own wooden fence.
Okay, I understand. Please hurry up. It looks dangerous.

Please allow middle and high school students subject to self-quarantine to take midterm and final exams
We have confirmed that you have inquired about taking the school-specific assessment for students who are in self-quarantine.
Yes, that's right, please let me get evaluated.
Here are the guidelines for preventing and managing coronavirus infections in elementary, middle, and special schools
According to this, if you receive a self-quarantine notice from #@affiliation#
We ask you to refrain from going to school or work and to self-isolate at home for this week.
Yeah I know that part
Based on this, I will tell you about the guidelines.
Attendance will be acknowledged for students who are subject to school suspension.
We strive to minimize disadvantages in evaluation.
There are #@affiliation#'s academic performance management guidelines and the school's academic performance management regulations.
Accordingly, we are giving 100% recognition points.
That's how it works
Please understand that this is an inevitable measure to prevent the spread and spread of coronavirus infection.

I suggested preemptive testing for COVID-19 and I'm curious to know what happened.
Yes, we have confirmed that the content you have inquired about is related to preemptive testing for COVID-19 for childcare staff.
BThat's correct
I will give you my opinion after reviewing your inquiry.
Recently, there has been continued transmission of infection into the community following infections among daycare users and workers.
We are working to prevent the spread of coronavirus in daycare centers that are not eligible for vaccination.
It is necessary to conduct a comprehensive inspection of all daycare teachers and staff nationwide on the 1st of every month.
Please be advised that if you do not fulfill your obligation to conduct a preemptive inspection, you may be subject to disposition in accordance with relevant laws.
Yes, that's how it's going.
The director should arrange for preemptive inspections on weekdays.
Time spent out is not deducted from personal annual leave and a proxy must be appointed within the company.
As for preemptive inspection, it has nothing to do with years of service.
Yes, this is what is currently happening.
We will use the opinions you have sent as reference material for future policy making.
Yes, if you have any further questions, please contact #@affiliation#
Please contact us and we will be happy to assist you.

Yes, hello, I would like to make a suggestion about the factory here.
Yes, what are you talking about?
This is Jinan-gun #@address#
There is a village a minute away from here and a field right beyond #@Address#
In this typical rural town, there is a factory that is not even a typical industrial complex.
It's not only bad for the image, but it also causes carcinogens to enter our bodies.
Yes, first of all, I apologize for any inconvenience caused by factory noise and dust.
No, that's why I'm curious
There should also be measures against dust and machine noise.
I wonder if there are any countermeasures against hazardous substances
Yes, the above business establishment reported the installation of an air emission facility to Jinan County.
We have and operate a filtration facility to purify pollutants.
Then is it definitely safe?
About the pollutants you're concerned about?
In accordance with the Air Quality Conservation Act, we measure and manage the air quality every two months.
We will continue to manage operations in compliance with relevant regulations.
Yes, I understand. I know you have a lot going on.
This is a matter directly related to the health of local residents, so I would appreciate it if you could pay attention to it.
Yes, I will do my best #@Affiliation# #@Name#

Yes, hello, I would like to make a suggestion.
Yes, please tell me what it is about.
I would like to suggest using biodegradable food waste bags.
Yes, this is about improving the method of disposing of food waste.
The idea is to use biodegradable food waste bags as a disposal method.
Yes, that's right. I'd like to make a suggestion.
Currently, in all areas of Daejeon including our district
When disposing of food waste, you attach a payment receipt to a dedicated container and dispose of it.
We are adopting and implementing a volume-based fee system for food waste.
Yes, that's right. I use a pay-as-you-go system.
Food waste usually has a high moisture content.
So there is a high possibility of moisture leakage or damage to the envelope.
Therefore, we ask for your understanding in adopting the method of discharging the container.
Yes, I understand that.
We will take your comments into consideration when reviewing future improvements to waste disposal methods.
Yes, thank you.

Hello, this is Samdangwon #@Name#
Hello, I would like to make a complaint regarding Daejeon #@affiliated#elementary school.
#@Affiliation#What kind of complaint is this regarding elementary school?
Here, in 2022, I'm planning to move into the #@affiliation# apartment.
Teacher, many other people have asked questions or made complaints about this.
So, does it make sense to respond so passively?
They say that next year there will be overcrowding in schools, so we need to come up with a solution.
I understand that the school building is currently undergoing renovation.
You're saying that all you can do is add 5 classrooms? That doesn't make sense.
First of all, this is something that was decided after conducting a demand forecast survey at #@affiliation#
If you want to investigate, you have to do it right. They say you need at least ten more.
Or, you could adjust the school district so that they can send them to a different elementary school.
Teacher, there is nothing more we can tell you.
I'll give you the contact information of the person in charge, so please inquire with them.
I will do that. Please let me know who is in charge of the order.
#@Affiliation# and #@Name# are the officers in charge and #@Phone# is
Okay, I'll call you back.
Thank you, counselor #@name#
Hello, this is #@Affiliation# #@Name#

Yes, do you want to improve the coverage at #@address#?
Yes, I called because I thought you might need it.
Yes, we will pass this information on to you so that we can actively review it when we proceed with road maintenance in this section in the future.
Thank you for your interest in city development.

Hello, I am counselor #@Affiliation# and #@Name#
How can I help you?
I have some questions regarding the notice of violation of national rights. How is it progressing?
Yes, I have checked the details you requested.
Currently, we have announced the restrictions and conditions for the capture and harvest of non-fishermen.
Yes, that's what I'm doing now.
We will review improvement measures regarding the abolition of the public notice requested by the teacher.
#@Affiliation# is using a village fishing license in accordance with the Fisheries Act.
Village fishing rights are rights granted to use a certain area of water.
The fishing village is in charge of managing the fishing grounds.
Please take into account that the village fishing grounds are the livelihood of female divers and their livelihood depends on them.
Even though it may be a bit inconvenient, I hope you understand with a broad mind.
Yeah, that can't be helped
We also inform you that fishing is managed by the Fisheries Management and Development Act.
Please take good care of me.
Please review what I suggested.
Yes, if you have any further questions, please contact #@affiliation#
Please contact us and we will be happy to assist you.

Have a nice day, this was counselor #@name#
This is #@Affiliation# #@Name#, bringing you happiness. How may I help you?
Yes, I moved into the new city of #@address# this time.
#@Address# You said new city, but are you talking about Pyeongtaek City?
Yes, it's #@address#, I just got there
My baby entered #@guitar#elementary school
But it's not like it's a mess
They say there are twenty-seven or twenty-eight students in a class, but it was like that in my time.
Nowadays, most people are around twenty, right?
So I'm curious to know how you plan to resolve this.
Yes, teacher, it must have been uncomfortable.
Godeok International New Town #@Other#Elementary school, right?
Currently, #@Other# elementary schools have 26 students per class.
As of now, it is confirmed that there is no overcrowding.
So how many people do you think would be considered overcrowded?
It's hard for me to answer your question about clear criteria.
If you would like to know about the criteria, I can connect you to the relevant department.
Then where is the department in charge of this work?
Yes, Gyeonggi-do #@affiliation#
Then could you please give me your contact information?
Yes, just a moment #@Affiliation# My number is #@Phone#
I hope your work goes smoothly. This was counselor #@name#.
Hello, this is counselor #@name#
Hello, I would like to inquire about violation of the Anti-Bribery Act for Teachers.
Could you please tell me specifically what it is about?
A teacher received a dinner worth about 30,000 won from someone related to his job.
Is the amount exactly thirty thousand won?
Yes, and I moved to a cafe and got a coffee for about 6,000 won.
Dinner is thirty thousand won, coffee is six thousand won, total thirty-six thousand won.
Yes, in this case, is it a violation of the Anti-Bribery Act?
If the food and drink are judged to be close in time and place,
You can evaluate once instead of twice
Then it is a violation
Yes, because it exceeded the 30,000 won per person food allowance.
This case can be seen as a violation of the law prohibiting solicitation of faculty and staff.
Okay, thanks for checking
Thank you, counselor #@name#
Hello, this is #@Affiliation# #@Name#

Hello, this is counselor #@name#
It's just that the noise is too loud because construction is going on at #@Affiliation# Elementary School.
Are you looking to file a complaint about construction noise?
Yes, it's so noisy that people can't live there.
Just a moment, I'll check.
Teacher #@Elementary school is currently undergoing cafeteria expansion construction
I know that, but it's so noisy early in the morning that I can't sleep.
Is that so? Other people have already filed related complaints.
So, we have requested noise prevention measures from the construction company.
Okay, so when will it be resolved?
First, we will receive preventive measures and continue discussions.
If you would like to inquire further, I will provide you with the contact information of the person in charge.
Please let me know who is in charge

Hello, this is counselor #@Affiliation#, #@Name#
What is your inquiry?
Yes, hello, I would like to give you some suggestions for improvement.
Right now, the city is recruiting households that are eligible for home improvement projects on its website.
Yes, that's right, teacher.
But why is the support target limited to women only?
It is gender discrimination to limit the applicants to women when it is a home recruitment.
Doesn't it create the misconception that housekeeping is primarily the responsibility of women?
Yes, teacher, first of all, thank you for your interest in the city-sponsored project.
And I apologize for any inconvenience caused by the information you provided.
Yes, if you can quickly review it, I would like to request a re-announcement.
If that is difficult, please consider these aspects when conducting business in the future.
Yes, we will immediately revise the notice to actively reflect your teacher's opinion.
Yes, thank you. Please be careful in the future.
Yes, I will continue to promote it from a gender equality perspective. Thank you.
Hello, I am counselor #@Affiliation# and #@Name#
How can I help you?
I wonder if the plan to distribute 10,000 micro electric vehicles is being implemented.
Thank you for your interest in developing the friendship business.
I will respond to your complaint.
Yeah how's it going
#@Affiliation# announced that it will replace 10,000 of its postal delivery two-wheeled vehicles with safe, ultra-compact electric vehicles.
However, a revised announcement was made at the April 19 pilot project briefing session.
Accordingly, as a pilot project, we have deployed 1,000 ultra-small electric vehicles since 19 years ago.
The ceiling is now set
We are working to resolve performance issues identified during the early stages of operation.
Considering the positive factors, we believe that continued introduction is necessary.
Yes, there are many good points.
We are currently checking the quality performance of new cars that were first equipped with airbags this year.
Repairs still take a long time due to high dependence on imported parts.
Considering this situation, there is a limit to increasing the scale immediately.
There are many difficulties in introduction
Yes, if you have any further questions, please contact #@affiliation#
Please contact us and we will be happy to assist you.

Hello, I have a question regarding the funeral expenses for civil servants.
What part of the death benefit are you curious about?
Can you check the payment scope or criteria?
I'll check it out. Please wait a moment.
Based on Article 43 of the Civil Servant Disaster Compensation Act and Article 54 of the Enforcement Decree
If a public official dies, twice the standard monthly income at the time is paid.
Is it double? But I don't think the amount is double.
If the standard monthly income exceeds 160 percent of the average standard monthly income
Only up to 160 percent is paid, so the amount will vary.
I guess that's why I see.
Thank you, counselor #@name#
Hello, this is counselor #@name#
What is your inquiry?
Yes, please provide hand wash in the Jeonju library bathroom.
Yes, I'm sorry you experienced a lot of inconvenience while using it.

Especially during the coronavirus pandemic
Yes, I apologize again for being a bit late.
We plan to inform you next week, but please understand that it may be slightly delayed depending on the circumstances.

Thank you for your interest in our Land, Infrastructure and Transport services.
We will review the inquiry you submitted through #@affiliation# and provide you with guidance.
Yes, that's right. I made an inquiry to #@Affiliation#
The gist is that it is a request for relief for the mental health facilities related to living accommodations.
Currently, our department is working to resolve the issue of residential-only accommodations.
We would like to inform you that we are preparing measures to distinguish between existing facilities and newly-built facilities.
Is that so? Are you making an effort?
In addition, please note that we will provide a grace period for administrative measures such as imposing enforcement fines.
Please understand that we cannot give you a specific answer as this is an internal matter under review.
It's difficult to give a specific answer.

We collect personal information to respond to your suggestions.
Yes, my name is #@name# and my number is #@phone number

Yes, sir. We will pass this on to the department in charge.
I will pass on the information and contact information that the teacher told me.
Please first proceed with a phone consultation, and if that does not resolve the issue, please visit us.

The park is currently promoting the idea of wearing masks, etc.
However, it seems that there are some areas that are not observed even with the above activities.

Hello, I have some questions regarding kindergarten tuition.
I would like to ask you more specific questions about kindergarten tuition.
The kindergarten tuition fee changes every year. Is there a rate of increase?
Kindergarten tuition increase rate, wait a minute
Is there something like the impression rate stipulated in the law?
The tuition fee must be increased in accordance with Article 25 of the Early Childhood Education Act.
It must not be higher than the average consumer price inflation rate of the preceding three years.
It means that it cannot unconditionally exceed the average consumer price inflation rate.
There are exceptional cases where it may exceed
In what case is that?
It can only be exceeded if it passes the review of the city/province early childhood education committee.
Okay, thanks for checking
Thank you, counselor #@name#

Yes, thank you for asking about the gym's business hours.
The gym is currently classified as a fitness facility in the indoor sports facility category.
Operations are currently restricted from 22:00 to 12:00 the next day.
It's until ten o'clock. Okay, I understand.
But can you please increase it a little?
Yes, industry-specific restrictions are regulations of the Central Disaster and Safety Countermeasures Headquarters.
Local governments across the country are implementing the same system.
Therefore, unfortunately, Gangneung City cannot modify it on its own.
Yes, I understand. Are there any other restrictions?
Yes, there are rules such as treadmill speed limits and shower room operation bans.
Yeah, I get it, but ten o'clock was too much

There are ashtrays on the sidewalk in my apartment complex.
Are you saying that ashtrays are installed in India?

Hello, I have something to ask you.
Yes, how may I help you?
Is there a need for security screening in railway areas?
Yes, I will answer your question.
Security checks in railway areas are very important
In overseas countries, terrorism continues to occur on railways and in public facilities.
To prevent domestic terrorism, we must also strengthen security screening.
Yes, I see. It was actually a bit annoying because of the security check.
I understand, but I ask for your understanding as this is an area where you need to cooperate.
Yes, I understand. That was very helpful.

I am a parent of a child who is a student at #@Elementary School in Dongjak-gu.
Yes, teacher, why did you call?
They unilaterally announced the school closure without considering the parents' opinions at all.
Is the school you mentioned #@affiliated#elementary school located in Dongjak-gu?

So where do our children study in the meantime?
#@Affiliation# Are you saying that you are against the middle school reconstruction?
What kind of innovation project is this? Isn't this the same as being designated as an innovation school?
Teacher, first of all, #@Elementary school is included in the school unit space innovation project.
It has been confirmed that this project is unrelated to the designation of the innovative school you mentioned.
Anyway, how do I file a petition to oppose the innovation project?
Then I will give you the contact information of the person in charge.
Please give me your contact information

Yes, hello, I want to know something
Yes, please tell me what your inquiry is.
What is the definition of a bird?
It refers to the periodic horizontal movement of sea water that occurs in conjunction with tidal phenomena.
Could you explain in more detail?

I need to scan something urgently. Is it possible to do it at the city hall?
Yes, you can scan it
Can I just go and do it?
A copier capable of scanning is located in the General Civil Service Office on the first floor of the City Hall.
I think you can scan it using the computer for civil complaints.

Hello, I am counselor #@Affiliation# and #@Name#
How can I help you?
I asked about the personnel cost ratio in the settlement statement of long-term care facilities for the elderly, and I would like to hear your response.
Yes, I will check and let you know.
Yes, please check slowly and guide me.
Yes, first of all, thank you for your interest in the elderly welfare policy.
I will provide guidance on the financial accounting rules you asked about.
The head of a long-term care facility has a notice regarding the standards for providing long-term care benefits and the method for calculating benefit costs.
The personnel expense ratio must be observed accordingly.
Is there such a notice?
Yes, the mayor of the city and county will provide guidance on punishment for long-term care facilities that violate the financial accounting standards for long-term care facilities.
These social welfare facilities are in the case of long-term home care facilities that you inquired about according to the Social Welfare Services Act.
You may receive administrative measures, etc. in accordance with the Long-Term Care Insurance for the Elderly Act.
Can you be more specific?
The authority to take administrative action against violations lies with the local government in charge.
For further details, please contact your city/county/district office.
It may vary depending on the local government.
For further inquiries, please contact #@affiliation#
Please contact us and we will be happy to assist you.
Thank you for your kind reply
Have a nice day, this was counselor #@name#
Hello, this is counselor #@name# from #@affiliation#
I'm calling to ask you some questions.
Yes, please tell me what your inquiry is.
I want to know what is provided by the Maritime Safety Information System
The items currently provided include seawater flow prediction and observation data, water depth, etc.
Is there anything else besides that?
There is also real-time observation data, navigation route, anchorage information, etc.
Is CCTV information not provided?
We provide video and photos from eleven CCTVs.
Yes, I understand. Thank you for your kind advice.
Yes, do you have any further questions?
No, not yet. If I have any further questions, I will contact you again.
Thank you #@Affiliation# #@Name#
Hello, I am counselor #@Affiliation# and #@Name#
How can I help you?
I have a question about the priority for apartment sales and rentals.
Yes, first of all, I will give you information on the first priority qualification for general supply of houses supplied in speculative overheated areas and subscription overheated areas.
The condition for applying for national housing is that you must have subscribed to the housing subscription savings plan and it has been two years since then.
You must pay the monthly installment at least twenty-four times on the agreed payment date each month.
Also, you must be the head of household.
All members of a household without a home must not have been the winners of another home within the past five years.
What happens to the public housing conditions, but what about private housing?
You must have been enrolled in the housing subscription savings plan for two years.
In addition, you must deposit an amount equivalent to the deposit standard amount of the asterisk.
Also, you must be the head of household.
You must not belong to a household that owns more than one house.
If this condition is met, will I be given first priority?
Yes, if you meet the above requirements, you can apply for first-priority subscription regardless of region.
I see. I guess I'll have to look into it myself.
Yes, if you have any further questions, please contact #@affiliation#
Please contact us and we will be happy to assist you.
Thank you for your kind reply
Have a nice day, this was counselor #@name#
Have a good day today #@Affiliation# #@Name#
Teacher, why are you calling?
Yes, hello, my child goes to #@school#
But these days, I rarely go to school to take classes.
No matter how severe the coronavirus is, isn't this a serious violation of the right to education?
Yes, teacher, you said #@affiliation#
You are saying that the right to learn is not guaranteed because classes are conducted remotely rather than in person.
Yes, it's really hard for my child because he can't go to school at all.
Yes, we fully understand what you said, teacher.
However, close contacts of confirmed cases at the school are continuously being identified.
So, currently, this week, the entire school year has switched to remote learning.
I know that. It came out in previous grades and the faculty came out too.
Yes, that's right. That's why #@affiliation# and #@affiliation# school came to an agreement.
Given the current situation, we are prioritizing the safety of our students.
So, I would appreciate it if you could understand that this is a measure taken.
Yes, I understand. I was contacting you because my child was having a hard time at home.
Yes, I fully understand your inconvenience. Do you have any other questions, sir?
No, I have no other questions.
Yes thank you have a nice day counselor #@name#
Hello, this is counselor #@name# from #@affiliation#
Hello, I have something to ask you.
Yes, how may I help you?
I was driving on the road today and I passed a tunnel.
The tunnel is very dark, making driving difficult.
Is there a reason to keep the tunnel dark?
Yes, first of all, I think you will experience a lot of inconvenience when using the tunnel.
There is a light meter installed at the entrance and exit.
Tunnel lighting is automatically adjusted based on measured values.
It automatically adjusts the brightness, but can't I make it a little brighter?
Sorry, all government offices are conserving energy.
Yes, that was very helpful. Thank you.
Thank you #@Affiliation# Counselor #@Name#
Hello, I am counselor #@Affiliation# and #@Name#
What brings you to my call?
Yes, hello #@Affiliation# I would like to make a suggestion regarding the establishment of a new middle school.
#@Address# You are suggesting a new construction within the public housing district.
Yes, that's right. This has been suggested several times.
But I feel like things are not progressing because I keep getting stuck somewhere.
Sorry for the inconvenience, sir.
As you said, there was a primary discussion in 2015.
At that time, it was decided to reexamine the relocation of nearby schools based on the opinions of the unit.
In the year 2019, we also promoted the establishment of a new middle school under the tentative name #@affiliation#
The Ministry of Education's review results showed that there was no demand for establishment, resulting in a negative notification.
Accordingly, it is actually difficult to promote new establishment.
We, #@affiliation#, are also reviewing various measures to resolve overcrowding.
Yeah, so realistically it's difficult now.
Yes, we will try to find a solution within the range that is as realistic as possible.
Okay, thanks for the answer. Thanks for your hard work.
Yes, do you have any other questions?
No, it's not an inquiry. There may be talk of establishing a new one later.
Please notify the residents at that time. We really want this to happen.
Yes, if the relevant matters are promoted, we will inform you in various ways. Thank you.
Hello, this is counselor #@name#
Yes, hello. I have something to ask you.
Yes, sir, do you have any questions?
#Address# to #@Affiliation# elementary school and #@Affiliation# middle school
I'm curious as to what the basis is for opposing non-voters in the redistribution vote.
Yes, first of all, thank you for your interest in Mars Osan Education.
Is what you said about the request to build a new school on the #@address# site?
Yes, that's right. It's a situation that all parents have suggested. What's the problem?
In cases such as the establishment of a school, it is difficult for #@affiliation# to make a decision on its own.
#@Affiliation# Must receive final approval from the central investment review committee of the organization
We are also discussing with relevant organizations from various angles at #@affiliation#
But, I suggested this because it was inconvenient for elementary school children to commute to school.
Yes, that's right. We have fully reviewed your complaint.
If not, can I help you connect you with the person in charge of #@affiliation#?
Please give me your contact information
Yes, I am the #@name# officer in charge of #@affiliation# organization #@affiliation#
My phone number is #@phone number#
I hope your complaint is resolved smoothly. Thank you.
Hello, this is counselor #@name# from #@affiliation#
Yes, thank you for your hard work. I just called to ask you a question.
Yes, can you tell me why?
I would like to know about the scope of the Pohang Port VTS Center control area
I will answer your question about the scope of the VTS Center control area.
Your voice is so kind. Please help me.
Thank you so much for the compliment. Please wait a moment.
The control area is within a six-mile radius from the anchorage within and outside the Pohang Port boundary.
Can I see a detailed map of the area?
If you want to see the control area at a glance, you can do so on the #@affiliation# homepage.
Oh, yes, I understand. Thank you for your kind advice.
Thank you #@Affiliation# #@Name#
Nice to meet you, this is #@Affiliation# Call Center #@Name# with the people.
What brings you here, sir?
Yes, I am currently working as an instructor at an academy.
But they say that starting this week, we won't be able to eat inside the school.
I apologize for the inconvenience. Teacher, you said you are currently a teacher at the academy.
Yes, we didn't stop eating during the coronavirus pandemic, so why are you suddenly doing this?
Yes, this is a measure in accordance with the social distancing level set by #@affiliation#
Eating is prohibited in academies and tutoring centers in the metropolitan area.
Then how long will it be banned?
As the metropolitan area is upgraded to Level 2, the measures will remain in place for the next three weeks.
However, this excludes those who operate courses that require more than eighty hours of instruction per month.
Dining is permitted if restaurant quarantine guidelines are followed.
If it's more than eighty hours a month, it's almost a full-time academy.
We are not a large academy, so I think it is unfair that only large academies are exempted.
We apologize for the inconvenience, but this is not something we can decide.
Please understand that this has been decided based on the government's quarantine measures.
Okay, I understand. I guess I'll have to post something on #@National Newspaper Library#. Thank you for your hard work.
Yes, I'm sorry I couldn't give you a satisfactory answer. This was counselor #@name#.
I am #@Affiliation# counselor #@Name# who brings happiness.
Hello, I'm planning to move to the #@address# apartment.
Yes sir, what is your problem?
I found out that the #@address# apartment has two assigned schools.
#@Other# School and #@Other# School came out
But it's too difficult to commute from #@address# to #@other# school
Yes, this is an inquiry regarding elementary school assignments.
I will check and inform you. Please wait a moment.
Yes, please check.
Yes, customer, I checked with #@affiliation#.
The two schools in the area you inquired about are confirmed to be in a shared school district.
So does that mean the kids have to go to school like that?
It seems that commuting to school won't be difficult since it's a shared school zone
Where can I direct further inquiries regarding assignments later?
#@Affiliation# is the person in charge of #@Name#
Please contact our direct number #@phone number#
Yes, I understand. Thank you.
I hope you have a nice afternoon, this is counselor #@name#
Hello, this is #@Affiliation# #@Name#
Are schools and tutoring centers required to have insurance?
Nice to meet you. I will answer your inquiry.
In relation to operations, you must subscribe to insurance or mutual aid programs.
Do I have to pay compensation if a problem occurs to a student?
Provides compensation in case of damage to life or body
How do I manage my insurance subscription documents?
Must be submitted to the jurisdiction #@affiliation# within fourteen days from the date of registration
Can I do the same thing when renewing or changing?
Yes, that's right. It's the same when renewing or changing.
Thanks for letting me know, it was helpful
Thank you #@Affiliation# #@Name#
Hello, this is counselor #@name#
Thank you for your hard work. I have a complaint.
Yes, teacher, what is your complaint?
They say that Cheongna Medical Complex Town is run by #@affiliated# hospital
#@Affiliation# has great distrust in its financial stability and business capabilities.
Yes, I see. What is the problem?
Yes, so I think #@affiliation# hospital is correct
I'm curious as to how the current progress is planned.
Yes, sir, is this the Cheongna Medical Complex Town in Incheon?
Yes, it's Seo-gu, Incheon Metropolitan City.
Regarding the current evaluation of the Cheongna Medical Complex Town contest
We plan to proceed fairly according to the evaluation criteria of the contest guidelines.
So I don't think you need to worry too much.
Can you tell me more? I'm very anxious.
If so, I will direct you to the person in charge.
#@Affiliation# Organization #@Affiliation# #@Name# I am the person in charge
My contact number is #@phone number#
I hope your work goes smoothly. Thank you.
Hello, this is #@Affiliation# #@Name#
There aren't enough desks for elective mobile classes, so I can't sit and listen to the class.
I will ask your school principal to find out the situation.
I think we should guarantee maximum freedom of subject choice.
I will try to give you four subject choices.
It would be right to place desks considering the number of students in the mobile class.
I will double check to see if there are any classrooms that are lacking.
Where can I inquire if I have any inconveniences at school in the future?
First of all, I think discussing it with your homeroom teacher is an effective way to resolve the issue.
I hope that the inconvenience will be resolved quickly and that you will have a happy school life.
Please help improve your children's learning.
Yes, I understand. My name is #@Affiliation# #@Name#
Hello, this is counselor #@name# from #@affiliation#
Yes, thank you for your hard work. I just called to ask you a question.
Yes, please tell me what your inquiry is.
What is Sea Road View?
Provides panoramic images of the sea area, including the entrances and exits of major ports
Any other information?
Provides tide and current forecast information as well as weather information and past accident history.
Where do you use this information?
It is useful in various marine industry fields such as yacht, marine tourism, and port operation.
Oh, yes, I understand. Thank you for your kind advice.
Yes, do you have any further questions?
No, not yet. If I have any further questions, I will contact you again.
Thank you #@Affiliation# #@Name#
Hello, I am counselor #@Affiliation# and #@Name#
How can I help you?
I'd like to make a suggestion.
Regarding the construction plan for the undersea tunnel of the Jeil Expressway
Yes, I have checked the details you requested.
I will tell you about the case of National Route 77 connecting Daecheon Port in Boryeong, South Chungcheong Province and Anmyeondo in Taean.
Yes, please answer.
It was cheaper and more economical to build an undersea tunnel than to connect Wonsando and Daecheon Port with a bridge.
However, in terms of road function and economic feasibility, it was necessary to connect to Incheon Bridge.
It needs to be connected to Incheon Bridge
Yes, the underground connection to Incheon Bridge was impossible.
We would like to inform you that it is difficult to bury the building as we believe that the resulting loss will be greater.
That was something that was considered before.
Yes, is this a satisfactory answer?
For further inquiries, please contact #@affiliation#
Please contact us and we will be happy to assist you.
Thank you for your kind reply
Have a nice day, this was counselor #@name#
Nice to meet you. How may I help you?
I'd like to report that truck for violating the lane regulations.
Would you like to report a traffic violation?
I sent you the video, so please check it.
After reviewing the video footage you provided, we understand that it was a designated lane operation on the highway.
The reported vehicle falls under Article 60, Paragraph 1 of the Road Traffic Act, which stipulates that it must drive on a designated lane on a highway.
Okay, then how do you handle it?
We plan to send a request for confirmation of violation to the vehicle owner's address.
After notifying the violation upon attendance, a fine will be imposed.
Okay, please handle it that way.
Thank you for reporting this in person despite your busy schedule.
Also, the risk of an accident must be sufficiently explained to the violator.
We will help you recognize the risks of violations and drive safely.
I would appreciate it if you could do that.
Yes, if you have any questions, please contact me and I will give you detailed information.
Hello, this is counselor #@name# from #@affiliation#
Yes, thank you for your hard work. I just called to ask you a question.
Yes, please tell me what your inquiry is.
Are there any marine debris collection and cleanup activities?
It is mainly implemented in coastal areas where access by ships or purification equipment is difficult.
So, are you carrying out purification activities regularly?
It is conducted once a month.
In addition, we conduct a preliminary survey every quarter and conduct it jointly with relevant organizations.
Yes, I understand. Thank you for your kind advice.
Yes, do you have any further questions?
No, not yet. If I have any further questions, I will contact you again.
Thank you #@Affiliation# #@Name#
Good day, this is counselor #@name#
Yes, hello. I have something to ask you.
Yes, sir, do you have any questions?
There is a metropolitan area express railway C line, right?
#@Other# I wonder if there are any plans to extend the station
Yes, I will tell you about the additional stop plan at #@Other# stations.
Assuming that the cause is responsible for all additional operating costs
We plan to first review the validity, etc.
I want to hear more details, but I can't get through to the person in charge.
Then I will help you connect with the person in charge. Can you take a note?
Yes, please tell me
#@Affiliation# The person in charge is #@Name#
Please contact us at #@phone number#
Good day, this is counselor #@name#
Yes, thank you. I hope your complaint is processed well.
Hello, this is #@affiliation# call center that brings you happiness.
The call was long and the connection was delayed. How can I help you?
Yes, my child graduated this time and I received a graduation album.
But I think there's a problem because the graduation album smells so bad.
Sorry for the inconvenience. Have you asked the school about it?
Yes, I already told you because the smell was so bad from the day I got it.
At first he didn't admit it, but when I gave him the album, he admitted it.
So did you request something like a safety inspection in relation to that?
Yes, my principal said that if you feel uneasy, you should get tested.
So, you sent a certified letter to the company and received the relevant documents.
You received documents related to the hazardous material inspection from the company.
I didn't receive it directly, I think it was sent to the school.
But they said that the documents were from three years ago when they were inspected and that there was nothing wrong with them.
Of course, there wasn't anything wrong with it back then, but a lot of time has already passed.
The school says it's not a big problem and they'll wrap it up.
I felt like I had to file a complaint because I didn't understand it at all.
First, we will forward the relevant information to the department in charge.
Could you please tell me your name and contact information?
Yes, my name is #@name# and please contact me at #@phone#
Yes, I will pass it on so that I can contact you right away. Thank you.
Hello, this is counselor #@name#
Yes, there was a confirmed case of coronavirus at my child's school.
Yes, sir, have you disinfected the school?
Yes, we did, but anyway, there were confirmed cases.
But is it okay for students from other grades to attend in-person classes?
We will respond in accordance with the basic quarantine measures for schools related to COVID-19.
If a confirmed case occurs, all students and faculty will be sent home.
We are switching to online remote classes.
Yes, that's why I'm asking why you make me go to school.
However, if in-person classes are possible based on the results of the epidemiological investigation,
Students and faculty, excluding confirmed patients and those in contact, are attending school.
Is that okay? Is it safe?
Yes, I fully understand your concern.
Complete disinfection and systematic epidemiological investigation are being carried out.
This is the part where attendance is decided based on the results.
Well, I think I should talk to my #@affiliated#organization
Yes, sir. Then, may I help you by guiding you to the relevant department?
Yes, please tell me where it is.
#@Affiliation# Organization #@Affiliation# Department
I'll call you.

Hello, this is counselor #@name#
#@Affiliation#Regarding the selection of the middle school as a Green Smart Future School
Please continue speaking, sir.
I don't think the Board of Education should do this without sufficient consultation with parents.
Are you saying that you are against the selection of Green Smart Future School?
That's right, this is called a future school, but isn't it actually trying to change it into an innovation school?
Please wait a moment. I will check what you said.
Seoul City #@Affiliation#Middle School, right?
Yes, that's right #@affiliation#middle school
First, let me tell you about the Green Smart Future School project.
The selection was based on criteria for old buildings that are over 40 years old.
This is a project aimed at creating an environment through the participation of school members.
By the way, why don't you listen to the parents' opinions?
Sir, I will give you the number of the person in charge of this matter.
Who is the person in charge?
#@Affiliation# and #@Name# are the orderers
My contact number is #@phone number#. You can call me and make inquiries.
Okay, I'll call the person in charge of ordering.
Hello, I am #@Affiliation#, petitioner #@Name#
I would like to make a complaint
Yes, please tell me what it is about.
It's so inconvenient to use the Wirye-Hanam area bus.
Please install some new buses or increase the number of buses.
Yes, we have received your request for bus improvement.
First of all, I apologize for any inconvenience caused by using the bus.
Our city's bus routes are operated under a private system in which transportation operators apply for changes to their business plans.
Yes, but I would still like to ask you to accept it.
Please contact us anytime for further inquiries
Thank you #@Affiliation# #@Name#
Hello, this is counselor #@name#
Hello, I would like to ask about the school store.
What is the specific content related to the store?
What foods are prohibited from being sold in school cafeterias?
I'll check it out, just a moment
First of all, we are following the Special Act on Children's Food Safety Management.
High-calorie, low-nutrient foods and high-caffeine foods are prohibited.
What is it specifically?
High-calorie, low-nutrient foods are usually fast foods or instant foods.
Hamburgers, pizza, donuts, ramen, things like that?
Yes, and there are also other things that are not suitable for students' health or nutrition.
Sales may be restricted if designated by the school principal.
You're saying that sales can be restricted at the discretion of the school principal?
Yes, teacher, it's up to the principal's discretion.
Okay, I understand. Thank you.
Thank you, counselor #@name#
This is #@Name#, a counselor with the people.
Hello, I am an agent for foreign business.
Yes, teacher, what is your question?
I had a hard time communicating in English with the people working at the immigration office.
Foreigners living in Korea have no communication at all when filing a complaint.
Even foreigners from non-English speaking countries speak English.
Teacher, first of all, I apologize for the inconvenience.
Are you requesting the placement of English-speaking staff for the convenience of foreigners?
Yes, that's right. If there's even one person, it would be easier to process the complaint.
As you suggested, we are also hiring skilled workers.
It is difficult to allocate sufficient personnel to each office.

Yes, I understand what you mean.
First, you can consult in various languages by calling #@number# without the area code.
The call center can handle business in the complainant's native language.
We will also strive to enhance our employees’ foreign language skills.
Yes, I understand. I guess I'll have to use the call center from now on.
Yes, thank you. Do you have any other questions?
No, it's okay. There isn't any.
Have a nice afternoon, this was counselor #@name#
Hello, I am counselor #@Affiliation# and #@Name#
How can I help you?
I stole something from my friend's father with my friend. How will I be punished?
It is understood that this is a punishment for theft of family belongings of four accomplices.
Yes, that's right, the accomplice's family.
The son and his friend committed theft together, so the crime of special theft is established.
However, unlike his friend, the son is exempt from the penalty as he is subject to the rite of kinship.
Am I the only one charged with special theft?
Yes, that's right. My son is exempted from the kinship rites of passage under Article 344 and Article 328 of the Criminal Act.
This may vary depending on the specific individual case.
Okay, I understand

How can I help you?
I suggested improving the distribution criteria for special housing supply for the disabled. What happened?
Thank you for your usual interest in the Land, Infrastructure and Transport Administration.
We have confirmed your inquiry regarding housing subscription and supply rules.
Yeah, that's right. How did that go?
In the case of special supply for the disabled, the rules on housing supply apply.
There are rules for housing supply managed by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport through institutional recommendations.
Here, only the basic qualification requirements for institutional recommendations are set.
Detailed selection criteria are delegated to the recommending agency.
I see. The criteria will vary depending on the recommending agency.
Since everyone's criteria are different, please contact the relevant recommendation agency.
Okay, I understand. I'll ask them.

Hello, I would like to file a petition to increase the number of national kindergartens.
You're saying that you want to increase the number of national kindergartens?
Yes, I am currently working as a special education teacher at a kindergarten.
I think we need to increase the number of national kindergartens and increase the number of teachers.
Please also request additional kindergarten teachers.
Yes, there are too many children for one teacher to look after these days.
Is the kindergarten you are currently working at located in Gwangju Metropolitan City?
Yes, but I think it needs to be expanded nationwide, not just in Gwangju.
Teacher, first, let me tell you about the current situation in Gwangju.
On August 12th, a while ago, we announced the number of kindergarten teachers to be selected.
I saw that too, but it seemed like there were too few people.
The number of people is reflected in the number of people notified by the Ministry of Education to the city/provincial office of education.
If you have any further questions, I will give you the number of the person in charge.
Then please tell me the number of the person in charge.

Yes, I would like to file a complaint about the Hanam Wirye New Town bus.
Yes, please tell me about the Wiryeseong District bus complaint.
With the opening of this #@address# station, it seems like there will be a need for bus route connections with other cities.
Yes, you requested improvement of the bus route.
Currently, Songpa-gu, Seongnam-si, and Woori-si are located in Wiryeseong-gu.
Accordingly, we are working to connect routes by local government as much as possible.
Yes, the Florichewi bus stop is really crowded.
There is also corona now, so improvement is needed.
Among the bus stops in the Wiryeseong district, the Floriche Wiryeseong bus stop is the most used.
That's why we're expanding and replacing the facility.
Additionally, we will minimize inconvenience in using route buses through route-specific monitoring.
Yes, thank you.

I would like to inquire about the criteria for establishing a reading room.
Could you tell me the criteria for establishing a reading room?
Is it possible to set up a reading room on the upper floor of a coin karaoke room?
I will check for you.
First of all, if there is a facility that falls under the Educational Environment Protection Act,
It has been confirmed that the establishment of a reading room is impossible.
Is it impossible even if it's not the floor right above?
It is not possible if it is on the same floor or the floor directly above or below within 20 meters.
Are there any other requirements besides that?
The building's intended use must be a neighborhood living facility or an educational research facility.
Toilets must be separated into men's and women's areas and have at least one toilet.
Are there any regulations regarding reading rooms?
The total area of the reading room interview must be at least 100 square meters.

Yes, thank you for your hard work. I just called to ask you a question.
Yes, please tell me what your inquiry is.
What is the definition of tide?
Tides are regular rises or falls in sea level.
It is a phenomenon caused by the universal gravitational force between the moon, the sun, and the earth.
Could you explain in more detail?
The highest sea level is called high tide.
Conversely, the lowest state is called low tone.
Oh, yes, I understand. Thank you for your kind advice.
Yes, do you have any further questions?
No, not yet. If I have any further questions, I will contact you again.

I would like to ask some questions about special sports students.
What exactly are you talking about?
My son is in the fifth grade of elementary school and he wants to be a gymnastics specialist.
In order to receive training, I only went to class once every day during this semester and left school early.
During this semester, I only go to class once a day and then leave early.
Yes, in this case, I wonder if it is possible to complete the fifth year.
Just a moment, I'll check.
The school wants to offer supplementary lessons, but our schedules don't work out.
The number of attendance days required to complete each grade course is at least two-thirds of the number of class days.
Then does that mean I can't complete it?
No, leaving early after class is possible because it counts as attendance days.
Are you saying that it is possible to complete the fifth grade?
Yes, it is confirmed to be possible.
Okay, thanks for checking

Yes, where should I report if I witness corruption by a public official?
Are you talking about reporting absurdity?
When you witness a public official committing an absurdity
When a public official demands money or entertainment, etc.
If you find out that someone around you has provided you with money or other valuables
You can report by phone or through the Internet homepage.
Then what about phone numbers and things like that?
I'll give you my phone number. It's #@phone number#. Please report it here.

Hello, what are you curious about?
I would like to inquire about punishment for improper solicitation.
Could you please tell me what the case is?
The principal received an improper request and gave instructions to the homeroom teacher.
Will the homeroom teacher be punished if he or she fails to perform his or her duties?
I think you asked about whether it is subject to punishment.
Yes, that's right. Does the homeroom teacher get punished?
The principal, who is a superior, gives instructions based on the request for illicit favors.
Since you have performed your duties, you are subject to criminal punishment.
First of all, the principal will be punished, and so will the homeroom teacher.
The homeroom teacher knew that he was following through on an improper request for a third party.
Because I performed my duties as instructed without expressing any intention to refuse.
Likewise, it is subject to criminal punishment.
So in this case, both people are subject to punishment.
Yes, if you have any further questions, please contact us and we will be happy to assist you.

Nice to meet you. This is #@affiliation#, bringing you happiness. How may I help you?
Yes, thank you for your hard work. I have been treated so unfairly.
I'm contacting you because I feel so depressed and I wonder if there's a solution.
Yes, sir, can you tell me more about what you do?
My child was bullied at school a few days ago. There were quite a few people who witnessed it.
I want to punish him somehow.
The school wants to continue to resolve the issue on its own with the principal's authority.
The people who should be protecting the students are actually protecting the perpetrators.
I feel so wronged, so I wonder if the school principal can resolve this on his own.
I know you must have been very frustrated, but I will check with the school principal to see if there are any self-resolving requirements.
Yes, please, please. They are trying to force it even though we don't want it.
Yes, thank you for waiting. I checked the related information.
It says that the victimized student and their guardian do not want the deliberation committee to be held.
Right now, the teacher wants to hold a deliberation committee meeting.
That is why you can request the holding of a deliberation committee as a priority.
Okay, I understand. I'll have to speak out strongly to the school.
I'm glad you got my answer.
Thank you for your reply. Thanks for your hard work.
Yes, I hope it gets resolved smoothly. #@Name#

I would like to inquire about the repeal of the trailer promotion law.
First of all, thank you for your interest in #@affiliation#work
We have confirmed that your inquiry is about agricultural trailers.
Yes, that's right, it's an agricultural trailer.
In the case of agricultural trailers, there are cases where machines subject to mandatory inspection are sold and distributed without inspection.
In this case, a fine of less than 10 million won is imposed by #@affiliation#.
Is that how it's going?
Yes, the agricultural trailers you inquired about have received nine inspections.
In addition, it appears that the possibility of compensation for damages related to the agricultural machinery inspection system is a matter for the judiciary to decide.
It's not something that the administrative agency is responsible for.
Yes, is this a satisfactory answer?

I would like to talk about improving the books used in kindergarten.
Yes, nice to meet you. What improvements would you like to talk about?
I would like to completely replace paper books with digital books.
Kids love a variety of digital books with flashy movements.
Early childhood is a very important period that determines the quality of life.
It is better to grow up reading picture books during this period.
Aren't various stimuli better for children?
Digital books and paper books each have their own pros and cons.
When looking at the developmental stages of infants, direct experience is important.
These days, children have many experiences other than paper books.
Yes, I understand what you are saying.
However, until the age of six, picture books made of paper are effective.
Please understand that we cannot provide guidance on the content you suggested.

#@Does your department have a safety inspection plan for school facilities?
Yes, are you asking about safety inspections of school facilities in preparation for natural disasters during the thawing season?
The seasons have changed and the facilities have been idle for a while due to vacation.
Yes, information related to safety inspections is provided on the #@affiliation# website.
We are providing information on the plans and results for each inspection period in the disaster safety management data room on our website.
I think it would be good to refer to the contents of the related post.
So is there anything about school there?
It is difficult to provide detailed information about the teacher's post here.
Then, would you please connect me to the department in charge of the relevant work?

Hello, I am Citizen's Guide #@Affiliation# #@Name#
Yes, thank you for your hard work. I called to ask you something.
Yes, teacher, what is the reason you are calling?
My child is currently taking special after-school classes.
But no matter how I think about it, I think the tuition fee is set too high.
Are you inquiring about after-school class instructor fees for special classes in your district?
Isn't there a specific amount set in the instructor fee payment regulations?
External lecturers are said to be within 40,000 won or something like that.
I'm sorry, teacher, but I checked the related operational support plan.
The specific amount is not specified, but the instructor fee is to be kept reasonable.
Then where is that appropriate maintenance determined?
That part is subject to review by the school management committee.
It is determined by considering the number of hours the program is operated and the program content.
Anyway, what I'm saying is that it's decided in advance.
But how is it that the parents' position is not considered at all?
Does it make sense for public education institutions to demand an amount that is almost equivalent to private education?
I will upload this part to the National Petition and file a complaint.
I'm really sorry for the inconvenience. Do you have any other questions?
Yes, even if I talk about it, it won't be reflected, so what are you going to talk about? Thank you for your hard work.

Yes, thank you for your hard work. I called you about your child's school vacation and graduation.
Yes, can you elaborate?
This time, I was notified of the vacation schedule and graduation date.
No matter how much I think about it, I can't understand it.
I'm trying to gather opinions from parents and suggest changes.
Is there any way to change it?
Yes, first of all, school holidays are guaranteed by the Enforcement Decree of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.
Before each school year begins, #@affiliation# will have been reviewed.
So, it is difficult to change in the middle.
So, is it impossible to change the vacation or graduation date for this semester?
Yes, the #@affiliation# deliberation is held at the beginning of the year.
I think you should attend then or submit your opinion in writing.
No matter how much I think about it, I can't understand it logically.
Okay, I understand. I'll have to talk to the school again.

We are currently negotiating with the transportation company to change the route from Songpa-daero to Wirye-daero and go directly to Namwirye Station.

Hello, I would like to inquire about school violence.
Yes, what specifically are you curious about?
I understand that we need to form some kind of committee to handle this.
Are you talking about the school violence deliberation committee?
But is it possible for the school principal to resolve the issue without forming a committee?
I will check it for you. Please wait a moment.
Teacher, first of all, the victimized students and their guardians do not want to form a deliberation committee.
If certain requirements are met, the school principal can resolve the issue on his/her own.
Can you tell me what the specific requirements are?
If you do not have a medical certificate that requires physical or mental treatment for more than this week,
The second is when there is no property damage or it is immediately restored.
The third is when the violence is not continuous.
In cases where it is not retaliation for reporting school violence, providing statement materials, etc.
There are four requirements in total:

Hello, I'm curious about the quarantine standards in schools.
What exactly are you curious about?
How many times a year is the school disinfected?
In the case of regular disinfection within the school, it is mandatory to carry out it five times a year.
Is it mandatory to do it only five times a year?
No, it's a little different depending on the time period.
From April to September, it must be done at least once a month.
Then what about the rest of the months?
From October to March, you can do it at least once every three months.
So, even in this time of year, it only happens five times a year?
Five times is the mandatory number
If there is an outbreak of infectious disease in the school, additional measures are recommended.

Are you talking about the Sangsahwa planting area?
Yes, that's right. Can you stop planting flowers there?
Please also take down the fence.
It is a resting space for citizens, but the space to rest is gradually decreasing.
First of all, thank you for your interest in park administration.
The soil in the shade area of the park is being compacted, which is hindering the growth of trees.
So, we were planting sagebrush to protect the trees and improve the landscape.
Yeah I know that, but it's a little uncomfortable
There are currently many opinions requesting the preservation of the shade, so we are reviewing the adjustment.

Hello, I have something to ask you.
What part are you inquiring about?
For students who are minors
Is it also subject to sanctions if you ask a teacher for a favor?
Do you think the case you mentioned is an improper request for a minor child?
Yes, in that case, is it subject to sanctions?
Even in that case, the effect of that is
Because it belongs to minor children
It is considered as an improper request for a third party.
Even in that case, is it subject to sanctions?
Yes, it is applicable and therefore subject to sanctions.

Hello, this is counselor #@Affiliation#, #@Name#
Do you have any questions?
Yes, this is #@affiliation#
Could you please get rid of the flower bed in front of here?
Yes, I will respond to your request to remove the flower bed.
Currently, #@Affiliation# has no plans to demolish the flower bed.

Hello, how may I help you?
Yes, I have a question regarding your request for bribery.
What part are you inquiring about?
It is an improper request through a third party.
Will there be sanctions if it is not delivered to public officials performing their duties?
Article 5, Paragraph 1 of the Act, Any person, directly or through a third party
It is stipulated that public officials, etc. must not be asked for improper favors.
Yes, the part I'm curious about is the case where it wasn't conveyed.
In cases where the request for improper favors is not delivered to public officials performing their duties,
It is not subject to sanctions in itself.
Then it says so in the law
The law regarding the part you asked about is yes
I understand that if it is not delivered, there will be no sanctions.
For further inquiries, please contact #@phone number# Thank you

Yes, I am a parent raising a child at #@address#.
My child is currently attending #@school#, and there is an incinerator nearby.
Yes, sir, is this inquiry related to noise from the incinerator?
No, that's not it. I know that the school is an educational environment protection zone.
I was wondering if it is against the law to have an incinerator nearby.
Is the law you are referring to the law on protection of educational environment?
Yes, other parents say this too, so this needs to be improved.
Yes, as you said, many parents contact us.
So I checked the laws on protecting the educational environment.
It is stipulated that the straight-line distance is within a range of two hundred meters from the school boundary, etc.
However, it says that the facility is not located within the educational environment protection zone.
Then it's two hundred meters away in a straight line.
It just seemed too close to see with the naked eye.
Yes, many people filed complaints, so we visited the site ourselves.
Even though you did the actual investigation, it doesn't apply.
Okay, I understand for now. We'll have to discuss further what to do in the future.

Please find out the bus from Bongam-ri to Gongju.
Yes, let's go to Bongam-ri and find out.
If you're going to Gongju, you have to take a bus from Jochiwon or Daejeon.
Teacher, if that's the case, take bus number 500 from Bongam-ri stop.
Then, you can get off at the Singandong Terminal stop.
Then what time is it?
Yes, I'm sorry, but it's difficult for us to confirm the bus schedule.
I will check with the 500th bus company and inform you.
The 500 bus is confirmed to be Gongju Citizen Transportation.
I'll give you the phone number. Can you make a note of it?
I can't do it, so please take a picture.
Yes, teacher, I need your consent to use your personal information when sending text messages. Do you agree?
Yes, please do that. I need to receive it by text.

Then please check with #@address#
Yes, I will check and let you know.
Teacher, it is difficult for us to confirm the exact details.

Can you tell me the number of the bus company number 46?
Please text me the number
I will send a text message with the representative number #@affiliation# to the phone number you gave me.
Yes, thank you. Thank you for your hard work.
Nice to meet you, this is #@affiliation#. Can I take a quick survey?
Yes, you can. Please tell me.
Have you ever had any inconveniences or too many documents when handling civil affairs?
I don't know about that because I'm an employee.
Have you experienced any inconvenience in handling civil affairs?
If you divide the field into several categories, I don't think there will be a need for a satisfaction survey.
Yes sir, I understand
Can I check the box to decline the satisfaction survey if I feel uncomfortable?
No, teacher, when you say it like that, I think it's a bit funny.
There is no need to improve, and I think that from the teacher's perspective, he is just talking nonsense.
This is a rejection, this is the end of it.
I understand, but we are conducting a survey on customer satisfaction.
Just about the civil complaint handling part. Then there's none. I'll do it next time.
Yes, thank you teacher #@affiliation#
Nice to meet you, this is #@affiliation@. How may I help you?

I got a tax deduction for my car, but now I'm being asked to pay a surtax. What should I do?
Would you like me to connect you with someone in charge regarding taxes?
No, I'm not looking for a tax agent right now.
Even if you receive a tax reduction in your current situation, you still have to pay taxes if you buy another car.
But why are you collecting the fine? That's what I'm saying.
The wiretapping department does not handle vehicle registration separately.
So I have a hard time confirming the exact person in charge. Could you please wait a moment?
I will contact you after checking with a similar person in charge. Thank you for waiting.
It is difficult to confirm the person in charge of the vehicle registration, sir.
There is no person in charge of vehicle registration
I will contact the person in charge of assigning and issuing vehicle registration numbers.
I will tell you about the teacher's work and connect you if possible.
Could you please wait a moment?
Please check the example and tell me clearly.

If it's okay, I'd like to hear from you again next week.

It is difficult for us to confirm the exact person in charge regarding the water park.
Okay, then I think you just need to go to the beach
Yes, I will pass this information on to the relevant department. Thank you.
Please take care of your health in this hot weather.

Then what time is the last train?
Let's check the last train time. The last train is at 6:48 p.m.

I'm sorry, teacher. Could you please say that again?
Is there a bus route from Eumseong Terminal to Jincheon Terminal?

Hello, this is #@affiliation#. I am contacting you regarding the survey.
I'm busy right now, should I do it or not?
Yes, teacher. Then can I say that you refused to take the survey?
No, I didn't give a precise answer, so that won't work.
Teacher, I think I chose the wrong word. I apologize for the inconvenience.
No, this isn't a rejection.
Yes, I will list down the many inconveniences that the teacher found institutionally inconvenient.
Yes, I'm not sure if this will be reflected or not, but this is something that happened on the ground.
I heard that teacher processed the documents at the wiretapping office. Yes, he did.
And if you just accept it, it's fine, so there's no need to feel uncomfortable.
Yes, that's right, teacher.
If it has nothing to do with us, we will exclude it. Then there is no need to investigate.
Teacher, I think there was a misunderstanding
In the civil affairs department, I was well aware of the part about disposing of herbal medicines.
I will write down what you said in terms of improvement.
I don't think it needs to be treated the same as Western medicine institutionally.
Yes, I understand. I have written that part down. Do you have any other opinions?
Yeah, I can't think of anything else. Thanks for your hard work.
Yes thank you I was #@affiliation#

To the person in charge of management there
I called to suggest this fact.
Teacher, which way should I connect you?
I called the cotton mill and the county office.
On the cotton side, they said that the management is done by the military.
I'm sure you were very inconvenienced.
I spoke to a person called a chief in the military, but he didn't even look at the scene.
He answered from the perspective of those people.
You spoke to the military chief.
Even though it rained and the salinity of the sea dropped, I sprinkled clams there.
He made excuses like this, saying that some clams are dead and some are alive.
There were a lot of dead clams because the salinity of the sea dropped due to the rain.
So when I go down that much, until the salinity goes up
I told him he had to stop temporarily, but he wouldn't listen.
I will check the part you asked about again and then give you an answer.
Since I've said this much, please give me your phone number so I can call the person in charge.
Okay, the person in charge of the fishing village experience village has been confirmed in the Fisheries Industry Division.

Yes, I run a dog cafe at #@address#
We have two dogs in our cafe and I can't contact them right now.
Teacher, where did you put the two puppies?
The guest entrusted me with hotel management.
He sent me a text message out of the blue asking me to raise him.
And now I haven't been able to contact you for two days.
When I reported it to the police, they gave me this number.
So, the teacher is currently running a dog cafe.
Are you saying that another customer left two dogs in the cafe?
Yes, that's right. I left it there and can't contact you.
I will guide you after confirming the institution you can inquire about.
Yes, I will wait for your guidance.
Nice to meet you, this is #@Affiliation#. How may I help you?
The stream in our neighborhood overflowed and many cars were submerged.
The stream overflowed and many cars were submerged.
Yes, that caused unexpected repair costs.
I called Cheonan City Hall, Mokcheon-eup, Songmyeong-dong, and all the jurisdictions there.
But since there is no way to get help, I'm going to file a complaint with the wiretapping department.
You said there was no relief in your jurisdiction.
I have unexpected repair costs and I want to resolve them with the insurance company.
Insurance companies have tried everything. Insurance companies can only rescue your own cars.
It seems that only insured vehicles are covered by the insurance.
It's not #@affiliation#, but it's #@address# in Cheongyong-dong, Cheonan, in the jurisdiction area.
They say that if you exchange your car within two years, you will be exempt from the registration tax.
But since I have a compact car, of course there is no registration tax.
Yes, your car is exempt from registration tax.
Well, it's just a show, but there's no way to get relief for unexpected expenses anyway.
Yes, teacher, it must have been very uncomfortable.
Yes, and then they raised the road behind the Jogeop-myeon complex in Naecheon and did something.
At the end of the year, we will lay down the board blocks in front of Cheonan City Hall Station, Cheonan City Cheonan Station Branch.
Yes, sir. Then, can I connect you after checking the jurisdiction?
Yes, I would like to know the jurisdiction.
Thank you for waiting. Please call when you are connected. Thank you.
Yes, you've worked hard. Thank you for your hard work.
Hello, this is #@affiliation#. I am contacting you regarding the survey.
Do you have any suggestions for the process of receiving and processing civil complaints in the city?
We are conducting a satisfaction survey for complainants to hear their opinions and make improvements.
I called you because I confirmed the route you used for wiretapping.
Can I talk to you for a moment?
Yes, please do it now.
Thank you all, I have three questions
Four questions, how long will it take?
Yes, it will take about three or four minutes.
Have you experienced any inconveniences or have any areas that need improvement while handling civil affairs?
I can't suddenly remember what I need to improve on because it's been so long.
The civil society said that my civil society documents were too complicated.
Are you talking about the documents of a private organization?
Yes, the point is that I think the government should make demands on private organizations.
It's a shame that the government has been turned around from what a private organization should be demanding.
The government should make a request to the private sector, but the private sector makes a request to the government.
Yes, I think you can just write that part down.
Okay, I understand. I will write it down.
Yes, thank you. Thank you for your hard work.
Hello, this is #@affiliation#. I am contacting you regarding the survey.
Yes, I did a survey last time and I felt bad.
Could you tell me about the survey?
I told you what was wrong with the system, but you left that out and said this, so I
Yes, teacher, I am truly sorry for the inconvenience.
It's inconvenient because it's institutionally wrong
Yes, I will write down the areas that need improvement that the teacher mentioned.
And I have two more questions, is that okay, sir?
Yes, it's okay. Go ahead.
Teacher, what was the attitude of the civil servant in charge of civil affairs?
Where do you think you fall between kind, average, and unkind?
That was okay, average
Yes, sir, was it normal? I have one more question.
Satisfaction: Very satisfied, teacher, were you satisfied? Average?
Yeah this was just normal too
Yes, teacher. I will try to help you with any inconveniences you may have.
I apologize again for the inconvenience and please take care of your health in this hot weather.
Nice to meet you, this is #@affiliation@. How may I help you?
Yes, there is a beach called #@address# here in Taean.
Yes, I called from #@address# beach.
Yes, could you please check if there is a Chinese restaurant around the resort at the beach?
Could you tell me about the area around the resort one more time?
Yes, there are Chinese restaurants around the resort.
Yes, sir, is this a Chinese restaurant?
Yes, I'm talking about the jajangmyeon restaurant.
Yes, I will check the Internet and give you directions. Could you please wait a moment?
Yes, please check slowly
Thank you for waiting
It is difficult to find a Chinese restaurant in Sindori around the area #@address# right now.
Yeah, there's no jajangmyeon restaurant around here.
Yes, I can confirm that there is a Chinese restaurant nearby. It's on this side of #@Address#
Will delivery be available there?
I'll give you the phone number.
I think it would be a good idea to ask if delivery is possible.
Yes, thank you. Thank you for your hard work.
Nice to meet you, I am #@Affiliation# #@Name#

Please check slowly and guide me.
Yes, I understand. I will check and contact you.
Teacher, I received a call. Teacher, did you contact the district office first?
I've called the district office several times, but no action has been taken.
So I was wondering if it's okay to dig into that once a year?
I was going to ask once, but they didn't take any action.
Even if you dig it up once a year, they say they'll come back and restore it to its original state.
Then we dig it up again once a year
The roads and rivers you mentioned are each divided into departments.
Regarding rivers, I checked and found that there is a river safety department in the provincial government.
And you can also check it at the general construction business office.
Yes, it's a country road, a country muddy water, a muddy valley water.
Is this a question about ditches?
They keep narrowing the ditch to use it, and they don't even give permission to use the river road.
#@Affiliation# Even if I tell the person in charge of the 100-day event, nothing happens
So I was wondering if there are any legal sanctions?
By the way, is this a rural road?
The people living there keep digging it up to use it as a road.
Geumsan-gu Office came several times and took corrective action.
But they always break it once a year
I just wanted to ask if there is any legal action against touching the country's land.
In that case, I will contact #@affiliation# and then provide guidance.
Nice to meet you, I am #@Affiliation# #@Name#
How can I help you, sir?

Yes hello what's up
Yes, we are conducting a survey on satisfaction with the process of receiving and processing complaints.
Excuse me, but can I talk to you for a moment about your work?
Yes, you can call
Yes, thank you. I have three questions.
Have you experienced any inconveniences or have any suggestions for improvement while handling civil affairs?
I've never seen a civil servant, and I've never even talked to one.
Then, isn't that the part where you visited and worked?
I did your work, but I didn't visit.
Then, when you apply for reissue of your nursing assistant certificate
Isn't this the part where you applied for direct viewing or wiretapping?
No, I asked our office to do it.
You did the work by requesting it from an educational institution.
We were contacting you to conduct a survey on the satisfaction of wiretapping officials.
Yeah, I see. Sorry.
It's okay. Please take care of your health in this hot weather.
Nice to meet you, I'm #@Affiliation# #@Name# How may I help you?
We are from Chungnam Asan #@. Can you connect us with culture and tourism?

Teacher, there are many positions in charge at #@affiliation#
Please tell me the details of your work and I will check and inform you.
I want to know the routes and such for beach users and valley users in the Chungnam region.
Are you inquiring about the movement routes of beachgoers in the Chungnam region?

Please tell me how many guests there are
Yes, the person in charge of managing tourist convenience facilities has been confirmed at #@affiliation#
I will contact you after I contact you.

Hello, this is #@Affiliation#. Is #@Name# not in your seat?
Hello, I got a call.
Hello, this is #@Affiliation# #@Name#
Mr. Ju, Mr. Minwon, you have a complaint about the inconvenience at the water park while you are touring.
I filed a complaint with #@affiliation# but it was not resolved, so I am looking for the person in charge of wiretapping.
What inconvenience did you experience at the water park?
It is an amusement facility, but there are parts where the safety personnel are negligent in their duties and do not take action even if they are injured.
If calling #@affiliation# doesn't solve the problem, they say they're reporting it to wiretapping
But actually, we are not the ones who are involved in the amusement facilities, but I am only involved in the accommodation facilities.
So, it is difficult to confirm the exact person in charge right now, so I would like to ask the department to connect you.
In terms of disaster-related safety, disaster response, and disaster safety in Korea, this is right.
I will convey the information to your petitioner.
Yes, I think it would be better to contact #@affiliation#
#@Affiliation# Even if you say so, don't you know exactly what department the safety room is in right now?
There is a distinction between social disasters and natural disasters.
First of all, I will check and inform you. Thank you.
Nice to meet you, this is #@Affiliation#. How may I help you?
Yes, can I ask you to wiretap #@affiliation#?
Teacher, is this a request to connect to #@affiliation#?

Last time I was at the daycare on the 6th of July
Regarding the pastor's violation of the prohibition against holding multiple positions as a pastor
I sent an official letter to #@Affiliation# asking them to investigate.
Are you talking about the daycare center?
It is a violation of the Childcare Act and the prohibition against holding concurrent positions as a pastor.
The director of the daycare center sent an official letter regarding the violation of the ban on pastors holding concurrent positions.
I just checked and it says it arrived on the 6th of July
Teacher, I will check and inform you. Could you please wait a moment?
I will contact #@affiliation# and connect you with the part you asked about.
Yes, thank you. Please hurry.

Yes, please wait a moment. Civil survey design. This is called general.
Yes, it is normal in this case.
Then please connect me with the person in charge of the relevant department.

I wish you would create a medical school in #@affiliation#
Why does #@affiliation# need a medical school?
Because #@affiliation# medical school is closing down
So, I guess the medical school seats will be allocated somewhere now.
Is there no medical school in #@affiliation# right now?
Yes, there is no medical school in #@affiliation# right now.
But there is a hospital in the #@affiliation# area, a public hospital or something
If you bring the medical school hospital as it is, it is a national university.
It's easy to establish a medical school like this.
So, are you saying that we should bring the provincial hospital to #@affiliation#, a national university?
Yes, that would make things easier.
Yes, sir, I will add your opinion to the voice of the people.

Then where do you do it?
Excuse me, which bus will you be taking to Cheonan?
There are several here
Then, you can find out arrival information by contacting the bus company.
Then what I'm saying here is meaningless.
Yes, I'm sorry, but it's difficult for us to confirm.
Okay, I understand. I'll ask the bus company.
Nice to meet you, this is #@Affiliation#. How may I help you?
Teacher, I called because I had a question.

Is that intellectual or general, is it different from intellectual?
Yes, it is divided into intellectual surveying and general surveying.
If you look here, it says civil engineering surveying equipment, and here it is Cheonan #@affiliation#
When registering a business, I don't know much about the qualification requirements and such.
Yes, you don't know the qualifications, etc.
We asked the city hall, but they told us to ask the provincial government.
My business is now a service civil engineering survey design and it's like this.
Is this related to intelligence or is it general? It's separate
I need to know whether the surveying you mentioned is cadastral surveying or general surveying.
The Land Management Department has separate staff.

I will check the number and let you know.
Could you please wait a moment?
Yes, I will wait for your guidance.
Hello, this is #@Affiliation# Call Center #@Name# How may I help you?
Yes, I called because I had a question.
Our animal ran away from home and is now wandering around the neighborhood like this.
I don't think this can go on any longer, so I'm asking to see if you can help me.
I guess you must have been very surprised, teacher.
We will guide you after confirming the institution you can contact for the inquiry you have made.
Yes, I will wait for your guidance.
Teacher, can you tell me what kind of animal that you mentioned?
We have two Jindo dogs.
Are these two Jindo dogs?

I will check the number and give you directions. Could you please wait a moment?
Can you help me with something like this?
Yes, it is difficult to confirm that part, so I think it would be better to inquire about it.
Nice to meet you, I am #@Affiliation# #@Name# How may I help you?
Yes, I want to file a complaint. I live in an apartment.
I have filed several complaints about dust and noise, but there has been no improvement.
Yes, it's about noise, sir.
Yeah, I took it to the district office and complained, but it didn't work out.
I'm thinking of filing a complaint to #@affiliation#
Excuse me, what is your area?
The region is Cheonan, South Chungcheong Province. Yes.
You are from Chungnam and have raised this issue with #@affiliation# several times, but it has not been addressed.
Are the complaints about dust and noise at the apartment site?
There are only about thirty cars in a straight line about thirty meters in front of my house.
They do construction work at night, and even after nine o'clock, they still have dozens of ready-mix concrete trucks parked in front of houses.
Yes, I understand your situation.
Yes, that's also done at night, with only the taillights on and no one using the signal.
When you do the foundation work, you put down those tiles, right?
I heard there's a crack in your house too.
Yeah, they're saying that it's not a crack that's caused by hitting it.
From our perspective, I think it was a shock to hit someone from thirty meters away.
I see. It must have been very difficult for you.
So I filed a complaint, and #@affiliation# came out after all the tiles were laid.
I was told to install a crack detector, so I installed it, but I wonder if it's meaningful.
Yes, sir. I will connect you to the person in charge of the relevant department.
Yes, thank you. Please connect me. Thank you for your hard work.
Thank you #@Affiliation# #@Name#
Hello, this is #@Name# #@Name#

Hello, I have a favor to ask #@Affiliation#
There are several teams in #@affiliation#
Teacher, please tell me the details of your work and I will check and inform you.
I am looking at the account book of Boryeong-si, Chungcheongnam-do.
But our village is a village of poor people who receive welfare benefits.
And it's a neighborhood where only elderly people, single mothers, and people with disabilities live.
We are four hundred and seventy-eight generations, and there are about sixty-seven hundred people.
But 240 thousand won comes from the East
And they're taking that twenty-forty thousand won with interest.
Is it true that 240,000 won went out and came back in?
Yes, I said I was going out and then came back.
Then, they give me 240,000 won as a deposit.
Yes, teacher, I will connect you to #@affiliation#
Yes, thank you. Thank you for your hard work.
Hello teacher, this is #@name# who spoke to me earlier.
If the road you mentioned is a provincial road
You can check it at #@affiliation#
If it's a road in the village, sir
For market-related matters, you must contact your local district office for an answer.
The wiretapping department is saying that there is no jurisdiction over the wiretapping department.
In the case of local roads, it was passed on to the responsible department.
Is this a local road?
Yes, that's a local road.
If not the district office, where should I report this to #@affiliation#?
Should I just go to the #@affiliation# complaint office and talk to them?
Okay, then I'll give it a try
If you don't accept it even in your wiretapping
Yes, is this the inquiry regarding the damage to the river road next to the ditch at #@address#?
They keep digging once a year for three years without a permit.
And yet no action is taken
Is it true that you are damaging ditches or rivers without a road use permit?
Yes, which higher-level agency should I contact? Should I contact the wiretapping civil affairs office?
In that case, should I file a complaint with the #@affiliation# civil affairs office or not?
Please leave your name and contact information and we will call you right away.
Nice to meet you, I'm #@Affiliation# #@Name# How may I help you?

Have you tried contacting the city or county office?
Yes, I asked you before
On your side, you said that it should be done by a professional processing company.
When I called them, they said they couldn't handle it because they didn't have a license.
Is that so, sir? Is this something you want to report regarding construction waste?
Yes, you have to report it and dispose of it.
Since this is designated waste, there is no company to handle it.
I think we used to handle it all together
Now that it's been classified, I think the factories have disappeared.
Teacher, where are you now?
I live in Boryeong, South Chungcheong Province. Please find a company that handles other areas.
Can I contact you at this number after checking the details you have inquired about?
Yes, it would be better if you contact me this way.
Then I will contact you after checking.
Okay, then I'll ask you.
Any other questions?
No, please take care of this first.
Yes, I will contact you as soon as I check it. #@Affiliation# #@Name#
How can I help you, sir?
I have something to ask you.
I heard that a notice was posted saying that #@Address# in Dangjin, South Chungcheong Province was canceled.

Could you please wait a moment?

I would like to inquire about this multi-child tax reduction benefit and car tax reduction benefit.

If you sell the car within a year of receiving this deduction, you will have to pay it again.

Yes, sir, I'm sorry, but what region was it?
At that time, I did it in Gongju. I did it in Gongju.
The place I live now is Cheongyang-gun.
I received a notice of tax exemption and reduction from Cheongyang-gun.
Yes, you received the notice from Cheongyang County.
But now I see that if you sell the car within a year, you won't get that discount.
So they came flying in saying that they would charge me the difference again and collect it.
Is the name of the tax exemption reduction decision notice correct? It is a county office notice.
Yes, it was sent from Cheongyang County Office.
Yes, sir. I will connect you with the person in charge of the relevant department.

This is a request for policy implementation.
Teacher, I don't quite understand.
Aren't you curious about the establishment of a university?

There is something I want to say about that part.
I just hope that Governor #@Name# becomes the mayor of Seoul next year.

The subway station is Daejeon Station.
It is confirmed that you take the subway from Daejeon Station and get off at #@Address# Station.
Once you get off, it takes about three minutes to walk to Daejeon Citizen University.
But is that the old city hall?

Any other questions?
No, thank you
Yes, thank you #@affiliation#
Nice to meet you, I am #@Affiliation# #@Name# How may I help you?
Because the construction site near my house was so inconvenient, I even installed a crack detector at the site.
Yes, sir, there is construction going on near your house.
They check the meter on site once a month, but there is no change.
Now, since it's right in front of us, I heard that it's going up to the 23rd floor.
Yes, sir, that's the situation.
Yes, yes, because everyone can see into our house, it's an invasion of privacy or something like that.
When they're doing construction here, they turn off the noisemakers when they're making noise.
I also took a picture of the sound level meter.
Yes, customer, you have filed a complaint.
Yes, I made a complaint to you, so turn it on right away.
Is that so, teacher? Then, did you get an answer to that question?
No, we should have received a call like this first.
He said he missed it. When I called him twenty days later, he got really angry.
Yes, you missed it.
Now I feel like I'm being unreasonable because I'm just sitting still.
This is so bad for me right now that I'm really stressed out.
Yes, teacher. So is it the wall that has cracks?
Yes, that's right. The reason I called here was because I wanted to file a complaint.
But there is an order to this
Okay, I will check with the person in charge at #@affiliation# and let you know.

Teacher, what about the telecommunications company?
I'm using U+ right now
Then I will check the phone number of the telecommunications company and inform you.

We will contact you after confirmation.
Nice to meet you, I'm #@Affiliation# #@Name# How may I help you?
Yes, I'm calling to inquire about your passport.

How long does it take to reissue a passport?
If you issue it at your local police station, if there are no issues with your identity verification,

Okay, thanks for letting me know.
Nice to meet you, this is #@Affiliation#. How may I help you?

Which area of the city is being developed by the wiretapping department?
Budget side, budget side
Are you a #@affiliation# working at #@affiliation#?

Yes, teacher, are you asking about the route?
Yes, I was wondering if it was possible to go that way on the highway.
Are you talking about the case where the teacher travels by car?
Yes, I will go by car.
Yes, I will check the part you asked about and then inform you.
Could you please wait a moment?
Yes, please check slowly and let me know.
Yes, I will contact you after checking.
Yes, hello, this is #@Affiliation# #@Name#
Yeah, what's the reason for that?
Yes, you called me regarding the gym water shortage.
I would like to ask how long the short-term period will be.
There is no time limit #@Address# Until the dam drought is resolved
Can I tell you that this is something that has not been confirmed at all as of now?
Yes, the water level at #@address#dam is only nineteen right now.
A man called me just now
Yes, you are a man
I'm the one who calls all the time, so please transfer my call to the one that's up right now.
Okay, I understand. I'll call you back.
Yes, thank you. Thank you for your hard work.
Nice to meet you #@ How may I help you?
This is a water park. Many children got hurt here. They don't manage safety.
Are you in charge of water park safety management?
Yes, it starts at ten o'clock, so please prepare after ten o'clock.
Even at ten o'clock, the supervisor is still holding a cell phone and pretending to spray water.
In the case of security guards, they say they did all they had to do by just standing there.
Yes, sir, I fully understand the inconvenience you are experiencing.
We will check if the person in charge of the water park is in the city hall and inform you.
Yes, please connect quickly.
I'm really sorry, sir. The person in charge is out of town.

Yes, thank you #@Affiliation# #@Name#
Nice to meet you, I am #@Affiliation# #@Name#
How can I help you, sir?
Yes, there is a bus that goes back and forth between Incheon and Daejeon.
I think the #@affiliation# wiretapping department has jurisdiction over that.
I filed a complaint because I was guided like that.
Did you receive that guidance?
Did you file any complaint?
I'm a student now
They told me to pay the adult rate without getting a discount.
That's why I filed a complaint
But the answer doesn't make sense
Does it make sense to answer that you have to find your own rights?
But you can't fight at the ticket booth.
Yes, sir, is this the part where the person in charge of #@affiliation# answered you?
Yeah, I think so
Excuse me, but is there anything you don't know?
Yes, I didn't hear the name of the person who answered.
Then I will check and get back to you.
#@Affiliation# #@Name# Thank you

If you want to take a bus that will take you there at once, take the bus at #@address# station exit 6.
You can take bus number 48 and get off at City Hall.
Then, you said the train would arrive at 45 minutes later.

The bus ride takes about one hour and eight minutes.
The departure point is #@Address# University's College of Agriculture.
Yes, is this the number 48 bus?
Yes, how long does it take from there to the station #@address#?
There is a #@address#university agricultural college terminal on the route and also a #@address#university agricultural college front.
No, at the final destination, there is time, so you have to roughly calculate the time and wait.
Sorry, I don't know the exact bus schedule.
Okay, I understand. I'll go and check it out. Thank you.
Nice to meet you, this is #@affiliation# How may I help you?

I'm calling you again to ask about your satisfaction with agricultural technology-related work.
I understand that it is a satisfaction survey.
#@Affiliation# Have you ever felt uncomfortable or had something to improve while working with a civil servant?
There wasn't anything like that
When you consulted with a civil servant from #@affiliation#, what was the civil servant's attitude?
I had no faith because he was a person who consistently lied about what he felt.
Are you upset because your work wasn't done properly?
Yes, I can't believe it.
How satisfied were you with the way civil complaints were handled?
I am not satisfied with the results
How satisfied do you think you are with the results? Satisfied, Average, Dissatisfied, Very Dissatisfied
I'm very dissatisfied, of course I am.
We will check the overall complaint handling based on the part you are dissatisfied with.

The intercity bus travel time is confirmed to be approximately fifty minutes.

I would like to file a complaint
Teacher, please tell me what is causing you inconvenience.
There is something called #@affiliation# in Seocheon
I went there yesterday and they charged an entrance fee of five thousand won.
Yes, you mean #@affiliation#, sir
No, I paid 5,000 won and got in.
Before I went in, I said I had scattered clams there yesterday.
Yes, you spread clams in the experience center last night.
And then he guided us in here
Some of the clams were dead and only a few were alive.
If I put it this way, it would be a bit weird, but almost half of them died.
Yes, sir. I will connect you to the department in charge.
Yes, thank you. Thank you for your hard work.
Hello, I don't have a local road occupancy permit.

Yes, specifically river damage?
Yes, river damage and road damage.
But that keeps getting dug up once a year
For three years, has the person in charge at #@affiliation# been taking money and turning a blind eye to it?
I'm asking because I'm frustrated right now.
Yes, I'm sorry for the inconvenience.
Yes, so do I have to go to the city hall and file a complaint?
Where should I go to apply?
Otherwise, should I call a reporter and do it?
I'm asking because I want to know why action isn't being taken.
Yes, teacher, the part I mentioned
After checking with the person in charge of the department, we will contact the teacher immediately.
And do you have any other questions?
No, no questions, thank you
Yes, I will contact you right away.
Hello, this is #@Affiliation# #@Name#
Excuse me, sir, but I'm contacting you to ask you something.
Yes, this is #@Affiliation# #@Name#. Please tell me what you are inquiring about.
The petitioner says it is difficult to determine whether it is a general survey or a cadastral survey.
We are looking for someone in charge of design related to civil engineering surveying design.
Are you talking about the surveying business related to civil engineering surveying design?
Yes, that's right, surveying.
Then, it's a general surveying business, and the person in charge today is #@Name#
But he went on a business trip today and went out to film with a drone.
In that case, isn't there a staff member who can answer instead?
I went out to the area today to do some drone filming.
I'd like to leave a note and call you on Monday if it's not urgent.
Yes, I understand. Thank you for confirming.

Is there anyone I can contact regarding this matter?
Then, would you like to change the phone number?
Yes, I will connect you now. You can call right away.
Nice to meet you, this is #@affiliation# How may I help you?
Please connect me with the person in charge of welfare.
Depending on the teacher's job description, the department in charge is divided into several departments.
It is difficult for us to confirm exactly what is not an inconvenience to the housekeeper.
For the development of the entire Seocheon County, everyone is criticizing everything.
I also plan to run for National Assembly later.
So I went around and asked the residents what they thought.
The wiretapping department should be auditing, but the county office is just being lenient.
#@Address# Requests for audits should be directed to the #@Affiliation# audit team.
#@Affiliation# The audit team is full of people I know, so it's useless
Then, is there anything you are uncomfortable with about civil servants in the county office?
No, I am a former civil servant of #@affiliation#
In the case of a report of inconvenience to a public official, there are employees at the provincial government who handle related work.
However, the overall #@address# part is divided according to the work content.
So it's hard to confirm the exact part
I'm not asking for the whole thing, but to go to the #@address# self-reliance center and ask for an audit.
Are you grateful for the self-reliance center?
Is there anyone in charge of the audit? Please connect me.
Yes, I will connect you with the person in charge of the relevant business. Thank you.
Nice to meet you, this is #@Affiliation#. How may I help you?
In the process of waste disposal, we are herbal medicines.
We discard this based on the same criteria as Western medicine.
Yes, teacher, please continue speaking.
Herbal medicines are grown underground like agricultural products.
But when you try to discard this, it's too hard to discard.
Is there anything inconvenient about disposing of it? Is the procedure complicated?
Yes, companies that handle waste disposal, like us, dispose of small quantities.
But they don't accept it very well
Common sense tells you that you should not sell this as a medicine and just throw it away.
I'll ask you to continue speaking.
You have to go to a waste disposal company to dispose of it.
As a result, it is very difficult to find this company.
If you want to discard it, this is Geumsan, but you have to go to Dangjin or something.
For example, it's really upsetting to throw away something like 120 kilos.
For example, I think it would be okay to just go through this process, like burying it in the ground.
If you leave it alone, it will rot away in the normal environment.
Yes, I fully understand the difficult part of the process you are dealing with.
Shall I connect you to the relevant department?
Yes, please connect me. Thank you for your hard work.
Hello, this is counselor #@name# from #@affiliation#.
I would like to file a complaint
Yes, what kind of complaint is it?
We have been picnicking on the river for several days and there is a caravan parked long term.
#@Address#, please take action
We apologize for any inconvenience caused during your camping trip.
We will do our best to periodically check the site and take action.
Yes, I have a favor to ask.
Yes thank you it was #@name#
Hello. This is counselor #@name# from #@affiliation#
My e-passport got wet, so I wanted to ask if I can use it.
In that case, please visit a nearby passport office.
You must request confirmation that the reading is normal.
What should I do if it is not readable?
If it is not readable, you will need to get a new passport issued.
Yes, thank you for letting me know.
Hello, I am counselor #@Affiliation# and #@Name#
Any help needed?
The number of Pyeongtaek buses to Seoul has noticeably decreased.
In particular, operations have been reduced during rush hours.
Why on earth is this happening?
It seems to be due to the recent spread and long-term nature of the coronavirus.
The company is currently operating the vehicle at its own discretion.
Is there any problem with doing that?
I would like to ask the transportation company to return to normal operation as soon as possible.
I will submit future plans, etc.
Yes, thank you for your quick response.
No, it was counselor #@name#
I will do my best #@Affiliation# #@Name#
Thank you for your hard work. I just have a question.
Yes, what is the question you are contacting us with?
I would like to make a suggestion regarding the absurdity of forcing university student ID cards.
Regarding academic affairs such as issuing student ID cards
This is something that each university organizes and operates autonomously according to its characteristics.
Then, it would be difficult to get the answer you want even if you ask here.
Yes, but for detailed confirmation of the complaint.
We will forward your request to the relevant school.
Yes, I think that would be good
If you have any further questions, please contact #@Affiliation##@Phone#
Thank you for your kind reply
Thank you, counselor #@name#. Have a nice day.
Yes, have a nice day. Thank you for your hard work.
I will do my best #@Affiliation# #@Name#
I'm contacting you with a suggestion.
Yes, what do you suggest?
This is #@Address#, Cheoin-gu, Yongin-si, Gyeonggi-do
The streetlight bulb on the road went out.
Please take action
We have assigned the maintenance company to work on it and will make improvements soon.
Yes, please.
Do you have any other suggestions?
No, there isn't, thank you
Yes thank you it was #@name#
Hello, I am the manager of #@Affiliation# #@Name#
Is this the #@address# community gym?
Yes, how can I help you?
Can you please open the community gym pool sooner?
This time, the results of the detailed safety diagnosis came out.
Sorry, but we need to do some reinforcement work on the bottom of the pool.
Why is the entire building closed when only the lower part is under construction? Swimming is also a required subject.
First of all, it is currently closed due to Corona.
How long will the construction be completed?
It is expected to be finished within the month.
Are you sure about that? I wonder
We promise to post a separate notice on the website in case of any changes.
Okay, I can't help it. I'll hang up.
Sorry I can't help you right away #@Affiliation#
This is #@affiliation# that delivers good energy.
Nice to meet you. How may I help you?
Yes, I called you earlier.
Regarding #@Affiliation# information
Yes, sir, do you have any other questions?
Yes, I was wondering if I could receive it through KakaoTalk.
It seems like everyone does that these days
Yes, you can do it with KakaoTalk.
You can add a channel by searching for #@affiliation# in the app.
Does this come up like a text message every now and then?
No, this circuit is sent monthly
Then isn't it too little?
I guess I'll just have to email it to you.
I think it would be better to do it the way you prefer.
Okay, I understand. Thank you for your hard work.
Yes, it was #@affiliation# until now
This is #@Affiliation# #@Name# working with customers. How can I help you?
Yes, I have a question.
#@Guitar# I'm looking at that #@Guitar# and #@Guitar#
#@Other# Are the two textbooks different?
Isn't the person calling one of our members?
A non-member contacted you for study consultation.
No, I'm not a member yet
Thank you for your words. Thank you for your interest and contact.
We have #@Other# and regular premium
Our #@guitar# is based on the #@guitar# textbook
I created the Wellstudy textbook based on it.
So we basically have #@Other# textbooks
We are condensing the important content and moving forward.
For example, how does it proceed?
For example, if there are few examples, they are compressed in that way.
Please think of it as a textbook created with the concept of cost-effectiveness.
Yes, but #@Guitar# does it have to be a visiting teacher?
It is possible without a visiting teacher
There is also a basic plan that only manages video calls.
Yes, I understand. Thank you.
Thank you mom #@name#
This is #@Affiliation# #@Name# working with customers. How can I help you?
Yes, thank you for your hard work. This is #@guitar#
Could you please check if this server is operating normally?
#@Other# You asked if the server is operating normally.
What is the director's contact information?
Yes, #@phone number#
I can't find the number on this page.
Can't I? Just wait. I'll check again.
Yes, I will wait.
This number is correct
Is that right? What is your name, sir?
My name is #@name#
Could you please wait a moment? I'm checking right now.
Would it be okay if I checked and got back to you?
Yes, then please check and contact me.
#@Affiliation# #@Name# How may I help you?
I had an error a little while ago and called
When I finished studying and went out and came back, it was back to the beginning.
Are you saying that you finished all the learning and then came back to the beginning?
No, there was about a minute left
But now you're saying that the sound source will be played again from the beginning?
Yes, that's right, it starts playing from the beginning.
Customer, then we will check the information first.
I think I need to set fast forward
Fast forward, okay, I understand.
Wait a minute, I'll check the information first and then give you some guidance.
Excuse me, but could you please tell me the name of the child you are studying with and the last 4 digits of the mother's number?
My daughter's name is #@name# and her phone number is #@phone number#
Thank you for confirming your valuable information.
The person in charge will guide you through the setup method you requested.
Please wait a moment and we will connect you.
Yes, I'll wait. Please connect.
This is #@Affiliation# #@Name# working with customers. How can I help you?
Hello, I'm calling to ask you something.
I was informed about the learning format.
Yes, you have received consultation from us.
Yes, but I'm curious about how the learning materials will be processed.
Basically, it's called an English class.
Now, in the case of learning where a visiting teacher visits,
Now it is almost entirely self-directed learning.
We are proceeding with the basic learning tablet.
Please purchase a dedicated learning device or install the learning app now.
When you study, the manager establishes a study plan.
We now provide management services by visiting the monthly social center once a week.
Basically, learning is done by members themselves using their own learning tools.
There is also a function that allows you to listen to the audio source and record it while listening to it.
There is a learning method where you record yourself listening to the voice of a native speaker.
And after one course of study is completed, there is also evaluation study.
So there are a lot of things you have to do yourself.
Yes, by myself
This is #@Affiliation# #@Name# working with customers. How can I help you?
Yes, here is #@guitar#
Yes, how may I help you?
Yes, right now there is no internet at all at the academy, so I can't do anything.
If you don't have internet access, you mean you can't use the learning tool?
The internet itself doesn't work, so I can't study, I can't use the computer, and everything else is like that.
Even when you just open the internet, it doesn't connect.
Yeah, Katie, I called somewhere like that. Does that have nothing to do with the head office?
Usually, when general internet doesn't work, it's because of a problem with KT's line.
Most of the problems can be solved by first checking with Katie.
Well then, I guess I'll have to call the line now.
#@Other# It's not just the program that doesn't work, but the general internet doesn't work either.
#@Affiliation# If the program doesn't work, we will check it separately.
In cases like this, please have the line checked by KT first.
If you get a line check and the connection is still disconnected,
It may not work for us
Then I'll check the line first and try again.
Yes, please check your internet connection and contact us again.
Yes, I will do that.
Yes thank you #@name# have a nice day
This is #@Affiliation# #@Name# with our customers.
How can I help you?
I called you last time and the dictation came from the beginning.
The counselor told me to try setting it up, but it didn't work well.
Yes, sir, this is a question about dictation.
Yes but I didn't know how to dictate
I didn't know I had set it up here
So I don't know how to do the detailed part at the end.
Now you know today
Do you have any questions about dictation settings?
Yes, so if you look at that part, it's all X'ed out.
The kids were doing it, but I changed it halfway through.
But now the kids are doing it to some extent
So I had to log out and log in again to get to that part.
So I went back in and started learning again from the beginning.
Yes, you finished the part you finished in the middle while learning audio.
Then, have you tried setting it in smart learning?
Yes, the kids have already started learning audio.
I came today and couldn't do it in advance, so I was doing it in the middle.
I reset the dictation
Then, after setting it up and logging in, it will be applied from the learning stage.
After setting it, you have to set it again and the member has to log in again for it to take effect.
Yes, so the kids were doing it for about half a year, but now they're starting from the beginning again.
But that part can't be set like this
This is #@Affiliation# #@Name# with customers
How may I help you?
Yes, I am a teacher at #@Affiliation# #@Name#
Here, a member named #@name# registered last week.
That #@guitar# won't work, so I'll take that
Member #@Other#, you are a member, but you say #@Other# is not created?
So, members who are learning #@Other# do not use it as a dedicated device.
You are learning with a general purpose device.
Yes, I am learning with a general purpose device.
Even though I installed the app #@Other# and the evaluation app #@Other# is not created
Your app says that #@Other# cannot be created
Could you please tell me the member's name and original code?
I think a professional consultant will need to contact you and check it out.
But you are using your mother's number.
It's okay, just tell me your name and original code.
I told you earlier that I had your mother's number.
Don't you have a separate app?
I need to come in for a consultation
No, we will contact you and check it out.
I'll give you your mother's phone number.
Yes, member, what is your name?
The member name is #@name# and the phone number is #@phone number#
Yes, I will make sure to contact you quickly.
Hello, this is #@Affiliation# #@Name#
Mom, first we'll set the fast forward setting.
Right now fast forward will be disabled
Then, you need to turn the power off and then on again.
You're telling me to reboot this?
Yes, we will activate fast forward for you.
After running #@Product# again
When the arrow on the right becomes active, please long press it
Then the fast forward will be applied
Okay, I understand. I'll give it a try.
I'll try to turn it back off again later this evening to make it faster.
Yes, I'm turning it off and then back on now
Yes, now #@Product# will be synchronized again.
Mom, once the download is complete
I have applied the right arrow to be activated in the screen smart learning.
Then please press and hold there
It asked me if I wanted to continue the interrupted learning.
Yes, please select confirmation.
Yes, I pressed this
Then the audio will now be forwarded in fast forward mode.
I would like you to proceed with the study once, leaving about a minute there.
Just like before, yes, thank you
Yes, I hope you have a nice afternoon. I am #@name#
This is #@Affiliation# #@Name# with our customers.
#@Name# Director, I contacted you earlier, so I am contacting you now.
Is there anything you're having trouble with right now? The computer is a bit slow.
The learning machine is not connecting right now. The server is not connecting.
Are all learning devices like that?
Yeah, I think so
Have you tried rebooting the server?
Yeah I tried that too
But you're saying the symptoms are the same?
No, there is no change.
This part is not yet confirmed by computer.
I think we need to ask our department to check.
Can I contact the director on his cell phone now?
Yes, please do that.
Is there a separate phrase that can be checked on the learning device?
As I said earlier, it says the server is not connected.
Yes, just confirm it like that
Yes, it only appears like that for now.
Yes, I understand. I will forward the relevant information to the department.
This is #@Affiliation# #@Name# working with customers. How can I help you?
I have a new child
It's working fine on the LMS management site now.
When I entered my membership number, what did it say?
Can you check what came out?
I think I'll have to check that out
Are there any cases where the passwords are not the same?
Please use the same password as another member is using now.
So I don't know, but these guys just told me
They're doing it and it seems like it's the same number
Will that cause any problems?
I think I need to check the exact details
Then, could you please check and contact me?
Okay, we'll check it out and get back to you.
Yes, thank you for your answer.
This is #@Affiliation# #@Name# working with customers. How can I help you?
I changed the date and time in settings, but it says the server time is not correct
If I click OK again, the automatic setting is back to green.
That's right, but you need to check the date and time now.
The date is confirmed as July 31st, 2018.
No, when I looked this morning, it said one thousand nine hundred and seventy-seven.
We sometimes experience this symptom in network-related matters.
Could you please change the time just once now?
Yes, I changed it
Yes, and can you confirm the time as 1:20 p.m.?
Yes, it was one twenty minutes ago.
Is it supposed to be in the afternoon? Please check by morning or afternoon.
It's twenty past twelve.
One twenty minutes past nine o'clock
Yes, it's twenty minutes past one.
Yes, then please use the back button.
The auto-setting part should obviously go back to blue.
Please try connecting once to learn.
Yes, it works now
This part is that we may not have a smooth network now.
Well, the time setting changes when the signal is a little unstable.
So at that time, just check the time and date
If you change it normally, the symptom will be resolved.
Okay, then I would like to ask you to proceed with the study.
If you have any further questions, please contact us.
Okay, I understand. Thank you for your hard work.
Yes thank you I was #@affiliation# #@name#
Have a cool and healthy day
This is #@Affiliation# #@Name# working with customers. How can I help you?
Hello, I'm calling to ask you something.
My baby is currently in the fourth grade of elementary school.
Yes, I'm in the fourth grade of elementary school.
Yes, I usually want to know what kind of things are good to do in the study materials here.
Mom, let me explain a little bit about our learning style.
I will guide you, but if you contact me for study consultation,
We transferred it to a nearby regional center.
I can provide you with the details so that you can receive detailed consultation.
Basically, we have this brand called #@Other#
There is a learning program where the manager visits the members' homes.
There is an academy format where members directly say #@Other#
It is divided into two types of direct visits.
So, you can proceed with the learning method that interests your mother.
Is the type of learning that your mother wants done by a visiting teacher?
I don't know what would be better right now, but I think you could do it by visiting
One thing we do at #@guitar# academy is something like a study guide.
One is that we take classes at the academy
Yes, that's right, mother.
Okay, I'll think about it and get back to you.
Yes, thank you #@Affiliation# #@Name#
This is #@Affiliation# #@Name# with our customers.
How can I help you?
I have a question about the learning management system.
Yes, sir, I have a question about the management system.
#@Name# Are you the director?
In order to provide accurate consultation, please confirm the name of the operating base.
#@Address# is where my kids are studying now.
In the middle, there may be cases where you need to log in again like this.
If I change the settings again or something like that,
Now the kids have logged out and logged back in.
This is going back to the part that was done before.
So can I do this again now? Can I set it up?
Yes, for example, you have studied up to a certain point.
When you log in again, you say the video starts from the beginning.
Yes, from the beginning
So, have you tried setting it up?
Even though I set it up correctly, it still starts from the beginning.
Then, I think it would be good to try setting it up once while studying.
Okay, let me set it up
If you have any difficulties, please contact us.
Yes, thank you for your answer.
This is #@Affiliation# #@Name# working with customers. How can I help you?
Yes, because the server time for #@product# doesn't match
It keeps saying I can't proceed with my studies.
Your learning process is not progressing because the server time is not correct.
Yes, it tells me to run it again after four hours.
I know it was inconvenient, but thank you for contacting us.
Excuse me, but is this member #@name#'s mother?
Yes #@name# is correct
Yes, in order to proceed with the consultation accurately, I would like to ask you one thing.
Can you please check the last four digits of the contact number registered with us?
The last digits of the number are #@phone number#
Thank you for confirming your valuable information.
Mom, in the text that confirms that the server time is not correct
If you look at the pop-up, there is a button that says Confirm.
Can I press this?
If you click OK, you will be taken to the settings window.
To your settings window
Yes, then if you look at the end of the phrase “automatic setting” at the very top,
There will be a green light on. Could you please turn that light off?
Yeah the lights are off
If you look at the bottom, there is a window where you can change the date and time.
Is the date confirmed as July 31st, 2018?
Yes, it's confirmed.
Okay, I think you can use it now
Yes, thank you for your answer.
This is #@Affiliation# #@Name# with customers
How may I help you?
Yes, I am a teacher at #@Affiliation# #@Name#
I contacted you earlier regarding the member #@Other# not working, so I'm checking it out.
The member name is #@name# and the phone number is #@phone number#
Teacher, I hope you started learning from #@Product# last week.
This study is progressing well.
#@Other# Have you not confirmed with the teacher that it is complete?
Yes, the completion itself is not working, and I asked the member to do #@Other#
I got a call three times saying it wasn't possible.
He said that it couldn't be done without it at all.
Yeah, I asked you to solve that problem.
Go in and the #@Other# tutoring evaluation app is installed.
I told him to solve the problem, but he kept saying there was no problem.
If you click on that click on the #@Other# rating app
You're saying there were no problems at all?
I couldn't solve the problem at all because there was no problem.
I know that we provide it every class.
I will contact a professional counselor for this part.
Teacher, would you be able to talk to me after this time?
Are you talking about me or you?
We have it at our member's house
I need to contact the parents of members who have learning devices.
I'm not sure when I can call my parents.
Then did the parents contact you or did you contact them directly?
The member contacted me, but the member was studying on his mother's cell phone.
Is that so, sir? Then we can make a reservation for around 5 o'clock.
We will contact you at #@Phone# to inspect the matter.
If we just send it to #@phone number#, there are many cases where people don't receive it.
The teacher told the parents that we would contact them about this around 5 o'clock.
I would appreciate it if you could just leave a text or KakaoTalk message
I'll tell your member to call you.
Yes, I think you can just tell me to receive it at #@phone number#
This is #@Affiliation# #@Name# working with customers. How can I help you?
I'm planning to take classes starting next week or next month.
I asked if it was compatible, but I downloaded the app.
Then I have that ID and password
#@Other# Can't you just use the one they made there?
#@Other# does not create an ID or password for you.
Your mother must go to the website and sign up for membership herself.
I went to the website and signed up for membership.
If you did, you should have an ID and password.
Isn't that what they made there?
Your mother must make it herself.
Okay, then I guess I was wrong.
I'm going to be taking classes next month, so I asked if the machine was compatible.
Thank you for visiting our website. Please sign up for membership.
You can sign up as a learning member.
Yes, thank you for your answer.
This is #@Affiliation# #@Name# working with customers. How can I help you?
When you enter that #@product# server
It says I can't proceed with learning because the server time doesn't match.
When you run #@affiliation#, it says that the server time is incorrect
Can you make it to your time?
Member, I will check the information first and then guide you through the settings.
Excuse me, but we can't find any information using the number you just provided.
Could you please confirm the mobile phone number of your mother registered with us?
Your number is #@phone#
Yes, thank you for confirming
Excuse me, what is the name of the member you are learning from?
Member name is #@name#
Yes, thank you for checking the valuable information. I will guide you through the setup now.
Do you have a learning device now?
I don't have it now. Is it possible to have it?
Yes, you must have it so I can guide you.
Okay, then I'll find it and call you back.
This is #@Affiliation# #@Name# with our customers.
You asked about your membership number and password this morning.
Yes, that's right. Have you checked?
Before I answer, what is our member's name?

Yes, this is #@affiliation#
Synchronization is not working as expected. How can I get it to sync?
It will say data synchronization in system management
Where is the sync of materials for learning?
If you look at data synchronization, there is no button to run synchronization.
There is something called data synchronization in system administration.
I can't see the system manager right now
#@Affiliation# Are you sure you have accessed the learning management system?
Yes #@Affiliation# Learning Management System
Go into system management there.
You have to go into the teacher's management
No, on the right is System Management
Member management on the right
No, not member management, but system management.
Go into system management
In your system management, click the Synchronize button in Data Synchronization.
You are currently in your twenties.
This is exactly what I pressed, but it didn't work right away.
Yes, this is a little bit difficult. Could you give me twenty-nine minutes?
Yes, it's done now.
Yes, please try logging in again.
What do you mean by logging in and pressing sync again?
No, you have synced it to the learning machine, so please try logging in again.
Okay, thank you
Then, please proceed.
Yes, I understand. Thank you.
Yes, thank you. Have a nice day.
This is #@Affiliation# #@Name# with our customers.
I'm contacting you because of the distribution history of #@name# that you mentioned earlier.
I have something to check. How many volumes of NT do you have?
I have to start studying the three books of Sa-gwon today, but they say I can't.
You are saying that it is not possible in the four books.
Are you saying that you can't see it in the textbook view?
The teacher made a schedule, but I can't see any studying at all.
The center director doesn't have the device right now.
No, I don't have a separate device.
Then I think I should talk to the teacher and our learning team.
This should come out because it is not a textbook that has passed its audio source period.
But it's strange that you have a study plan and also see the textbooks that were released.
You're saying that he won't come out anymore?
The teacher has set up a schedule for reading.
I don't know why my child says he doesn't seem to be studying.
So I think you'll need to check this again with your teacher.
I am a member of the general consulting team, so it is difficult for me to confirm this here.
If you tell me your teacher's information, I will tell him to contact you.
I think that would be a good idea
Then, is it okay if I call you between two and three o'clock?
I'm in class, but please call me first.
Then, your name is #@name# and what is your teacher's contact number?
Yes, my number is #@phone#
Okay, I understand. Then I will tell the learning team to contact you.
This is #@Affiliation# #@Name# working with customers. How can I help you?
I'm curious because my child hasn't yet mastered Korean.
Is it still possible to take the class?
No, it doesn't matter.
So do you write a lot or do you start by reading?
Yes, I'm sorry, but each of our teachers has a different way of coaching this part.
Mom, can you please tell me about a counselor at a center near where I live?
First, I will help you apply so that you can receive counseling.
Check with the teacher to see how he teaches.
I think it would be best to call them directly
Can I have your mother's contact information and your child's name?
Yes, my number is #@phone#
What is your child's name?
My name is #@name#
Can you tell me the neighborhood you live in?
In Bucheon City #@Address#
Is it just #@address# without moving anything, mom?
I'm not sure which dong it is
Same as above, okay
Then, we will first contact a counselor at a nearby center.
When is it convenient for you to call?
How long does it take to call?
You can call after this time
No, I have to pick up the kids now.
Yeah, you're busy right now.
I think it'll be fine within twenty minutes.
If you say no, I can do it in the morning.
Tomorrow morning time slot

Yeah, then I was wrong
Actually, parent membership is not mandatory.
You may or may not sign up, but learning membership is required.
Yes, I understand. I misunderstood and told the teacher.
I'm going to explain that in class starting next month.
First, check if the machine is compatible.

Even if you study the previous course, there are cases where the books for the next level are locked.
In what cases does that happen?
If you get more than 80 points from reading the book and solving the quizzes, you will receive a complete stamp.
What do you do with a complete dojo?
The next week's books will be unlocked once you reach a certain level of completion.

Well, then I don't know the exact upload time.

#@Affiliation# If you go, will they teach you things like how to study and problem-solving skills?
I was wondering if I need to take the #@affiliation# lecture in particular
The amount of study required for the civil service exam is enormous and trivial.
It would be nice if everyone studied and understood, but realistically, there are many things that are impossible.
Yes, so our #@affiliation# 1st class instructors are among these contents
It is more advantageous because it divides and explains the parts that are likely to appear on the test.
I think I can study more efficiently.
Yes, and I will also teach you how to solve problems quickly depending on the type.
Okay, I'll think about it and get back to you.
Have a nice day, this was counselor #@name#

Yes, how may I help you?
What kind of teacher is good for civil servant Korean language?
It's hard to say which teacher is better because everyone has their own style.
So how do I find the right teacher for me?
You can listen to each teacher's OT lecture.
I recommend that you search by reading various success stories.
I was interested in teacher #@name#, so I guess I'll have to listen to it.
I hope you find the teacher that is right for you and pass the exam in a short period of time.
Yes, thank you. I understand.
Thank you #@Affiliation# #@Name#
I am #@Affiliation# counselor #@Name#, full of happiness.
#@Affiliation# I'm trying to take a class taught by instructors from #@Name# #@Name# #@Name#
Yes, how may I help you?
Teachers, there are so many different types of textbooks that I don't know what's what.
In that case, I recommend our introductory course.
When you start the introductory course, most of the textbook-related parts are also explained.
Well, then I guess it would be right to listen to each teacher's introductory lecture first.
Yes, I think you will get the concept of the curriculum if you listen to it once.
Yes, thank you. I understand.
Do you have any further questions?
No, thank you. Thank you for your hard work.
Have a nice day, this was counselor #@name#

Yes, how may I help you?
By any chance, #@affiliation# instructors, can you tell me the start date of the lecture and the publication date of the textbook in 2022?
First of all, since there are many instructors, it is difficult to share everything.
It is organized on each instructor's personal page on our homepage.
When do you usually need to know?
Typically, lectures and book publishing start around July.
Yes, thank you. I understand.
Please check our website for more detailed information.
Yes, thank you for explaining it in detail.
Yes, this was counselor #@name#
Start your day with a good feeling #@Affiliation# Counselor #@Name#
There are basic courses for each civil service subject #@affiliation#
Are you talking about basic courses for each subject?
Yes, but does the lecture content change every year?
Usually, in the case of common subjects such as Korean, English, and Korean history,
Since the revisions are not significant, it is okay to use the existing lectures.
In the case of major subjects or law-related subjects
In that case, the revisions are big and important.
We recommend that you utilize the latest basic lectures.
It would be best to just use the latest lectures, regardless of the subject, if possible.
There are many cases where you read the textbook after reading the lecture.
Yes, thank you for explaining it in detail.
Have a nice day, this was counselor #@name#
Happy day start #@Affiliation# Counselor #@Name#
Due to circumstances, I can't attend the lecture in person, so I'm going to study through online lectures.

Okay, I'll think about it and get back to you.

Is it true that the elective subject system for administrative law and administrative science will disappear from 2022?
Yes, as you mentioned in 2022, the civil service examination is being reformed.
In the case of learning content, there are cases where it is revised little by little.

So, I recommend that you purchase the 22-year basic book and study it.
Yes, thank you. I understand.

I have a question about the internship
What are you curious about in your internship?
I applied for the practical course and registered.
It's difficult to find an internship place because they are not accepting outsiders due to the current coronavirus.
Are you having trouble finding a place to practice?
Yes, what happens if I can't find an internship by the OT date?
If you can fill the practical training hours after OT, you can proceed by choosing a practical training institution.
Do you know how long after OT
Because of the special circumstances due to Corona, we have set it to 3 months after OT.
I think you'll be able to get it in 3 months
If you have any further questions, please contact the department where you will be doing your internship.
Yes, I understand. Thank you.
Yes, thank you #@Affiliation# Counselor #@Name#
I am #@Affiliation# counselor #@Name#, full of happiness.
I would like to inquire about credits.
What part of your grades are you curious about?
It says that if you transfer and do a double major, you have to complete 36 credits.
Do I have to take all 36 credits of major courses?
I think the question you asked is about double majors.
There is no change to the 48 credits for the major, and for a double major, 36 credits must be completed in major subjects to be recognized.
How many credits are allowed for duplicate recognition?
Please note that up to 18 credits can be recognized as duplicate credits.
For more detailed information, please contact us when applying for a double major after admission.
Okay, thanks for letting me know.
Yes, thank you #@Affiliation# Counselor #@Name#
I am #@Affiliation# counselor #@Name#, full of happiness.
I would like to inquire about social work internship.
Yes, what is your inquiry?
It says that 3 face-to-face seminars are mandatory.
Is it possible for students from other regions to do it non-face-to-face?
For other regions, the seminar schedule will be announced later.
Can you tell me when the schedule will be released?
Due to the ongoing COVID-19 situation, the form and schedule of the seminar have not been determined and we ask for your understanding as we cannot provide any information.
Yes, so if I don't attend the seminar, I get an F grade?
3 face-to-face seminars are mandatory and failure to do so will result in an F grade.
Yes, I see. I understand.
Yes, have a nice day #@Affiliation# Counselor #@Name#
Hello, this is counselor #@name# from #@affiliation#
I would like to inquire about credits.
Yes, please let me know if you have any questions.
The maximum number of credits you can take per semester is 18.
If I take a minor, can I take more than 18 credits?
Even if you have a minor or double major, the regular semester is designated as 18 credits.
So, what is the maximum number of credits per semester?
The maximum number of credits per semester is 6
Will the number of credits earned be the same each semester?
24 credits each for the first semester and summer semester, and 24 credits each for the second semester and winter semester.
Because the maximum number of credits that can be earned per year is 48 credits.
Even if you have a minor or double major, you cannot take more credits than the above.

Among the schools you looked into during the internship period, you connected #@Other#
I didn't receive my graduation letter and didn't receive my certificate.

I have a question about the lecture
Yes, what are you curious about?
Looking at the curriculum, the number of courses offered per semester is different.
Then when you transfer to the third year
If there are 4 courses offered in the first semester of the third year, do I have to take all 4?
You don't have to listen to all four
Then, when registering for classes, can I take any of the open courses regardless of grade level, as long as I meet the credit requirements?
In the case of transfer to the third year, practical subjects are excluded.
Regardless of your grade, you can apply for any course offered when applying for classes.
Then I guess I just need to take classes that match my major credits.
Yes, if you transfer to the third year, if your major subjects are the same major.
If you have a similar major with more than 24 credits, you only need to take 36 credits or more.
Yes, I understand. Thank you.

I would like to inquire about the Department of Pediatrics
Yes, what are you curious about?
I am graduating this year and majoring in lifelong education, so I am working at a daycare center.
I think I need to have a child studies degree, so I'm curious about how to get a child studies degree.
To obtain a bachelor's degree in child care
You must transfer to the third year of our school and complete 70 credits.
Will overlapping courses be recognized in lifelong education?
In the case of overlapping subjects, credits are recognized, so you do not have to take the same or similar subjects.
That's fortunate because I don't have to listen to it separately.
For any other inquiries regarding admissions, please contact the Admissions Office by phone.
Yes, I see. I understand.

The subjects listed on the submitted transcript
If the courses offered by our school are similar or identical, you do not have to take them.

Are all college credits recognized?

I would like to inquire about transfer to the Department of Health Administration.
Yes, what are you curious about?
I graduated from another university's Department of Tourism Management in 2012 and I'm planning to transfer to my third year.
I think there is a discount for graduates of the school I went to, but how much is the tuition each semester?
Tuition is set at 70,000 won per credit.
You can register for up to 18 credits per semester.
It costs 70,000 won per credit, so if I take the maximum number of classes, it would be 1.26 million won, right?
Yes, that's the amount you told me.
Another thing I'm curious about is, even if it's a cyber class, do I have to visit the school for the midterm and final exams?
Both midterm and final exams will be conducted online.
Okay, so do I have to do an internship to graduate?
The practical course is an elective course, so you can take it or not.

I want to know about part-time students
Yes, what part are you curious about?
I know they are announcing the student number today, but I want to know what time they will send the text message and make the announcement.
Since my student number doesn't come out quickly, it's difficult to submit documents to the internship center.
The student number will be issued on August 30th, not today.
I thought it was today, but it wasn't

I am a public servant living in Gumi.
Yes, how may I help you?
I'm really in a hurry. Is there any kind of civil servant interview program that I can do for just one week?
Civil service interviews are often conducted online rather than offline.
It's hard to find proper interview classes in the countryside.
We recommend free lectures for each interview series on our site.
Oh, I think I heard this while preparing for the instructor's interview.
Yes, 2 out of 3 students who passed our #@affiliation# program are this person's students.
You are always our #@affiliation# interview 1st round instructor
It would be convenient to prepare online in many ways. Thank you.

I'm trying to study for the 9th level civil service exam.
I think it will be difficult this year due to circumstances, so I plan to take the exam next year.
Oh, yes, please speak comfortably.
Then, if I want to buy the #@affiliation# textbook, should I buy it this year and study?
Basically, the system and exam trends change slightly every year.
#@Affiliation# It is recommended to study using the latest textbooks.
I don't think things like Korean and English really matter
In the case of Korean history, there is no significant difference.
The revised content is clearly explained by the teacher, so you can use last year's textbook.
Yes, thank you for checking.

How difficult is the civil service English test?
Are you looking into preparing for the civil service exam?
Yes, but I don't even have the basics right now, so I don't know how to prepare.
There are many opinions that the civil service English test is similar in difficulty to the CSAT or a little more difficult.
I recommend the #@Affiliation# English Basic Program because the vocabulary words that come out well are different.
Is there a separate program for people preparing for the civil service exam for the first time?
Currently, #@affiliation# is offering a free study session for one week.
Oh, then it might be helpful to listen to it once.
Do you have any further questions?
No, thank you. Thank you for your hard work.

I'm watching the punch needle lecture
Yes, do you have any questions?
Is it possible to make a large rug using the techniques learned in class?
Yes, originally, it was only possible to do work that fit the frame size.
If you want to make a large rug, you need a large frame that fits the size.
Can't we do it without a big picture?
The result of working in a small size is like a module.
You can also make a rug of any size you want using the connecting method.
Do you teach this method in class too?
We'll teach you how in your classes, and you can also purchase an additional rug-making kit.
Yes, I understand. Thank you.

I'm taking a punch needle class and I have a question.
Yes, what are you curious about?
Is it possible to texture it like a tufting gun?
Yes, of course you can.
Could you please explain how this is possible?
Yes, the two tools have the same principle.
The only difference is that it is manual and electric.
Oh, then the feeling would be similar.
Yes, using a punch needle is better than using an electric tufting gun.
It takes some time, but it can produce the same effect.
Okay, I guess I'll have to try it even if it takes a little longer. Okay.

I'm trying knitting needles for the first time. Can a beginner knit socks?
Even for those who are just starting out with four-needle knitting.
We are making it possible for you to learn how to knit socks step by step.
Yeah, what do you learn first?
I am learning how to make a starting stitch, as well as how to knit, purl, flat, and circular knit.
After building a solid foundation by looking at samples, start knitting socks.
Can I learn properly through online classes?
Yes, please see the descriptive diagram and video together.
We are providing feedback through comments so that you can gradually complete the socks.

Yes, what are you curious about?
How many works can I complete in total by taking your course?
The course you are currently viewing allows you to complete a total of 7 works.
So how long does it take for each piece?
Because it is knitted by hand, it takes about 1 to 2 hours.
For cushions, it takes about 2 to 3 hours per item.
Oh, I see. It takes longer than I thought.
Please note that progress speed may vary depending on the individual.
Okay, I understand. Thank you.

What would you say about the additional opening process?
I'm looking at the upcoming menu on the homepage.
The open schedule menu on the homepage is for recruiting lectures.
This is a process that can only be held when a certain number of people gather.
Then there is no additional opening process?
There are new courses opening continuously.
You need to keep checking the number of people gathering.
Oh, then I don't know exactly when it will open
Yes, because if four people don't show up, it will be cancelled.

Yes, hello. I have a question about the civil service exam curriculum.
Yes, how may I help you?
Is the civil service exam changing like the high school curriculum?
Yes, all civil service subjects are revised slightly every year according to the revisions.
Well, then I took the Korean language class last year. Do I have to take it again this year?
In the case of common subjects such as Korean, English, and Korean history, there are not many major revisions.
In the case of administrative law and administrative science, there may be many revisions.
Oh, I guess it varies a bit depending on the subject.
Yes, but I think it would be helpful to take the course again this year.
Yes, thank you for explaining it in detail.
Thank you #@Affiliation# #@Name#
I am #@Affiliation# counselor #@Name#, full of happiness.
I am a first-time examinee preparing for the 9th level civil service exam in computer science.
I'm planning to start taking classes with a free pass starting in July.
Yes, thank you for your interest in our #@affiliation# free pass program.
Which course in Korean history would be best to start early?
First of all, in the case of Korean and English, there is a lot of content that needs to be memorized every day.
I think you need Korean vocabulary and Chinese characters the most.
Oh, then it would be good to prepare for the Korean vocabulary course in advance.
Yes, many students use apps or memorization books in parallel for Chinese characters.
I think it would be good to prepare in advance so that you can study continuously.
Yes, thank you for explaining it in detail.

All information, from test procedures to welfare, is conveniently organized, so it will be helpful.
Well, that would actually help me decide which series to choose.
If you tell me your phone number, I will send you the link to our beginner's guide.

What are the differences between the civil service exam and the military service exam?
#@Affiliation# I'm trying to register for a class, but I want to know what the test characteristics are.
Yes, sir, the administrative law and administrative department of the 9th grade civil servant administrative position are the same as the military administrative position.
Is there anything else you would like to add to the military service administrative law lecture?
Yes, general and specific administrative law will be added.
So, which lecture would be helpful to start with?
If you are short on time, it might be okay to just take the general theory class.
If you have time, it would be good to listen to the detailed explanations.
Yes, thank you. I understand.
Thank you #@Affiliation# #@Name#
Yes, I will hang up. Thank you for your hard work.
I am #@Affiliation# counselor #@Name#, full of joy
Yes, I am a student taking classes at #@affiliation#
Yes sir, how may I help you?
The instructor doesn't write on the board at all during the lecture and just explains things.
I don't know what you're talking about, and the book is so thick, do I have to memorize everything?
As you know, the amount of studying required for the civil service exam is enormous.
Yeah, it would be nice to memorize everything, but that's almost impossible.
Yes, so I recommend studying mainly the parts that our instructor points out.
#@Affiliation# Teachers mainly explain the content that is likely to appear on the exam
Please pay attention
Yes, so you can study more efficiently.

I haven't passed the written exam yet
The interview is 11 days after the written exam results are released. Is it okay to prepare for the interview after passing the written exam?
Civil service exam interviews are often prepared immediately after the written exam.
Well, I'm worried because the written test results haven't come out yet.
In that case, we recommend our #@affiliation# full service of passing the exam.
Ah, can I check in advance whether I can pass this program?
Yes, because we can accurately predict passing through big data from many samples.
You can prepare for the next step faster
Yes, then I guess I'll have to check it out with the full service of #@affiliation# passing prediction.

Can you recommend a Korean history teacher or textbook for a 9th grade civil servant?
Yes, is this your first time looking into the civil service exam?
Yes, I don't know which teacher would be good because I lack basic skills.
For the Korean history subject, I recommend teacher #@Affiliation# #@Name#
#@Name# What are the good points about the teacher's lecture?
The teacher's lecture style is suitable for the exam.
Since you only talk about exam-related topics, you can focus more on the exam.
Oh, if you're that kind of person, you could probably reduce the amount of studying you do.
Yes, I recommend you to take a taster class from #@name# teacher.
Okay, I understand. Thank you for your hard work.
Thank you #@Affiliation# #@Name#

Yes, you should think about your civil service exam preparation life as lasting about 1 to 2 years on average.
Well, my goal is to pass the exam within a year.
In that case, it is important to minimize trial and error.
We recommend the most popular #@products#
Is there a separate program for passing the first exam?
Yes, it is possible to learn how to reduce the quantity and increase the density of #@product#
Yeah, that was the kind of program I wanted.
Do you need any other program recommendations?
No, thank you. Thank you for your hard work.
Yes, this was counselor #@name#
I am #@Affiliation# counselor #@Name#, full of happiness.
Yes, hello. I have a question about the program.
Yes, how may I help you?
Is there any free pass for one subject in #@affiliation#?
There is no one-subject free pass for our #@affiliation#
It is possible to purchase a single subject course
Are most of the actual students taking the course using the free pass?
Yes, you are not trying to divide the instructors by company, are you?
No, that's not what I was trying to say.
In that case, of course, the free pass has a lot of merit in terms of price.
Okay, I'll think about it and get back to you.
Thank you #@Affiliation# #@Name#
It's a sunny morning. This is #@Affiliation# Counselor #@Name#
Should I wait until July to purchase the 2022 course?
I think it's important for you to think about the progress you're currently making.
Or would it be better to start taking the 21st year lectures right now?
It is right to prepare in advance for subjects that require a lot of memorization and daily study.
There is a possibility that subjects that are related to the 2022 reorganization will change.
I guess it would be right to prepare the lecture after July.
Yes, if there is no actual reorganization issue.
Most people will not have much trouble even if they listen to the previous lectures.
Then, as you said, I should prepare in advance from Korean, English, and Korean history.
Thank you #@Affiliation# #@Name#
Yes, I will hang up. Thank you for your hard work.
Hello, this is counselor #@name# from #@affiliation# who answered the phone.
I was preparing to become a civil servant, but I am thinking of changing my career path to become a military officer.
I'm taking #@Name# Administrative Law #@Name# Administrative Studies #@Name# Korean because I got a free pass
Yes sir, how may I help you?
Can I listen to these lecturers' lectures while preparing for the military service exam?
Yes, many people prepare for both civil service and military service at the same time.
Since the subjects are the same, I think it would be a good idea to prepare together with the lecture you mentioned.
There is no need to buy a separate #@affiliation# free pass.
Yes, if you are using the #@affiliation# free pass, you do not need to purchase it separately.
Yes, thank you. I understand.
Thank you #@Affiliation# #@Name#
have a good day
Hello, I am a counselor from #@Affiliation# Customer Satisfaction Center #@Name#
Yes, hello. I have a question about the lecture.
Yes, how may I help you?
I'm trying to become a prosecutor, but if it doesn't work out, I'm going to return to my group.
Is it possible to take criminal law and criminal procedure law classes at #@affiliation#?
Yes, we recommend our #@affiliation# #@product#
Are criminal law and criminal procedure law lectures included?
Yes, you can take up to 56 series and unlimited series classes.
Well, then I guess there's no need to sign up for a separate #@affiliation# free pass.
Yes, it is all covered by the free pass program I mentioned.
Okay, I'll think about it and get back to you.
Yes, this was counselor #@name#
We will serve you with the best service. #@Affiliation# Counselor #@Name#
I'm a first-time student. Which professor is better for administrative law among #@name# and #@name#?
Yes, did you check out the instructor's reviews first?
Yes, there are so many professors with #@name# in the reviews.
#@Name# Professor, you haven't been here long at #@Affiliation# so there aren't many reviews.
Yes, I think so, but I don't know what to refer to.
It's hard for us to say which instructor is better.
Because the choice varies depending on the students' style.
Well, since I have a free pass, I guess I'll just listen to both of your lectures.
Both are good enough instructors with high recognition.
Okay, okay, I understand.
Have a nice day, this was counselor #@name#
I'll help you with anything #@Affiliation# Counselor #@Name#
Yes, hello #@Affiliation# I have a question about the lecture
Oh yes please tell me
#@Affiliation# There is an all-in-one lecture in English
What can I study in the all-in-one lecture?
The all-in-one course you mentioned is usually a course to review the basics when starting out.
So is the all-in-one lecture book the basic book?
Yes, you can think of the all-in-one lecture book as a basic book.
Well, then I guess I should listen to this lecture first.
Yes, I hope you get good results.
Yes, thank you for checking.
Yes, this was counselor #@name#
Start a happy day #@Affiliation# Counselor #@Name#
Yes, hello. I have a question about the Korean history lecture.
Yes, how may I help you?
I heard that teacher #@name# from #@affiliation# will be canceling the class.
Can I still listen to the previous lectures?
Yes, sir. What year of lecture are you referring to?
Yes, #@name# teacher, this is the 2020 lecture.
Yes, the 2020 lecture you mentioned is available until 2026.
Hmm, I guess I'll have to go to the #@affiliation# website and check.
If you have a free pass, I recommend that you also take classes taught by other history professors.
Yes, thank you for explaining it in detail.
Thank you #@Affiliation# #@Name#
Good morning #@Affiliation# Counselor #@Name#
I'm trying to pay for #@Affiliation# #@Product#

But the course period renewal page is said to open in November
Yes, our free pass course period is from the course registration date to December 31st of the following year.
Oh, so if I buy it now, the expiration date is December 31st next year?
Yes, so you can apply for renewal in November next year.
It seems like it would be possible to take classes without any special rainy periods.

Yes, please tell me what you are curious about.
I'm watching a home training class. Is it possible for someone in their 60s?
Have you ever tried home training before?
No, I've only tried walking exercises in general.
In the case of home training, we teach you from the basics and also teach you movements for beginners.
You will have no trouble following the curriculum.
I'm really lacking in basic physical strength. Will that be okay?
It is not recommended to perform a high-difficulty program before increasing your base fitness.
I think it would be okay to start slowly with the basics and build up your stamina.
Yes, I see. I understand.

I'm thinking about taking a workout class and I have a question.
Yes, please tell me what you are curious about.
I'm thinking about starting a home workout, but would it be helpful for men to take the class?
Home training is a class designed for people who want to become healthy through exercise, regardless of gender.
I want to start with home training because I lack basic physical strength, but many women do it.
This is an exercise you can do at home.
Because it consists of various programs that use all the muscles of the body, from the core.
I think it will definitely help you
Well then I guess I'll have to try it
Before increasing your basic stamina
I do not recommend performing high-difficulty programs, so I recommend starting from the basics.
Yes, I see. I understand.

I'm watching a 3D related course and I have a question.
Yes, what are you curious about?
I don't know anything about 3D, can I still take the course?
Dear Customer, can you tell me which course you are watching?
Yes, it is #@product#
Yes, that lecture is for those who have always been interested in 3D but haven't started yet.
But you were using another 3D program
Unreal Engine is designed to be accessible to anyone who is new to it.
Wouldn't it be very difficult?
Because of the nature of the game engine, you can move it and experience it yourself.
The curriculum will help you learn the concepts of 3D in an easy and stress-free way.
Okay, I'll think about it a little more and come back.
Yes, thank you #@Affiliation# Counselor #@Name#
Hello, this is counselor #@name# from #@affiliation#
I'm watching a course related to video editing.
I'm curious about the level of difficulty of the lecture.
Yes, could you tell me the name of the lecture you are taking?
Yes, it is #@product#
For that course, this is the recommended difficulty level for those who have been working on effects for at least 1 to 3 months.
I've tried using it a little bit in practice, but is 3D similar in difficulty?
I think you'll be able to do it without any problems if you try it in your practice.
For a more complete quality, it would be better to look at the curriculum and decide on the course.
Yes, I understand. Thank you.

Yes, what are you curious about?
I have a separate job so I don't have time. Is that possible?
Yes, I have a separate job, so I only need to invest time when I first create a document.
How long will it take to get started?
Yes, it takes about two weeks at first.
Once you get better at it, you can do it even during the weekends.
How much time is 2 weeks?
Yes, for e-books that are generally sold, we use 100 pages as the standard.
Oh, I see. There are more than I thought. Okay.

It focuses on correcting your body shape while sweating profusely.
It consists of a systematic exercise curriculum centered on the spine.
What is the intensity of the exercise?

I am #@Affiliation# counselor #@Name#, full of happiness.
I'm watching a lecture on making apps and I have a question.
Yes, please tell me what you are curious about.
Can you make both iPhone and Android apps?
Yes, you can create both iPhone and Android apps on your Mac OS computer.
What should I do if I don't use a Mac computer?
If you use the Windows operating system, you can only create Android apps.
Okay, so there's a to-do list and writing app in the curriculum.
Are those two apps the only ones you can make?
Yes, we've chosen the two types of apps that most people want to make through our survey.
Oh, I see. Okay, I understand.

Yes, I have a question about #@product#
Yes, what are you curious about?
Yes, can a child who doesn't speak English take the class?
Yes, my teacher has taught for many years from infants to elementary school.
You explain things in an easy and convenient way based on your teaching experience.
Because we have organized easy and fun crafts for each topic.
You can enjoy it at your own level, from beginner to intermediate to advanced English learners.
I see. I'm worried whether the kids will understand it well.
It consists of words that are easier for children than you might think.
It's about easy and difficult words for children.
I think you'll understand it quickly because the range of acceptance is wide.
Yeah, I guess I'll have to listen to it once.

Yes, what are you curious about?
Yes, my child is trying to do it, so I'm wondering if it's difficult.
How old are your children?
I have two children, ages 7 and 9.
This course is structured so that even children under 10 years old can easily follow along.
If you are familiar with mobile devices and are comfortable with a touch pen, you will do better.
Yes, I see. I understand.
Yes, do you have any further questions?
No, I have no questions.

Yes, I have a question.
Yes, what are you curious about?
Yes, I am taking a Korean history class.
Is it possible to take the class without ever being exposed to Korean history?
Yes, even if you are learning Korean history for the first time, we are helping you understand it easily through artifacts and culture.
You can learn the flow of history through fun storytelling that is not stiff.
Oh, I see. Then is it okay if I don't have a separate book?
Yes, it would be better if you had a Korean history book, but you can take the class with just the worksheets.
Yes, I see. I understand.

Yes, what are you talking about?
I'm watching a lecture on colors.
How is it different from art class?
Yes, in art or craft classes, you may be wondering how to best express your work.
I'm learning skills and how to use tools.
The color class is all about color.
You will learn how to see, divide, and organize accurately.
Okay, so what good is learning colors?
Because your colors are used in various places
Not only designers but also paperwork
You can develop your sense when choosing interior wallpaper, etc.
Oh, it can be applied to various places.
Yes, if you learn colors, you will see more colors.
It opens up opportunities to develop and broaden your senses.
Okay, I understand. I'll have to look into it a little more.

I'm watching the English class for infants and toddlers and I have a question.
Yes, sir, what part are you curious about?
In your introduction, it says that you can read the alphabet sounds in 27 days. Is that true?
Yes, you can read all 26 alphabet sounds before you turn one month old.
Won't the kids get distracted or bored?
Yes, proactive learning has not been embodied yet.
Older children may become distracted when trying to learn by looking at unfamiliar letters.
A method of learning through the right brain, which innately processes images.
We conduct the curriculum so that it remains as an image in the children's minds.
So when will reading be possible?
It is possible after learning the method and principle of pronouncing the alphabet sounds and building basic skills.
Yes, I see. I understand.

The class I took before has a second version, and I'm curious about how it differs from the previous one.
Yes sir, can you tell me the name of the class you took before?
Yes, it is a #@product# class
Yes, the first class is an offline class taught by the author.
Because I gathered the dolls I had made and taught them.
This second round is better than the last one
We are conducting classes by creating a curriculum with slightly more difficult dolls.
Yeah, there was that kind of difference.
Yes, I designed the diagram to make it as easy as possible, just like before.
I think that even those who found the first class difficult will be able to build a solid foundation.

Is it only possible for children under 36 months?
Because we are learning about your development, children over 36 months old are tested.

If you can draw with scissors to some extent on your own, that's fine.
Okay, so how much English do I have to know to be able to listen to it?
Yes, all classes are taught in English, but the important part is
You don't have to worry too much because it includes Korean subtitles.

This is the representative #@affiliation# hacker counselor in Korea, #@name#
Yes, I would like to get some advice.
Yes, what is your inquiry?
My child wants to learn the violin, but it's his first time.
The lecture will proceed through the music score notebook that the author himself created.
This is a course that slowly teaches you basic scales and rhythms.
I can't read sheet music at all. Is that okay?
As I said before, build up your basics
You don't have to worry because I will teach you each and every piece when you learn the piece.
I heard that it's hard to master the basics of violin. Can I learn it properly by following along?
It's not easy compared to other instruments.
I will introduce you to ways to relieve unnecessary strength and hold the bow comfortably, so you will be able to learn well.
Yes, I'll think about it some more. Thank you.

Yes, sir, do you have any questions?
Yes, I saw that you used an iPhone in the video I found. Do I really need to have an iPhone?
Because most smartphones these days have excellent camera performance.
I don't think the brand or model matters much.
Then it doesn't necessarily have to be an iPhone.
Yes, that's right. In this lecture, we will teach you the know-how to create great results regardless of the model.
Yes, then can you also teach me how to shoot a video and use a video editing program?
Yes, I am only informing you about the tools you need.

Yes, if you have a camera that you used before, you can definitely take good pictures of people.
Yes, is there any difference from the photos I took before?
Yes, because it is a field where people meet people, unlike landscapes or still life photography.
In addition to camera operation, communication with the characters is important.

I'm worried that I won't be able to make a proper video because I lack the sense and sensibility.
Your video editing skills won't improve overnight.
If you start with cut editing and build up steadily one by one, you can create a sophisticated video.
There seems to be so much to learn in video editing, but isn't it difficult?
Yes, it's not easy to remember all those buttons and function shortcuts at once.
In each class, we review what we have learned previously.
Yeah, that would be easier.
Yes, you can improve your skills by learning them one by one without difficulty.
Okay, I'll have to try it. Okay.

I am giving a lecture on how to operate in manual mode.
What is manual mode operation?
I'm talking about the PSAM mode on your camera.
Operates automatically and manually
Does the type of lens matter?
Yes, that's right. Lenses are something that each person has their own preferences.
First of all, since it has a wide angle of view, it is good to have a lens that can zoom in to take pictures of various angles.

We are teaching you how to use it in more depth through lectures.
Yes, I can handle my camera to some extent, so I'm a little worried.

I assume you have little basic knowledge of color correction, so I will explain it to you step by step.
Do you need a video of yourself taking your class?
There is no problem taking the class even if there is no video.

How is a music video production class structured?
It consists of four stages: planning, directing, shooting, and editing.
What's in your plan?

Then organize your ideas and create a storyboard.
Isn't it difficult to make a storyboard?
Yes, it is not difficult because I am referring to pictorials, YouTube, web dramas, etc.
Okay, I see. So what kind of content is included in the filming?
It consists of a shooting method using the three exposure elements and understanding color temperature shot lighting.
Yes, I see. I understand.

Do I need any supplies to dance?
Yes, please bring water or a beverage to drink during class and wear comfortable clothes.
Is there a way to know if you are doing the movements correctly during your class?
Yes, beginners, from the beginning, rather than worrying about the accuracy of movements such as right or wrong,
I recommend that you practice focusing more on the feeling and movement characteristics that the choreographer talks about.
Yes, I see. I understand.
Yes, it was #@Affiliation# counselor #@Name#

Yes, this is a #@product# lecture
Four popular choreographers, starting with the basic movements.
It is structured as a runner class that starts step by step and a master class that applies the movement.
Yes, I'm worried if I can follow along well since it's an online class.
A couple that I couldn't keep up with in online classes
Because you can follow along again by setting the interval.
You can practice anytime, anywhere, at any time you want.

Yes, I will start by practicing drawing lines and teach you how to color them.
I'll have to watch your lecture again and try it out.

I'm sure you'll have no trouble understanding my lessons.
Yes, so is there a gender restriction for the class?
There is no gender restriction
Because offline classes involve group work together
It was run as a women-only program.
Oh, I see. Will you feel better after taking the class?
Yes, please concentrate and be serious in the quietest place possible.
I think you will feel a big change as you take the class.
Yes, I see. I understand.
Yes, thank you #@Affiliation# Counselor #@Name#
Nice to meet you, I am #@Affiliation#, counselor #@Name#
I'm watching the diet lecture and I have a question.
Yes, what are you curious about?
Yes, I am looking at #@product#
How is it different from other lectures?
Yes, I don't eat and I exercise like crazy.
This is a lecture that teaches you a diet that is not a temporary diet but one that you can easily follow for life.
Does it include diet menu information?
No, I am sharing that you can lose weight without dieting or exercising too much.
Is that possible
Yes, those of you who are tired of the repetitive dieting.
Or, there are many people who want to succeed in a healthy diet without yo-yoing.
I see there are various methods for dieting. Okay.
Yes, have a nice day #@Affiliation# This was counselor #@Name#
It's a sunny morning. This is #@Affiliation# Counselor #@Name#
I'm interested in Tarot lessons, what is #@product#?
Yes, these are tarot cards made in Italy.
When can I start consulting after taking the lecture?
If you listen from the beginning of the class, you can start light consulting right away.
Can I see my personal tarot?
By learning the skills for your general meaning and perspective.
You can fully consult about your personal worries, concerns, and choices.
Yeah, but wouldn't that be a lot to memorize?
Yes, of course there are many
How much will I have to memorize?
78 cards and the meaning of each card, etc.
There are so many that we help you learn Tarot efficiently through associative memory.
Oh, I see. Okay, I understand.
Yes, have a nice day #@Affiliation# Counselor #@Name#
Happy day start #@Affiliation# Counselor #@Name#
I was watching the lecture and it was uploaded along with YouTube, what is the difference?
Yes, could you tell me the name of the lecture you are taking?
Yes, this is a #@product# lecture
The big difference between your lectures and the videos posted on YouTube is their popularity.
What do you mean by popularity?
Because the YouTube platform talks about topics that most people can relate to.
It's not easy to say something important
#@Affiliation# is different in that it completely incorporates the valuable lessons learned through experience.
So, will anything change if I take that class?
As we live, we also learn through direct experience.
Because we learn through experiences other than books and lectures.
You can think of the students as being responsible for the changes that follow.
Oh, I see. Okay, I understand.
Yes, thank you #@Affiliation# Counselor #@Name#
This is #@Affiliation#, the representative domestic education counselor #@Name#
I'm trying to take the #@product# class. Can someone who is new to dancing also take it?
Yes, I think the basics class is the best for someone who is just starting out dancing.
Do I need to learn the basics?
Just like when you build a building, the frame is the most important thing.
I think you can think of it as the foundation for creating your own dance.
Yeah, isn't that too difficult?
As with all fields, it is simple, but the basics are the most difficult.
Slowly and carefully, in detail, and in areas where mistakes can be made.
We are proceeding meticulously without missing anything.
Oh, I see. Okay, I understand.
Yes, thank you #@Affiliation# Counselor #@Name#
This is the largest #@affiliation# counselor in the country, #@name#. How may I help you?
I'm watching a tutorial on making homemade dog treats.
Yes, what are you curious about?
Are there any dry snacks?
It's different for each class, but what are you looking at?
Yes, #@product#
Yes, in that case, the class is focused on baking.
Oh, I see. So do you have any snacks for dogs with allergies?
Yes, can you tell me what kind of allergy it is?
Yes, I have a meat allergy.
We also have snacks available for dogs with meat allergies.
Oh good, I understand
Yes, thank you #@Affiliation# Counselor #@Name#

What are the advantages compared to existing diaries?
Yes, usually diaries have limited space for writing on each day.
#@Product# is written in a blank note
The biggest advantage is that you can write as many pages as you want per day.
Yes, it's hard to keep track of things, but can you do it?
Yes, if you keep using it, you will get used to it and be able to use it well.
There is also a writing challenge at the end of the curriculum.
I think it will be easier to form a habit
Is it okay if I don't write well?
Yes, if you develop the habit of writing and spend more time writing, your handwriting will naturally become neater.
Okay, I understand. I'll have to give it a try.

Can taking a class help me break free from compulsive eating?
#@Product# is a lecture optimized for those who are struggling with eating disorders and want to solve their problems and regain psychological comfort.
Should I increase my exercise intensity after overcoming my compulsive eating disorder?
If you feel that the exercise intensity is weak, 80% of the time it is due to a lack of accuracy and you do not feel the stimulation.
You can follow along according to your physical strength through the review and difficulty adjustment guide.
How much review is good?
I recommend that you do it without pressure or burden.
Yes, I understand. Thank you.

Can parents do home pilates at their age?
Yes, as you get older, home Pilates are more suitable than strenuous strength training.
I want to recommend some exercise to my parents. Are there any good ones?
Yes, I recommend circuit training over strength training.
Is there anything else you recommend besides circuit training?
I recommend classes on spine stretching and core strengthening exercises of this level of difficulty.
Please note that challenges that require a lot of aerobic exercise or physical strength may be a bit difficult.
Yes, even if it's your first time, you'll be able to follow along well.
Yes, if you do it slowly and repeatedly and practice, it is definitely possible.
Yes, I understand. Thank you.

I'm looking at #@Product# and I have a question
Yes, what are you curious about?
This is my first time doing ballet and my body is very stiff. Can I do it?
Yes, even beginners can follow along easily.
Because it includes stretching
Even those with limited flexibility can exercise after sufficient relaxation.
You won't have any pain in your back, shoulders, or knees, right?
If you have simple pain, you can proceed with exercise with caution.
Yeah, I guess I'll have to make sure you don't get hurt.
If you have any medical conditions, please consult your doctor before exercising.
Yes, I understand. Thank you.
Yes, thank you #@Affiliation# Counselor #@Name#
I am #@Affiliation# counselor #@Name#, full of joy
I'm taking #@Product# but it's so hard
In the case of your chair, it is a device that uses all of the muscles of the whole body.
You may find it very difficult at first.
Yes, it's hard and I'm not sure if I'm doing the movements correctly.
Yes, in that case, I recommend exercising while looking in the mirror.
Yeah, would that be better?
If you feel strength in the stimulation points from the lecture
Even if the shape of the movement isn't perfect, you're doing well, so don't worry.
I guess I'll have to try it while looking in the mirror first.
If you repeat it often, you will feel that the difficult movements become easier.
Oh, I see. Okay, I understand.
Have a nice day #@Affiliation# Counselor #@Name#
Nice to meet you, I am #@Affiliation#, counselor #@Name#
I'm curious about the level of #@Product#
We will cover everything from beginner to advanced level with the first online #@product# in Korea.
So if I take the class, will I be able to play well?
The amount of practice students get is very important.
How much practice should I do?
I recommend that you study the explanations and demonstrations introduced in class repeatedly and practice for 30 minutes every day.
Can I get a full refund if I take all the classes?
By the end of the course, you will have mastered all the sample songs and will be able to confidently play even the first sheet music you see.
Yes, I understand. Thank you.

I'm interested in #@Product# and I'm looking at it
Can I compose a design even if I can't draw?
#@Product# I like drawings with simple lines and not complicated shapes.
It's a good idea to start with simple shapes like squares, triangles, and circles.
It looks easy, but can you do it well?
It looks simple and easy, but the finished product is amazing, so I think it's worth a try.
Is there a way to view the design?
There is no way to see the pattern and there are not many types of stitches to learn.
If you just learn a few stitches and finishing techniques,
You can make props as you wish and as you want.
Yes, I see. I understand.
Yes, have a nice day #@Affiliation# This was counselor #@Name#

You can also create your own tablet with your own design.
Then can I gift the tablet to someone I know?
Yes, of course it is possible.
How long does the scent last?
On average, it lasts from 3 to 6 months.
Yes, I see. I understand.

I want to know the resin accessory curriculum
Is there a class that interests you?
Yes, it is #@product#
It consists of resin accessories made with four mold frames, and there are also resin accessories made without frames.
What can you make with molds?
Includes pressed glitter ring and pearl holographic pin
What kind of frames are there?
Yes, I have an antique simple clear necklace and a marble bracelet.

I have a question about resin art
Yes, please tell me what you are curious about.
I'm new to crafts. Will I be able to complete the piece well?
Resin is not difficult to get started with.
You can make props as you wish and as you want.
Let's start from the basics so that you can digest it step by step.
It is composed of curricula, so you can easily follow the lectures.
Yes, I see. Resin is safe, right?
We only have classes made up of resins that have passed both self-inspection and heavy metal detection tests.
In the lecture, we also provide detailed information on precautions when using resin.
Yes, I understand. Thank you.

Yes, sir, what is your inquiry?
I'm trying color matching for the first time. Is it going well?
You can knit it because you practiced with a pouch first.
Maybe it's because it's my first time doing it, but the color combination isn't that pretty.
The more you practice color matching, the prettier it becomes.
Even if your first piece comes out a little awkward, I recommend that you keep practicing.
Can I arrange the colors differently from the lecture?
Yes, of course. You can color it in the colors you have, and you can do it crosswise like coloring.
Yes, I understand. Thank you.

I have a question about #@Product#
Yes, what are you curious about?
I heard it's made with air dry clay, what is that?
A general term for clay that dries in the air without using energy such as fire, oven, or microwave.
Then wouldn't it break easily?
It is durable and does not break easily even when dropped, as it is dried firmly and solidly through the air.
Is it similar to branch clay?
Similar but different in that it is a clay that dries naturally
Yes, I see. I understand.

I'm interested in steering, but won't the lecture be difficult?
It is not difficult because I will teach you in a way that even beginners can easily learn and apply.
If I take the class, can I make the same perfume as the one sold?
It is difficult to make something exactly like a perfume that is already on the market.
Instead, kits and curricula are designed to help you create a variety of perfumes through classes.
Can I give away or sell my own perfume?
Perfumes made through classes cannot be given as gifts or sold.
Why doesn't it work?
Legal procedures such as approval and certification from the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety and the Ministry of Environment are required.
Yes, I understand. Thank you.

Is it only possible in a private room?
No, all threads are possible
Yes, then is regular knitting yarn possible?
Yes, you can use regular knitting yarn.
However, since it may be difficult to work with depending on the thickness of the vertical thread, I think it would be better to use cotton yarn that does not stretch at first.
Then can you make a laptop case too?
It is possible if you knit several pieces together in a patchwork fashion.
Are you also teaching me how to do patchwork?
Yes, it is included in the curriculum.
Yes, I see. I understand.
Yes, thank you #@Affiliation# Counselor #@Name#

Can I use thread used in French embroidery?
Yes, we also use French embroidery thread and embroidery wool in our #@product#
Then is it different from the regular #@product#?
Yes, you can think of it as a #@product# for small embroidery using embroidery thread, not the usual yarn #@product#.
When I was embroidering, it was hard to put the thread into the needle. Can #@Product# make it a little easier?
Yes, I think most people find the first hour the most difficult part of the day to be threading the needle.
You can easily thread the thread using a threading tool.
Yes, I understand. Thank you.

Can even a beginner do design well?
Yes, that's right. Crochet doesn't require any great design or sense of drawing skills.
What kind of picture do you need?
Anyone can easily complete a crochet hook if they know their favorite color combination or the shape of their favorite bag.
This is my first time using a crochet hook. Won't it be confusing?
The lectures are organized sequentially according to difficulty, starting with how to hold a needle, which many people find confusing at first.
If there are any parts you don't understand, you can quickly do it by watching the video over and over again and following along slowly.
Yes, I see. I understand.

#@Product# I want to know about the curriculum
Yes, is there a class you are looking at?
No, not really
For the flower design class, most of the items are bouquets, mini bouquets, flower boxes, etc.
In addition, there are vases, dry wreaths, etc.
Yes, I see. Then what does the bouquet contain?
There are four three-dimensional packaging methods, packaging paper characteristics, and cutting methods.
Are there different ways to pack your food?
Yes, I will tell you in three ways.
Yes, I see. I understand.
Yes, thank you #@Affiliation# Counselor #@Name#
Good morning #@Affiliation# Counselor #@Name#
I want to try #@product#
Is the class difficult since it's my first time knitting?
#@Product# is aimed at intermediate users, so it may be difficult for beginners to try it right away.
So what should a beginner do?
If you start with basic design socks from the curriculum of the class above, you can build a solid foundation.
So does that mean I can just listen?
Yes, it is difficult to try right away, but it is possible if you build a solid foundation.
Yes, so after taking the class, can I make a piece in a different size than the design?
At the beginning of the work, I recommend knitting a piece that fits your hand and foot to actually feel the size and fit of the piece.
Oh, I see. Okay, I understand.
Yes, thank you #@Affiliation# Counselor #@Name#
Hello, this is counselor #@name# from #@affiliation#
Yes, hello. I'm calling because I have a question.
The thing is, I would like to support #@product#
Which course has the best prospects?
Oh yes #@Product# Are you curious about the outlook for each process?
Yes, that's right. I'm not sure yet.
Yes, first of all, it is a part that differs depending on each individual's ability.
I don't think it's possible to give you a definitive answer.
But if there is a field that you are interested in and good at,
It would be best to prioritize that field.
Oh, then would it be better to categorize these by priority, etc.?
Yes, then plan on whether you would like to work in another company or organization.
Then, we collect recruitment information from the place of employment.
It is advisable to seek advice from professionals in the relevant field.
If you say you have made these plans
Lastly, you should decide on the #@affiliation# course and the time of taking the course.
Oh yes, thank you for the detailed explanation.
For additional detailed information, please refer to our #@affiliation# homepage.
I think you can proceed with that in mind. Do you have any additional questions?
No, there isn't any, thank you
Yes, thank you, this was counselor #@name#. Have a nice day.
Hello, this is counselor #@name# from #@affiliation#
Yes, hello, I was wondering when the recruitment period is.
Yes, currently #@affiliation# starts training in January, April, July, and October every year.
Oh, the training is conducted every three months.
Yes, that's right. The training period is three months.
Therefore, the recruitment period is in December, March, June, and September, one month before the start of the semester.
During that time, we are posting an announcement on the recruitment notice on this website.
Oh yes, thank you for the detailed explanation.
Yes, if you have any additional questions about the recruitment guidelines
You can ask questions to the media education department.
If you don't mind, can I give you my number?
Yes, yes, please let me know. Just a moment. I'll take note. Please call me.
Yes, it's #@phone number#

Yes, hello. I have a question about support.
Oh, yes, what are you curious about regarding support?
Yes, is it possible to apply for multiple positions?
Oh, are you talking about multiple support for regular classes?
Yes, I was wondering if it would be possible at the same time.
Please check the training schedule for your support group and make sure the schedules do not overlap.
Multiple applications are possible, but only if it is no longer a regular class.
Please consider whether to take the course or not by taking into account supplementary classes, special lectures, assignment practice hours, etc.
Oh, yes, I called because I was confused about whether it was okay or not, but thank you.
Yes, yes, I'm glad that your questions were answered.
Yes, that's right, I definitely got it, thank you
Do you have any further questions?
No, there is none
Yes, have a nice day. This was counselor #@name#. Thank you.
Hello, this is counselor #@name# from #@affiliation#
Yes, hello. I have a question about the interview process.
Oh, you mean the interview?
Yes, that is correct
What do they ask you during the interview process?
Oh, yes, first of all, it's not like it's set in stone or anything.
Because each individual has different support requirements and evaluation factors.
Please understand that it is difficult to say for sure that I am asking this question.
However, they usually ask questions about your interest in the support process and your ability to express yourself.
Applicants will often be asked what they expect from the course.
Oh, so I'm curious about how interested I am.
Or, there will be a lot of questions about future development potential.
Yes, that is correct. So, there are areas that I would like to improve through this class.
It might help if you sort that out in advance.
Yes, I'll try that. Thanks for the answer.
Okay, have a nice day. This was counselor #@name#
Hello, this is counselor #@name# from #@affiliation#
Yes, hello. I just wanted to know how the practical test is conducted.
Are you talking about the practical exam?
Yes, it's the academy's practical exam.
First of all, is there a course you are interested in?
Oh, I'm interested in the announcer course, but I'm not sure yet.
Then I will help you explain the whole process.
For the announcer course, there is a manuscript prepared by the academy.
Are you talking about manuscripts like announcing, narration, and reporting?
Yes, that's right. We conduct video and audio tests using job-related manuscripts.
Shopping Host Broadcast Reporter Also does video audio tests with related manuscripts
However, the voice acting process itself is a bit different from the original manuscript.
We are only conducting audio tests using movie documentary manuscripts, etc.
Oh, there are some differences. I understand. Thank you.
Yes, do you have any additional questions?
No, there is none
Yes, have a nice day. This was counselor #@name#. Thank you.
Hello, this is counselor #@name# from #@affiliation#
Yes, hello. I have a question about support.
Oh, yes, are you talking about applying to the Academy?
Yes, that's right. Are there people who fail if they apply?
First of all, please understand that it is difficult to give you an exact answer because each process is different.
Oh, then you don't know?
Well, it's hard to tell you the exact number of people who failed.
But in general, the competition rate is over 25 to 1 on average.
Therefore, it is impossible to predict the dropouts as they vary by course and by batch.
Oh, the competition rate is higher than I thought. So, of course, there is a chance of failing.
Yes, there are cases where you fail, but don't be afraid and prepare according to the recruitment guidelines.
It's also a good idea to try it out confidently.
Oh yes, thank you for your answer and words of encouragement.
Yes, yes, do you have any additional questions?
No, I don't have any questions because the part I was curious about has been resolved.
Oh, yes, have a nice day. This was counselor #@name#. Thank you.
Hello, this is counselor #@name# from #@affiliation#
Yes, hello. I have a question about support, so I'm contacting you.
Oh yes #@Affiliation# Are you talking about support?
Yes, yes, is there a set number of people to be selected?
Oh, you're right about the garden.
Yes, that's correct. How many people will be selected?
In the case of your academy, we select students through absolute evaluation, not relative evaluation.
So there is no separate garden or anything like that.
That's why the number of successful applicants is different for each semester.
Oh, everything is different, I thought it was fixed
Oh, I see. I told you that it varies depending on the evaluation method.
Do you have any further questions?
No, there is none
Yes, I understand. Please refer to the recruitment information carefully.
This was counselor #@name# Thank you and have a nice day.
Hello, this is counselor #@name# from #@affiliation#
Yes, hello. I have some questions about applying to the academy.
Oh yes, are you talking about applying for #@affiliation#?
Yes, yes, is it possible to fail and then pass again?
Oh, you mean whether or not you were accepted after the final application result was rejected?
Yes, that's right. I was wondering if there were any additional passing cases.
Oh, yes, unfortunately, it is difficult for those who fail to pass the exam to pass additionally or pass provisionally.
Oh, yes, that's how it is.
Yes, yes, do you have any further questions?
No, there is no separate one. I was wondering about the additional pass or preliminary pass section.
Okay, I hope that answers your questions and have a nice day.
Thank you, counselor #@name#
Hello, this is counselor #@Affiliation#, #@Name#. How may I help you?
Yes, hello. I have a question about the lecture.
Yes, sir, what part are you curious about?
Yes, these days, there are a lot of people staying at home because of the coronavirus.
Will the course be cancelled if there are few applicants or insufficient registrants due to COVID-19?
Yes, that's right. If the number of participants is not sufficient, the class will be cancelled.
Oh, so if the course is canceled after I pay the tuition, will I get a refund?
Yes, of course, in case of cancellation, we will process a refund along with refund instructions.
Oh, yes, thank goodness. I was a little surprised because I thought it wouldn't work.

Yes, hello. I have a question about the course.
I called because I was curious about the broadcast program production training that was included in the training course.
Oh, yes, I will check.
This course is a hands-on course where you can experience production using broadcast equipment.
We divide the trainees into teams according to each field, such as PDs, announcers, and writers.
You can think of it as a process of producing using professional broadcasting equipment.
Oh, yes, thank you for the explanation. I'm interested in music broadcasting.
Is it possible to configure a program that fits this?
Because the programs we produce are different depending on the composition and the field.
I think the field you mentioned could also be organized around music videos.
Oh yes, thank you so much for the detailed explanation. I understood it correctly.
Yes, thank you. Any further questions?
No, nothing in particular

Also, since it is different every year for each public offering, please check the broadcasting company's website.
Please refer to the latest recruitment notice
Ah, is there no way to summarize it all at once?
No, unfortunately not. Do you have any other questions?
No, there is none. Thank you.

This is a program for elementary school students to learn operations.
Can I still do this when I enter elementary school this time?
Yes, it is systematically organized by step, as needed per day.
How do I know my learning achievements?
Simultaneous measurement of accuracy and speed is possible with automatic scoring and error note functions.
Is it only possible to study on a PC?
#@Product# You can calculate on the tab without books and workbooks for exclusive use
It's not like there's a textbook, you just solve the problems on something like a Galaxy Tab.
#@Product# is automatically graded, so children can learn on their own.
Well then, I guess I'll have to talk to the kid about it.

I'm trying to solve non-literature past exam questions. Will it help if I prepare with that textbook?
How exactly is this textbook structured?

First of all, the all-in-one course is a course that completes the entire scope of the theory of civil servant Korean language.
Well, then this will be a basic lecture.
Yes, and the grammar rules are a course focused on the grammar rules section of the Korean grammar test book.
Yes, I would say it is a lecture that focuses more on grammar.
#@Name# If you go to the professor's page, the lectures are divided by curriculum.
Yes, I need to go to your professor's page and look at the details and make a choice.

This is an opportunity to objectively evaluate your child's abilities.

Unfortunately, we do not sell free pass products limited to individual professors.
Well, I asked because I didn't need to hear the entire free pass due to personal reasons, but I guess there's nothing I can do about it.

I'm contacting you because I have a question about college admission consulting.
Yes sir, how may I help you?
Why does it say that there is no such university in the recommended universities?
Excuse me, but we are providing guidance based on your current grades.
Please understand that there are no recommended universities based on your current grades.
This is so shocking. Does that mean I can't go to college?
The results shown in the recommended universities on the site are only approximate information.
Since this is not an absolute standard, you can manage your grades from now on.
Oh yes, I have to study hard.
Yes, sir, cheer up. Do you have any other questions?
No, there isn't, thank you
Yes, customer, keep up the good work today. This was consultant #@name#.

I'm contacting you because I have a question about college admission consulting.
Yes sir, how may I help you?
Is there no rural typical analysis service?
Unfortunately, the number of applicants is small and the admission results are not being made public.
We ask for your understanding as we are unable to provide service due to this.
It's so inconvenient. I needed it because there wasn't much information.
If not, how about receiving admission consulting directly this time?
Our representative is conducting it directly for the test takers.
Oh, okay, how do I apply?
Click on the Consulting Reservation banner on our main homepage
After clicking, you can proceed with making a consultation reservation.

Then, can you access My Page at the top of the homepage?
Yes, but I haven't solved all the problems yet. What should I do?
Ah, you can continue solving the problem later, so don't worry.
Yes, I understand. I have now accessed My Page.
Please access the personal information modification menu on My Page.

How do I fix it?

#@Other# I solved the previous exam questions and submitted them, but the analysis results are not coming out.
Are you sure that the grading has been completed?
It's not yet being graded. I guess it will only be confirmed once the grading is complete.
Yes, that's right, it's only available after the grading is complete.
Um, and I have another question.
Yes, please tell me.
In what cases is direct grading done?
Yes, direct grading is used when grading subjective answers.
After selecting Direct Grading, the customer will grade it themselves.
Oh, I see. Thank you for your kind advice.
Please take care of your health during Corona. This was counselor #@name#

I have some questions about the internship.
Yes, member. We will help you after a simple verification.
Excuse me, but could you tell me which department you were accepted to?
I was accepted to the child care department.
Since I started my studies while working, it was difficult for me to go on an internship.
Yes, first of all, congratulations again on passing.
For working people, internships are mainly held on weekends or at night.
Oh, I see. Then that's good.
For more detailed information, I think it would be best to consult directly with the professor in charge.
Oh, then please give me the professor's contact information.
Yes, can you take notes now?
Yes, you can. Please call me.
The professor in charge's contact information is #@phone number#
I will also give you the contact information of the teaching assistant in charge. Please request a consultation by calling #@phone number#.

I registered for a part-time job, but I would like to inquire about class times.

Yes, you can take classes whenever and wherever you want.
How do I purchase textbooks?
After entering your student number and password on the homepage and logging in, you will see the textbook purchase button.

I'll be happy to give you some helpful advice. #@Affiliation# #@Name#
I'm a third year junior at a vocational college and would like to get a four-year bachelor's degree. Is the course registration finished?
First of all, thank you for your interest in our university.
Unfortunately, the second semester transfer application for the 2004 school year has closed.
Could you please tell me what the conditions are for transfer?
Yes, if you are transferring to the third year, you must graduate from a junior college.
Oh, I'm currently enrolled in school, but I guess I have to graduate.
Yes, you must graduate first and earn at least 70 credits to transfer.
I guess I have to fill in the credits too
Yes, that's right. It's a prerequisite, so please be sure to pay attention.
Yes, I will try again after I graduate.
Have a nice day, this was counselor #@name#
I will do my best to advise you. #@Affiliation# #@Name#
Yes, I am thinking of giving up on enrolling in the Department of Childcare because I cannot do my internship.
Are there any courses that don't have practical training?
Hello, you can enroll in the Hotel Management Department without having to do the internship.
Oh, so there are no practical courses in hotel management?
There are practical courses, but you don't have to take them.
Oh, you're saying that there are practical subjects, but they are not required subjects.
Yes, that's right. It's not a required subject, so you don't have to worry too much about the practical training.
That's great. Thank you for your kind advice.
Do you have any further questions?
No, I was relieved that I didn't have to go to the internship.
Yes, have a nice day #@name#
Nice to meet you, I am #@Affiliation# #@Name#
Do I have to listen to the lecture and click the complete button to be considered for attendance?
Yes, attendance check is done after you log in and finish watching the lecture on the lecture screen.
You must click the Complete button to check attendance.
Oh, so just logging in doesn't check attendance?
Yes, it is the same concept as offline classes where attendance is recognized only when you go to school and attend all lectures.
Yes, I understand. I'm not familiar with taking classes online.
It is convenient to think of it as being the same as offline, except that it is non-face-to-face.
Yes, thank you for your kind reply.
Yes, do you have any other questions?
No, it's okay. Take care.
Thank you and have a nice afternoon #@Name#
Nice to meet you, I am #@Affiliation#, counselor #@Name#
I applied for a total of three subjects this semester.
I just found out that the Internet Chinese course has been discontinued. What is this?
First of all, I'm so sorry for the inconvenience.
Why didn't you inform the applicants that the course was closed?
We announced through a notice that we would be closing classes starting August 25th.
Please understand that I will not contact you individually.
So do I have to check all the notices every time?
Yes, please make sure to read the notices related to each class and the overall notice.
No, I might miss the notice, but it's really inconvenient.
Please understand that it may be difficult to contact each student individually due to the large number of students.
There is too little consideration for the students. Okay, I'll hang up.
I apologize again for the inconvenience. I'm sorry, this was counselor #@name#.
Good morning #@Affiliation# Counselor #@Name#
I'm in my 40s and I'm interested in social welfare.
Are there any older people in the Department of Social Welfare?
Hello, first of all, thank you for your interest in our university.
Yes, in the case of our university's Department of Social Welfare, there are many people in their 40s and 50s.
Oh really, I was really worried that I wouldn't have any friends my age.
Housewives also have goals and study hard.
Then I guess I should stop worrying and just take on the challenge.
Yes, those who were awkward at first are all doing well now.
Hearing those words gives me strength
Yes, once you enroll, you will be able to help each other study.
I see, that helped me a lot in deciding, thank you
Have a nice day #@Name#
This is #@Affiliation# counselor #@Name# who brings you happiness.
I want to graduate early, but do I have to do an internship in the second semester of my third year?
You only need to do the internship before you graduate.
If you wish to graduate early, you only need to complete the prerequisite courses.
If you complete the prerequisite subjects first, you can apply for the practical subjects.
Oh, I see. If I transfer to another university, when will I do my internship?
If you wish to transfer to another university, our university does not recognize dual enrollment.
Please contact the university you wish to transfer to to see if dual enrollment is possible.
Oh, yes, I understand. Thank you.
Yes, sir, do you have any other questions?
No, there is nothing else
Yes, customer, please take care of your health during Corona. This was the counselor #@name#
This is #@Affiliation# counselor #@Name# who brings you joy.
Hello, I am a third-year high school student who applied for admission this time.
I got a job right after I graduated from high school.
I would like to ask if it would be difficult to live a college life while working.
Oh, I think you don't have to worry too much.
Our school offers 100% online classes, so you can take them freely within the designated dates.
Oh, is that so? Then what happens in cases like exams?
You can also submit all exams and reports online.
Oh yes, that's so lucky
Yes, and there are many people like you who study while working.
Customers, please don't worry too much and just follow the course diligently.
Oh, yes, thank you for your advice, counselor.
Yes, I hope you have a happy day today. This was counselor #@name#
This is #@Affiliation# counselor #@Name# who brings you joy.
Hello, I am applying to the Department of Social Welfare as a freshman this time.
I am a working person and I cannot do my internship during the day, so I was wondering if I could do it on weekday evenings or weekends.
Yes, first of all, thank you for applying to our university.
If you contact the training institution, you can adjust the time to your preference.
Oh, that's possible, thank goodness.
Also, the internship is conducted in the fourth year, so you can focus only on online classes for now.
Oh, I see. Thank you for your explanation.
Yes, sir, do you have any other questions?
No, thank you for your detailed advice.
Yes, thank you. Have a good night. This was your counselor, #@name#
I'll help you with anything #@Affiliation# Counselor #@Name#
Hello, I would like to get some lecture recommendations.
Yes, which lecture are you talking about?
I want to become a real estate agent, but I'm an office worker.
So, I want to get it in a short period of time because I have to study while working at the company.
Oh, I see. It must be hard to balance work and study.
Is there any kind of lecture that is short and concise, even if it is Spartan?
Well, if that's the case, customer, how about preparing something like #@product# in the short term?
Is that the shortest lecture?
Yes, dear customer, although it is a short period of time, we have prepared from #@Product# to #@Product# to #@Product#.
Thanks for the recommendation. I'll have to try it. Thanks for your hard work.
Hello, this is counselor #@name#
Yes, hello, this is the counseling center.
Yes, sir, please speak.
I'm wondering whether I should sign up for the course or just go to the academy.
I see. Of course, academy lectures are good, but online lectures have their own convenience and advantages.
For example, what are the advantages?
First of all, online lectures are cheaper than private academies.
And you can study the parts you don't understand by repeating them.
Oh, I see. I think online classes are better because they can give me customized lessons.
Yes, customer, and there is no time or place restriction, so if you want to study, you can start right away.
I guess I should try signing up for a class rather than going to an academy.
I'll have to take a look to see which lectures to take. Thank you.
This is #@name#, a counselor who does his best.
#@Affiliation# #@Product# I would like to ask about the final conclusion date of the last regular curriculum.
Is there a specific subject you would like to ask about?
Please give me the schedule for civil law lectures
The final summary of lectures 7 to 10 will be uploaded on October 5th.
What about tax laws then?
Uploading will start on October 5th and will end on the 14th.
It's uploading a little faster than I thought.
Please note that the lecture upload schedule may change depending on the professor's schedule.
Yes, I understand. Thank you for your answer.
Please refer to the website announcement for detailed schedule.
Yes, good work today too
Today is also a great day #@Affiliation# Certification Counselor #@Name#
Hello, I'm trying to get some computer certification.
What kind of certification do you want to get, sir?
They say that the easy qualification is ITQ.
It is a basic qualification, so many people look for it.
Is this a very helpful certification?
It is a qualification that will help you improve your computer expertise and skills in this information age, so it is a qualification that will help you improve your skills.
I guess I should study it sometime. I'll be able to get it soon.
Since many people usually pass, you will definitely pass too.
Okay, I understand. I'll sign up for the lecture and take a look.
I am #@Affiliation# counselor #@Name#, full of joy
Hello, I am looking for a job in an office environment and would like to obtain basic qualifications.
Yes, you are preparing for employment.
I don't know what to get since I've never studied for a certificate.
Could you give me a brief explanation and recommendation?
If you are going to an office job, I recommend ITQ, which includes Excel, PowerPoint, Word, and Hangul.
Is it a difficult difficulty?
The difficulty level is not that hard, so it won't be burdensome for beginners.
How long is the course period?
90 days from the date of purchase of the course
I really want to get a certificate. Okay.
This was the best #@affiliation# counselor #@name#
Nice to meet you, I am #@Affiliation#, counselor #@Name#
Hello, I want to prepare for the IT tax certification.
Yes, sir, you mean computerized accounting and taxation.
I would like to receive lecture recommendations from #@affiliation#
In that case, how about #@product#?
We analyze the passing patterns of numerous successful applicants to create a high-scoring curriculum that is more reliable.
Then I believe it more
Yes, our professional faculty member, Professor #@Name#, will be teaching the lecture.
I guess he's a very famous person. I'll have to look him up and try it out.
Thank you for your interest in our #@affiliation# course.
Yes, thank you. Thank you for your hard work.
Start your day with a good feeling #@Affiliation# Counselor #@Name#
Yes, hello. This is customer service. I would like to contact you.
Yes, sir, what questions do you have?
I'm looking into #@affiliation# while looking around here and there to try firefighting for the first time.
It seems like you are selling other academy courses, but is it possible to check out sample courses?
First of all, we apologize for any inconvenience caused to you.
We do not provide sample lectures, so you must visit another site.
I see. If that's the case, I don't think #@affiliation# will make the payment directly.
As you said, I think providing a trial course is necessary from the consumer's perspective.
In this case, we will consult with the company and proceed with sufficient consultation with the company.
Yes, I hope it gets reflected soon.
It's a sunny morning. This is #@Affiliation# Counselor #@Name#
Yes, I am currently taking all #@product# classes.
Yes sir, please speak
I'm trying to prepare for the civil service exam, but there aren't any separate classes for Korean.
I think it's because Korean has been excluded from 2022. Can I register for a separate course?
Yes, sir, that's right.
In the case of firefighting, we are currently providing services by receiving content from outside sources.
Please note that we can only provide services that receive content from external sources.
Oh, then it would be difficult to only listen to Korean.
I'm so sorry I couldn't help you.
No, I can't help it. It's okay.
Have a nice day today #@Name#
I'll help you with anything #@Affiliation# Counselor #@Name#
Hello, I recently stopped taking the #@product# lecture.
Yes, customer, you purchased #@product#
The thing is, I'm studying using my iPad.
BI wonder if I can get or purchase the PDF file of the existing textbook.
#@Affiliation# Due to internal policy, it is difficult to provide PDF files for the entire course for civil servant lectures.
Oh, is that so? I understand that in the case of #@product#, you provide a file.
Yes, we do provide it for #@product#
I received the textbook, but it was inconvenient to scan them one by one, so I asked. Okay.
Yes, thank you for using our #@affiliation#. This is counselor #@name#.
I will do my best #@Affiliation# #@Name#
Hello, this is #@affiliation# customer center.
Yes, customer service is correct, customer.

I'll have to go to the website and check.

I am #@Affiliation# counselor #@Name#, full of joy

Yes, of course #@Product# is a service provided to help you achieve your target TOEIC score.
#@Product# is a premium refund course that helps you achieve your TOEIC goals.
I guess they also give refunds if you reach your goal.
Refunds will be made when the goal is achieved.
It consists of real first-class instructors who dominate the three major academies of Gangnam, Jongno, and Sinchon.
If it consists of famous people, it's trustworthy.
I think it's worth taking the class. I'll think about it and apply.
I hope today is filled with only happy things #@Name#
We will take good care of you. #@Product# #@Name# This is a counselor.

Yes sir, how may I help you?
Is it not possible to purchase #@product# right now?
Currently, #@Product# is being renewed and cannot be purchased.
Is it only available to people who have previously purchased it?
Yes, customers, only those who have already completed a purchase can use it until the end of the period of use.
Um, when will it be available for purchase?
It's difficult to give you an exact answer, but we will be back soon with a new #@product#
I hope it comes out soon. Okay.
Thank you, it was #@affiliation# that did its best
Thank you for your inquiry. This is counselor #@Affiliation# #@Name#
Yes I am using #@product#
Yes, you are using our product.
I see that you can use MP3 files as well. Where can I download these files?
For the #@product# of the lecture materials, please go to the lecture room page of the relevant lecture.
Wait a minute, I'm a bit older
Yes, sir. Can you see the learning materials room next to the learning class?
Ah, I found it. Yes, I pressed it.
Yes, you can download it here and use it.
Thank you so much, I found it easily thanks to you
Take care of your health in this hot weather. #@Name# is a counselor.
Sorry for the late response #@Affiliation# #@Name#
Hello, this is customer service. I have an urgent question.
Yes, sir, what is your inquiry?
You went into the study materials room to download an MP3 file, but you can't see the file.
I tried to download an MP3 file, but I can't see the file to download.
Are you using #@Product# instead of #@Product#?
Yes, that's right. I bought the textbook and am using it.
I see. In that case, you should search for it on the textbook page, not the learning materials room.
Oh, I guess I found the wrong one
Search for a textbook on the textbook page and click Use Learning Service below.
Ah, the file appears below.
Yes, you can learn using that file.
Thank you so much, I was struggling in vain
No, I'm glad it helped. This was counselor #@name#
Hello, this is counselor #@name#
Yes I am listening to #@product#
You are using #@Product#
I would like to apply for an extension of my study period.
Let's first check the product you purchased.
Could you please tell me your ID?
My ID is #@account#
I checked and you can apply for a refund or re-enrollment until October 5th.
Oh, that's possible. I'm really glad.

Hello, I'm contacting you to inquire about the lecture.
Yes, you contacted me about an inquiry regarding my lecture.
I want to repeat #@product# 3 times and then move on to the next lesson.
I'm curious about the difference between #@Product# and #@Product#
If you move on to the next lesson, does that mean you're moving on to #@Product#?
Yes, that's right. Is it okay to take the class with #@product#?
If you repeated #@Product# 3 times, I don't think you'll have much trouble.
However, it is difficult to judge the learner's ability.
How about getting a course recommendation after solving the problem through #@Product#?
There is a way like that, so I think it would be good to be able to clearly see my skills.
Please use #@Product# as there is #@Product# in #@Product#
Have a nice day today #@Name#
Thank you for calling. This is counselor #@Affiliation# #@Name#
Hello, I would like to ask about the order of listening to #@Product#.
Hello, member #@Product#, what is the order of listening?
Yes, can I listen to the main lecture in the order of #@Product# #@Product#?
#@Product# is a summary of the key contents of this lecture.
I recommend this for review after taking this course.
Then it would be better to listen to #@product# and then listen to #@product#
You can take the classes according to your needs, and there is no set order.
Depending on the time, you can take only #@Product#, or you can take it freely.
Thank you, I was listening to it in order.
Thank you, counselor #@name#
This is #@Affiliation# counselor #@Name#
Yes, I would like to inquire about your study hours.
Is this your first time learning, sir?

Oh, it's not like I listen to it at a set time.
Yes, you can listen at any time of the day you want.
Oh, that's good. I don't have time during the day.
I think you can take the class at a time that is convenient for you.
Yes, I will take the class at a time that is convenient for you. Thank you.
Do you have any other questions, sir?
No, I don't think there's anything special
Have a great day today, counselor #@name#

Also, please note that since the academy opened on May 11, it may take up to 7 days for the online classes to start.
Oh, then #@Product# will first open as an online class in May.
Yes, that's right, customer. #@Product# will be opened in June.
Yes, I understand. Now that I know the start date of the lecture, it will be easier to plan my studies.
Do you have any other questions, sir?
No, I asked everything. Thank you for your advice.
Please contact me anytime #@Affiliation# Thank you
Hello, I am a transfer specialist, counselor #@affiliation# #@name#. How may I help you?

Yes, customer, the #@product# you inquired about is confirmed to be a course that is only offered at the academy.
Therefore, please understand that you cannot register for classes with the pass you have.
Oh, so if I want to take the class, I have to take it at an academy?
Yes, that's right, sir. The course start date is confirmed to be May 12th.
Okay, I understand. I guess I'll have to ask the academy again.
Do you have any further questions?

What classes should I take for general transfer biology classes in the Department of Oriental Medicine?

Hello, this is #@affiliation#, the absolute best in transfer. How can I help you?
Hello, I'm trying to buy #@product#
Does this product not include lectures at Yonsei University?
Yes, customer, what is the #@product# you inquired about?
This product includes regular courses in English and mathematics for transfer students and special lectures on past exam questions.
However, this product does not include major courses at Yonsei University, so please take note of this when organizing your curriculum.
Oh, so the curry is organized separately for Yonsei University, so do I need to purchase it separately to prepare for it?
Yes, that's right. You can check the Yonsei University preparatory curriculum in the upper right corner.
Ah, I'm trying to apply to only one of the two, but it's quite ambiguous.
Do you have any further questions, sir?
Yes, it's okay for now
Yes, I'm sorry I couldn't give you a satisfactory answer. Please contact me anytime.
I was a counselor #@name# Thank you

Shortcut to passing the transfer #@Affiliation# Hello
Yes, hello. I'm contacting you to inquire about the opening of that course.
If you tell us the name of the course or the name of the professor, we can respond more quickly.
#@Name# Professor, can you tell me when lecture 220 will start?
In the case of Professor #@Name#'s #@Product#, it has been confirmed that the academy opened on May 1st.
Therefore, please note that it may take up to 7 days for the lecture to start.
Well, I don't know the exact date, but it will take about 7 days.
Yes, that's right. We ask for your understanding as we cannot give you the exact date of the class opening.
Time is important for test takers, and if it goes on like this, it becomes too unpredictable.
I think there may be a hitch in the plan.
Yes, I'm sorry, sir. If you want to know the detailed schedule, please ask the professor again through the learning Q&amp;A.
Yes, I understand. I think it would be better if this part was improved.
We will forward your advice to the relevant department and work to improve it.

Hello, this is transfer mate #@affiliation# counselor #@name#. How may I help you?
Yes, hello. I'm calling to inquire about something.
Yes, sir. What part is inconvenient? I will help you with a quick consultation.
I don't know the difference between #@Product# and #@Product#, so I'd like to ask for advice.
Customer #@Product# is a product that allows you to take regular courses and special lectures on past exam questions in English and mathematics.
#@Product# is a product that allows you to take courses at Yonsei University, excluding medical courses.
Oh, so it's divided into basic and major.
Yes, sir, I think you can see it that way. The big difference is the scope of the classes you can take.
Good thing you asked. Then I guess I'll have to follow the #@Product# curriculum.
Do you have any further questions?
Yes, all my questions have been answered. Thank you for your advice.
Yes, please feel free to contact us at any time. We will be happy to help you. Thank you.

Yes, sir. How can I help you?
#@Product# When will the Sunday lecture be uploaded?
Is this the course you inquired about #@product#?

Oh, then how can I listen to the #@name# lecture from the basics to the advanced level?

I'm contacting you to inquire about the course.
Yes, please tell me what you need help with.
The thing is, I am currently using the 3-month online comprehensive course that I purchased.
For transfer math, you can only take two classes per month.
Yes, dear customer, unfortunately, in the case of the online comprehensive course, the number of math courses that can be applied for per month is limited to 2.
I only want to take math, but could you let me take 3 classes, even if it's just for the first month?
This applies equally to all other members and is also stated in the sales page usage instructions.
We apologize for not being able to help you with adding math classes.
Yes, I asked in case you could be considerate, but it seems like it won't work out.
I apologize for not being able to give you a satisfactory answer.
Do you have any additional questions?
No, no more. Thank you for your consultation today.
Please feel free to ask questions about your exam life at any time. Have a nice day. Thank you.
Thank you, my transfer companion #@affiliation#
Yes, hello. I am using that pass and would like to inquire about the course.
Yes, what part are you curious about?
I purchased #@product# and applied for the course.
The lecture period is limited, so I can't listen to it after that?
Yes, dear customer, each course is sold as a single course product, so each course has its own unique course period.
If you want to take the same course again after the course ends, you can apply for the course again after the end date.
Oh, so the course I'm taking now ends at the end of this month, and if I want to take it again, I can reapply after the end of the month.
Yes, that's right, customer. However, if the course you applied for with #@Product# has a course period that has passed January 31st,
Please note that even if you have a unique course period remaining, you will no longer be able to take the course once the pass expires.
Oh, of course I thought that would be the case since I was using a pass.
You may ask me any additional questions.
No, there isn't. Thank you for your consultation today.
Yes, I will be with you until the day you pass.
I am #@affiliation# counselor #@name# Thank you
Your companion for passing is #@affiliation#
Yes, hello. I'm calling to ask you something about my class.
Yes, customer. Please tell me the name of the course or the details so I can help you.
I'm asking because I want to know if the course period can be extended.
I'm planning to take #@name# basic math. Is it possible to extend the period after the period ends?
Yes, the extension feature for your course period is only available when purchasing a single course or package course.
In addition, you can apply for extension of course registration up to 2 times per course, and you can extend it up to 5 days at a time, and an extension fee will be charged.
To calculate the extension fee, multiply the number of extension days by the daily tuition fee.
Oh, then can you tell me how the tuition fee is calculated?
The tuition fee for work is the total tuition fee divided by the duration of the course.
Yes, I understand. I will take note and apply for an extension.
Do you have any other questions?
I think I asked everything today. Thank you.
Yes sir, I am #@name# consultant. Have a nice day.

I would like to inquire about the refund mock exam.
Yes, customer, what part are you curious about?
It says that I have to take a total of 5 mock exams to get a refund.
Of course, this assumes you've passed the school.
So far, I have taken the nationwide mock exam once in June.
If I take the mock exam in August, September, October, and the final placement exam a total of 4 times, is it correct to count it as 5 times?
Yes, that's right, customer. Because you have already taken the national mock exam in June.
If you take all the remaining August and September monthly transfer mock exams, October national mock exams, and November placement exams,
It is expected that you will meet the mock exam refund conditions 5 times.
I asked just in case, and it turned out to be true.
Yes, I hope you prepare well for the exam and receive the refund scholarship.
Thank you. I will prepare hard and take the exam.
Do you have any further questions?
No, there isn't, everything is resolved.

Yes, hello. I would like to inquire whether I can take biology and chemistry classes with #@product#.
Yes, customer #@Product# is confirmed to be a pass that can be used for transfer English and transfer math preparation.
Therefore, please understand that it may be difficult to take major courses such as biology and chemistry.
Oh, then should I take biology or chemistry classes separately through #@Product# or #@Product#?
Yes, customer, the #@product# you mentioned is no longer available for purchase as sales have ended this year.
Currently, the pass product that allows you to take major courses at Yonsei University is #@Product#

Yes, customer, for this pass, you can take the basic course until December 31st.

Which schools would be acceptable if I have a mock exam score of 30% for transfer to a liberal arts college?

So you're saying that roughly the middle tier of Seoul is going to be there?

Hello, I was wondering if there are any nursing colleges that I can transfer to with TOEIC.
Yes, sir, are you talking about a university where you can enter the nursing department with an official English proficiency?
There are Samyuk University, Sungshin Women's University, Eulji University, Wonkwang University, and local national universities.
My final GPA is 3.69 and my TOEIC score is 800. Is it possible to raise it to the upper 900s?
Yes, dear customer, in the case of universities in the metropolitan area, the official English score is formed high.
So I think you need to get a score close to perfect to be able to do it.
Oh, I see. So you're saying it has to be almost perfect.
However, these universities also include official English test scores, GPA, and interviews.
Yes, that's right. I'll check the recruitment guidelines again and first raise my grades.
Yes, sir. If you would like more detailed consultation, please visit a nearby academy.
Yes, I understand. Thank you for your advice. It helped me plan my transfer preparations.

I am currently a first-year chemistry student.
As I studied, I found physics to be more interesting than chemistry.
I am planning to transfer to the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering while I am in my second year.
My GPA is around 4.4 and I get an A+ in physics and math.
I'm thinking about transfer preparation. What kind of studies would be good to do in the first year?
Yes, for general transfer, you must be expected to complete 4 semesters at a 4-year university.
In the case of transfer, you must be a graduate or expected graduate of a 4-year university.
You must meet the above conditions and the minimum credit requirement of the university you wish to transfer to in order to transfer.
Please check the credits required and official English qualifications for the department you are applying to.
It seems like a good idea to get certified English in advance during your first year.
In your second year, it would be a good idea to focus on the subjects you are applying to in the department.
You have the basic qualifications. It's a good idea to ask.
Yes, customer, please check the recruitment guidelines for the university you wish to apply to.
I will look for it right after the consultation. Thank you.
Are there any other questions?
Yes, that's enough. Thank you for your kind advice.
Please contact me anytime I am a counselor #@name# Thank you
Hello, this is transfer number one #@affiliation#
Yes, hello. I was wondering if I could get some advice on transferring.
Yes, sir. What part are you curious about?
I am currently in my second semester of my third year and have one year left until graduation.
Can I apply for general transfer even after graduating and receiving a bachelor's degree?
Yes, for general transfer, you must be a graduate or expected to graduate from a 2-3 year university.
Must be a student who is expected to complete or has completed 4 semesters of a 4-year university
In the case of transfer, you must be a graduate or expected to graduate from a 4-year university.
Considering the above conditions, if transfer is possible, you must also meet the general transfer qualifications.
Even after graduating from a 4-year university, you can still apply for general transfer.
Then, is it common for people to advance to nursing school like that?
Yes, customer, in the case of general transfer to the nursing department, there are universities that only nursing graduates can apply to.
Oh, then where should I check that?
For more detailed information, such as detailed application qualifications, please refer to the recruitment guidelines of the university you wish to apply to.
Oh, I see. Okay, I understand. I'll check it out now.
Yes, please contact me anytime. I will be happy to help you with your consultation. This was counselor #@Name#
Hello, this is transfer number one #@affiliation#
Yes, hello. I'm calling to ask for your advice.
Yes, sir, what part do you need advice on?
I'm studying pharmacy, and next year is my last chance.
I'm wondering if I should try again or prepare something else in advance.
Is there anything I can do to prepare for transfer based on what I studied in pharmacy school?
I think I saw it last time that you could prepare for medical school or dental school.
Yes, sir, studying chemistry and biology is essential for transferring to pharmacy school.
Students who were preparing to transfer to a pharmacy school also advance to the life science departments of Yonsei University, Chung-Ang University, and Ewha Womans University.
Or I'm trying to transfer to a medical school
Are there any other preparations required for transferring to the medical field?
Except for Kangwon National University, MDEET test scores are not required.
Most universities select students through biology and chemistry tests.
Oh, okay, then I think there's a slight possibility.
I think it would be a good idea for you to refer to the recruitment guidelines of the university you are interested in.
Yes, I understand. Thank you for your kind advice.
Please feel free to contact me anytime regarding your exam preparation. I will be happy to help you. #@Name# I was your counselor. Thank you.
Hello, this is #@affiliation# chosen by 200,000 successful applicants.
Hello, I have recently become interested in transferring, so I am looking into it.
I don't know much about transfer math, so I'd like to ask a question.
Is it possible that I'm preparing for transfer math from scratch now, and is it too late?
I'm also curious if there's anything else I need to prepare for besides transfer math.
Yes, customer, the transfer process is largely divided into the official English process and the transfer English process.
Most students are preparing for the transfer admission process, which offers many support opportunities.
There are some universities that you can apply to with only a transfer degree, so you should refer to the recruitment guidelines.
The trend is to prepare for about 9 months to 1 year before passing the exam.
Oh, right. I guess the longer the period, the more likely it is that you will pass.
Yes, customer, what determines whether you pass or fail is your will and effort rather than the preparation period.
Yes, I guess I should start studying by watching the transfer math lectures first.
I have a chance too, 9 months from now. There's plenty of time.
Yes, please take advantage of our trial course and prepare with an instructor who fits your style.
Yes, I will do that. Thank you for your kind advice.
Do you have any other questions, sir?
No, thank you for your consultation today.
I will be with you until you pass. I was a counselor #@name#.
Hello, this is transfer number one #@affiliation# counselor #@name#
Hello, I'm thinking about starting to transfer now.
Yes, sir. How can I help you?
I got a 3rd grade in English on the CSAT, but I went back and forth between a 1st and 2nd grade on the mock exam.
I don't think there will be much difficulty in entering the English language.
I want to go to a university a little higher than where I am now.
If possible, I would like to apply to a place that has ROTC. Is this possible?
Yes, customer, the transfer process is largely divided into the official English process and the transfer English process.
Most students are preparing for the English transfer admission process, which offers many opportunities for support.
If you have decided to transfer, check the admission guidelines of the university you wish to transfer to.
It seems like it would be a priority to check the eligibility requirements and selection method and then decide on a direction for study.
Yes, that's right. As you said, I think it would be right to start by deciding on a school.
Yes, please call us again after selecting your desired university.
Okay, I understand. I'll think about it and get back to you.
I will be with you until you pass. Thank you. #@Affiliation#
Hello, this is transfer expert #@affiliation#. How may I help you?
Yes, hello. I'm preparing to transfer to Korea University and I have a question.
Yes, sir. What part are you curious about? I will help you.
I understand that Korea University's recruitment guidelines come out in November. Is that correct?
Yes, our customer recruitment guidelines are usually released in late November to December.
The time of announcement of recruitment guidelines varies by university, but you can usually expect it to be around that time.
Then, I understand that Korea University did not require an official English score last year.
What will happen this year? I was thinking of preparing for the TEPS after the recruitment guidelines came out.
If it comes out in November, I think it will be too late.
Yes, dear customer, as of the 2021 academic year, Korea University has abolished the official English language application qualification.
You can submit official English test scores with other documents.
Oh, so you're saying that it's just an addition and not required?
Yes, that's right. Did you receive sufficient consultation?
Yes, I was able to clearly understand the part I was curious about. Thank you.
I will be with you until you pass. #@Affiliation# Counselor #@Name# Thank you.
This is #@Affiliation# #@Name# with our customers.
#@Name# Are you the customer?
Yes #@name# is correct
I would like to provide guidance on the registration of the student you inquired about.
Sorry, did you run the synchronization process once?
#@Other# Are you talking about that?
Yes, that's right #@Other#
Should I do that now?
Could you please give it a try?
Please proceed a bit, I will wait.
Should we do this to us now?
I don't have time to do this because I'm in class, can't I do it now?
There is no part that I can synchronize for you.
You can do it quickly on that #@guitar# site, but it's a little difficult
Wait a minute #@Other# site
You can do it right away if you go to our site.
Okay, then I'll go to the site and check.
A Yes, it was #@name# so far. Thank you.
Hello, I got a call.
Yes, hello. This is #@Affiliation# Customer Center #@Name#
Excuse me, but are you a customer of #@Name# #@Name#?
Yes, that's right #@Affiliation#
Yes, nice to meet you, customer.
We have made several phone calls to those who signed up for our English learning program.
I'm contacting you to give you some information and to thank you. Can I talk to you for a moment?
Yes, please tell me.
Yes, thank you #@Affiliation# Thank you so much for choosing to learn English.
Excuse me, but did you receive an explanation about learning from the teacher before signing up?
Yes, I got the explanation.
Thank you. Please confirm the information for smooth customer service in the future.
Your home address is #@address#
Yes, #@address# is correct
Yes, the number I contacted you is your mobile phone number.
Yes, your number is correct.
Would you like me to register your email address?
I really have to do this
No, you don't have to do it if you don't want to.
Okay, then I won't do it.
Yes, I understand. If you have any questions while studying,
Please contact our customer service center at #@phone number#
Yes, I understand. Thank you.
This is #@Affiliation# #@Name# with our customers.
You said you wanted to apply for learning right away before signing up for membership.
Yes, that's right. Please apply right away.
I made a phone call once and was about to apply right away.
Then, you want to call and talk to that teacher.
There was a set teacher
No, that's not it. I live in Bundang now.
I got a call from the Bundang branch once.
I applied for a consultation
#@Other# It's not related to that
No, it's not #@guitar#
So #@Other# is actually all about phone management.
There is not a #@Other# center in each region.
Yeah, it's not like it's in every region.
Yes, it is operated nationwide.
Actually, it's in Seoul, but you can also receive calls from teachers in the Gyeonggi-do area.
That's probably why there isn't a #@guitar# center nearby in Bundang.
So, please apply through the website and just click on the consultation request button.
Okay, yes, I understand.
Yes, do you have any other questions?
No, thank you
Yes thank you have a nice day #@name#
This is #@Affiliation# #@Name# with our customers.
You said you wanted to apply for learning right away before signing up for membership.
Yes, that's right. Please apply right away.
Yes, but please tell us where you live.
If you give me your child's information, I will forward it to a center that can provide basic care.
But there are advantages to the #@Other# homepage.
Please watch the exposed teacher introduction video and choose the teacher you would like to manage.
The advantage is that you can apply for consultation.
That has its advantages
So now, customers can look at the teacher's profile and other things.
If you apply by selecting the teacher you want, that teacher will contact you.
If we can pass it on, we'll pass it on to the basic management center.
I don't know which teacher will contact you.
If that's okay with you, we can deliver it for you.
So, you have to apply for a consultation first anyway.
Yes, that's right. You have to do it first.
I am #@Affiliation# #@Name# working with customers. How can I help you?
I tried to sign up for membership online
Teacher, now it's time to choose and move on.
Are you currently registering as a member on the Basic homepage?
Yes, I am doing it now.
But you have to choose a teacher and click on the free diagnostic evaluation.
Yes, what is your problem?
When I click on it, nothing happens and it doesn't go through.
If you want to skip the membership registration process before signing up,
You can apply for consultation first.
You are currently logged in and proceeding.
No, that means you can't even register as a member.
Yes, please contact us later to discuss membership.
When you start studying, your teacher will send you the URL.
Then, you can proceed with membership registration while making payment there.
Just select the teacher and apply for the product.
But do I really have to apply for this consultation? I can't apply right here.
Are you talking on the phone?
No, not on your phone.
It is possible by phone.

Hello, is the course registration first-come, first-served?
Oh, it's different for each class. In the case of classes with a limited number of students,
You need to hurry up and apply on the specified date.
Oh, so if you look here, out of the three, the one with 88 people written on it is first-come, first-served.
Yes, that's right. The class is limited to 88 people, so you have to proceed more quickly.
Oh, yes, I understand. Thanks for letting me know.
Yes, do you have any further questions?
No, nothing in particular
Yes, then please be careful of Corona. This was the counselor #@name#
Yes, thank you. Have a nice day.

What address should I enter in the address field to apply for Busan recruitment?
The address is entered to facilitate the execution of the test.
Then can I register my Busan address?

Yes, you can use anything.
Yes, regional recruitment, that is, the 9th grade civil service examination applicants' application requirements are assessed.

I would like to inquire about transfer admission.
Yes, what are you curious about?
I am currently enrolled in a PhD program at graduate school, but I would like to enroll for a bachelor's degree.
Is it possible to enroll even if I currently have academic records?
Since the doctoral and bachelor's degrees are different, they can be pursued concurrently.
So can the class be conducted online?
Yes, most of my classes are online.
Yes, I understand. Thank you.

Start your day with a good feeling #@Affiliation# Counselor #@Name#
I have a question about the graduate credit bank system.
Yes, please tell me anything you are curious about.
I am a graduate of a 4-year university and I am planning to transfer to the 3rd year Health Administration Department.
I understand that transferring to the third year requires earning 70 credits.
I have a subject that I took through the Credit Bank System. Can I bring it in as credit?
As you know, third-year transfer students must complete 70 credits to graduate.
Even if you have completed a course through the Credit Bank System, the 70 credits will not change.
So do I have to retake it?
Yes, I have to do it again
Then, how many major credits and how many liberal arts credits should I fill out of the 70 credits?
Please contact us by phone at #@affiliation# for more detailed information.
Okay, I understand. I'll have to call.
Yes, thank you #@Affiliation# Counselor #@Name#

Yes, what are you curious about?

When the childcare practice course starts, I need to attend the lecture. Where and how should I take it?

Also, please note that login is only possible after the first day of class, the 10th.

I would like to inquire about transfer admission.
Yes, what is your inquiry?
I graduated from a two-year college a long time ago and earned over 70 credits.
I'm looking into the credit bank system because I'm interested in learning.
In my case, can I apply for the Department of Health Administration through transfer?
Our university is a 4-year university, not a credit bank system.
If you graduated from a junior college, you can transfer to the third year.
Applicants can apply as a third-year student in the Department of Health Administration, and recruitment for the first semester of 2020 will begin on December 1.
If I start recruiting on the 1st, how long will it last?
We are recruiting until February, before the start of the semester in March.
Yes, I understand. Thank you.

I have a question about part-time registration.
Yes, what are you curious about?
I graduated from a university in Busan and am planning to transfer to another department.
It is said that you must complete 4 credits of prerequisite courses related to chemistry or biology.
In my case, I only need 4 credits. Can I complete them here?
Yes, first of all, through our university's part-time admission, you can take only the courses you want.
However, part-time admission for the second semester of 2019 has now closed.
So when is the next recruitment?
Only the first semester of 2020 is scheduled for recruitment.
Do you only recruit twice a year?
Yes, you can check the schedule on our school website.
Yes, I understand. Thank you.

Yes, hello. I have a question.
What are you curious about?
I want to become a radio PD. What should I do?
Radio PDs are selected through 100% open recruitment.
Will I be picked if I go to #@Affiliation#?
The Academy's practical training is very helpful in interviews and practical assessments.
However, you must also prepare for the civil service exam separately.
I thought I just had to go to #@affiliation#, but I guess I have to take a test
Yes, that's right. Do you have any other questions?
No, there is none
Yes, I understand. This was counselor #@name#. Thank you.

I'm looking into it because I want to get a job as a PD.
Oh, yes, how can I help you?
If you want to get a job as a PD, are there any disadvantages for women in getting a job?
The number of women applying for PD positions has been increasing in the past two to three years.
There is no place that restricts women's employment.
There is no limit, I understand.
Do you have any further questions?
No, there is none
Yes, I understand. This was counselor #@name#
Thank you and have a nice day.
Hello, this is #@Affiliation# counselor #@Name#. How may I help you?
Yes, hello. I would like to take a broadcast camera course or a broadcast technology course.
I'm wondering if I can register since it's not my major
There is no separate major for broadcast camera courses or broadcast technology courses.
In the early 90s, photography-related technical courses gave preference to electronics-related majors.
Since the late 90s, majors have become less important.
However, some broadcasting companies have restrictions on majors such as electronics and electricity.
There are cases where you have to take a written exam related to electronic engineering.
Therefore, it is true that those with a related major are at an advantage when applying for a terrestrial broadcaster's broadcasting technology position.
It is true that majors have an advantage, but there are no restrictions for non-majors either.
Yes, do you have any other questions?
No, there is none
This was counselor #@name# Thank you and have a nice day.
Hello, this is #@Affiliation# counselor #@Name#. How may I help you?
Yes, hello. I have a question about the composition writer.
What are you curious about about the composer?
I'm old, but can't I be a composer when I'm old?
When hiring a writer, the items evaluated are idea composition ability, script ability, organizational adaptability, and sense.
There are various factors such as external relations, data collection, and interpersonal relationships, and these are evaluated comprehensively.
So, among the various evaluation items, age is taken into consideration.
It is rare for age to be the deciding factor in hiring or not hiring.
Also, the broadcasting station's hiring of scriptwriters is always open to those with skills.
Age does not determine eligibility
For example, there are people who can't find a job even at the age of 23, and there are people who find a job at the age of 30.
Yes, I understand.
This was counselor #@name# Thank you and have a nice day.
Hello, this is #@Affiliation# counselor #@Name#. How may I help you?
Yes, hello, I have a question about the composition writer.
What are you curious about about the composer?
Are all the writers freelance?
Some terrestrial programs are produced by independent production companies.
Although we do hire writers as full-time employees, only a very small number are employed, and most are freelancers.
For freelance writers, one episode is broadcast based on the program being broadcast.
How much is the author's fee paid and there is no separate compensation such as retirement bonus
Most of the writers are freelancers
Yes, do you have any other questions?
No, there is none
This was counselor #@name# Thank you and have a nice day.
Hello, this is #@Affiliation# counselor #@Name#. How may I help you?
Yes, hello. I would like to inquire about women's employment.
Oh, you're right about women's employment.
Are there no women in the broadcast technology course?
Women make up about forty percent of the riders.
Also, support from women is increasing recently.
There are more female applicants than I thought.
Yes, it is increasing a lot. Do you have any other questions?
No, there is none
This was counselor #@name# Thank you and have a nice day.
Thanks for the detailed explanation
Hello, this is #@Affiliation# counselor #@Name#. How may I help you?
Yes, hello. I have some questions about applying to the Department of Cultural Production.
Oh, yes, are you talking about applying to the Department of Cultural Production?
Yes, yes, does the Department of Cultural Production only conduct document screening?
The entire process is based on document screening and some consultations as needed before announcing successful candidates.
Is there a limit on the amount of documents submitted for document screening?
There is no limit to the length of the self-introduction and motivation for application written during document screening.
If the purpose and motivation for applying to the course are clear, you will be accepted without any additional procedures.
Yes, thank you for the detailed explanation.
Do you have any further questions?
No, there is none

Yes, hello. I applied for this program for my child this time.
Do parents also need to sign up separately to check progress?

In the case you just mentioned, you must have one parent account.
Now you can manage the learning of both children with one parent account.
Well, I guess it would be better to sign up in advance. Thanks for the explanation.

No, I don't think there's anything in particular
Okay, have a nice day. This was counselor #@name#
Hello, this is #@Affiliation# counselor #@Name#. How may I help you?
Yes, hello. I signed up for #@affiliation# simple membership yesterday.
Is it possible to log in using an email address?
Yes, then you want to do both #@affiliation# linking and email address login at the same time.
Yes, that's right. I was wondering if it was possible.
Yes, you can. Click on Start with Email to register.
Yes, then can I register my email with the email account registered to #@affiliation#?
Yes, that's right. You must enter the email address registered in #@affiliation# to be able to link together.
Yes, I understand. I thought it wouldn't work, but it does.
Yes, do you have any further questions?
No, there is none
Yes, then do your best today too. This was counselor #@name#
Hello, this is #@Affiliation# counselor #@Name#. How may I help you?
Yes, I tried to sign up, but it said there was already an existing ID.
In the case you mentioned, you may have signed up before but forgotten.
Or, it may occur if the ID you entered is already being used by someone else.
Oh, yes, then it is impossible to sign up twice with the same ID.
Yes, that's right. Unfortunately, you cannot register multiple IDs.
Oh, I see. That's why it didn't work. I have to make a new one.
Yes, that's right. Do you have any further questions?
No, I don't think there is anything in particular
Yes, then have a good day today. This was counselor #@name#
Yes, thank you for letting me know.
Hello, this is #@Affiliation# counselor #@Name#. How may I help you?
Yes, hello, I would like to apply for #@product#, what should I do?
Oh yes, you are talking about #@product#
Yes, that's right. I was introduced to #@product# because it was said to be good.
Yes, for #@product#, there is a separate page where you can take the course.
You can take classes after logging in through a separate contract with #@affiliation#
Oh, then it is possible to do so after signing the contract on the separate #@product# course registration page.
Yes, that's right, you're right.
Oh, I understand. Then, if there's anything you don't know, can I call this number?
If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to contact us again.
Yes, I understand. Thank you.
Yes, then please be careful of Corona. This was the counselor #@name#
Hello, this is #@Affiliation# counselor #@Name#. How may I help you?
Yes, hello. Do I need to be authenticated when signing up?
Yes, that's right. When you sign up for email membership, you will need to verify your email address once.
Oh, yes, then how about signing up for #@affiliation#?
#@Affiliation# In the same way, when signing up for membership, there is an email registered to the #@Affiliation# account.
You must verify that email
In conclusion, it seems that identity verification is absolutely necessary, through email, etc.
Yes, that's right. We ask for your understanding for a safer usage environment.
Oh yes, of course I should. Thank you for letting me know.
Yes, do you have any additional questions?
No, nothing in particular
Yes, then have a happy day today. This was counselor #@name#
Hello, this is #@Affiliation# counselor #@Name#. How may I help you?
Yes, hello. I live in Italy. Can I sign up from abroad?
Yes, of course it is possible.
Oh, I have a foreign cell phone, so I think the identity verification process will be difficult.
Oh yes, we have a system where you can sign up by authenticating with your email.
You can sign up from anywhere as long as you can verify your email.
Oh, I didn't know that. Then I guess I can just email it.
Yes, do you have any additional questions?
Oh, do I have to verify my email address to log in and continue?
No, just verify your email the first time.
From then on, you can enter by entering only your ID and password.
Yes, thank you so much for letting me know.
Yes, then please be careful of Corona. This was the counselor #@name#
Anyone can become an expert Hello, I am #@Affiliation# counselor #@Name#
Yes, thank you for your hard work. I signed up by email and am using it.
Yes, thank you for using our service. What part are you curious about?
Can I use the registered email account and #@affiliation# account at the same time?
Yes, it is possible. Is the email address registered to #@affiliation# also the same address?
Oh no, this is my personal email, it's a little different from my business email.
Oh, I'm sorry, but you must use the same email address to proceed with the integration.
Oh really, I didn't know that
Yes, if you really need it, send me your personal email address with #@affiliation#
After registering one more, you can do the same for #@affiliation#
Oh, that's complicated. I'll just link it again with my personal business email.
Oh, yes, that's fine. Do you have any further questions?
No, there is none
Okay, have a nice day. This was counselor #@name#
Hello, this is #@Affiliation# counselor #@Name#. How may I help you?
Yes, hello. I registered for the course and applied for the course, but I can't see the course.
Oh, yes, sir. Then I think we need to check a few things together.
Yeah, what should I check?
First, please make sure you have registered for the course and logged in with the account you used to pay.
Wait a minute, oh I made a mistake
Oh, did you log in with a different account?
I registered for the course by logging in as #@affiliation#, but it came from a different email address.
Oh, yes, then please log in again and the problem will be solved.
Yes, that's right, thank you
Yes, the daily temperature difference is severe, so be careful not to catch a cold. This was counselor #@name#.
Hello, this is #@Affiliation# counselor #@Name#. How may I help you?
No, it's just that I don't remember my password.
Oh, don't worry, I'll help you.
Thank you, what should I do?
First of all, did you sign up with #@affiliation# or did you sign up by email registration?
Well, I registered by email.
Yes, then click Start with Email below the login window.
Click on the Find Password button and then click on your email account.
You can reset it again
Oh, I see, this is how you find your password. Thank you.
Yes, do you have any further questions?
No, there's nothing else
Yes, please try it and if there is anything that doesn't work, please call me. This is the counselor #@name#.
Hello, this is #@Affiliation# counselor #@Name#. How may I help you?
Yes, hello. I'm the person who called earlier about retrieving your password.
Yes, yes, have you encountered any other problems?
When I tried to find it, it told me to check another email address.
In that case, the email address you entered is not a registered account.
Oh, so that means I logged in as #@affiliation#
Yes, that could be possible, or you can check another email address
Oh, yes, I will do that.
Yes, please try again and if anything doesn't work, please contact me anytime like I did just now.
There is news of rain in the afternoon, so prepare an umbrella. This was counselor #@name#.

Well, it's not that inconvenient, but it's inconvenient to have to go there once in a while during work.
Yes, I understand. First of all, I apologize for the inconvenience.
In the case of #@affiliation#, you can block the #@affiliation# channel on the #@affiliation# home page.
What if I have both email and #@affiliation#?
For your email, please go to Edit Member Information and cancel your consent to receive marketing information.
Yes, thank you for letting me know.
Yes, is there anything else you would like to know?
No, there is none
Yes, I will become a #@affiliation# that works harder in the future. Thank you.
Hello, this is #@Affiliation# counselor #@Name#. How may I help you?
Yes, hello. Can I create multiple accounts?
You can create multiple accounts if you use different email addresses.
Is it impossible with one ID?
Yes, that's right. There is a policy against sharing IDs.
Please note that you cannot access multiple devices simultaneously with one ID.
Yes, I understand. I didn't know there was such a policy. I will make sure to follow it.
Yes, is there anything else you would like to know?
Are there any disadvantages to simultaneous connections?
Yes, you will be logged out first, and if this issue is confirmed more than 10 times, you will be blocked.
Yes, thank you so much for the detailed explanation.
Yes, then enjoy your lunch. This was counselor #@name#
Hello, this is #@Affiliation# counselor #@Name#. How may I help you?
Yes, hello. Is there any separate document I need to submit when signing up for membership?
There are no special documents to submit, just sign up with your email and #@affiliation#
Yes, it's simpler than you think. Just choose one of the two and sign up.
Yes, that's right. Do you have any further questions?
What are the customer service center's operating hours?
Yes, we are open weekdays from 10am to 7pm.

In that case, you must withdraw after the usage period for all products ends.

Have a nice day, counselor #@name#
Thank you for your inquiry. This is counselor #@Affiliation#, #@Name#
Hello, I am a prospective high school freshman.
Hello, how may I help you?
I'm signing up for membership and I searched for the school name.
My school name is not searchable
If the school is new or the school name has changed, the search may not be possible.
Oh, our school is a new school.
New schools may take a little longer to register
Then should I wait?
Since this is before entering high school, you can search for nearby schools and enter the school name.
Then can I change it later?
Yes, it will change
Yes, I understand. Thank you.
Have a nice day, this was counselor #@name#
Thank you for your inquiry. This is counselor #@Affiliation#, #@Name#

I'm trying to change my name
Your name cannot be changed.
I changed my name, what should I do? Is there no other way?

Yes, I understand. Thank you.

I'm trying to sign up, but it says I'm already signed up.
If so, it seems like you signed up with the same information or are a dormant member.

Yes, hello. Is it possible to deduct education expenses when filing your year-end tax return?
Oh, I'm sorry, but it seems like it'll be difficult.
It's difficult for some reason
Tuition deductions are only available for facilities designated by #@affiliation#
Oh, so you're saying it's not included in that facility?
Yes, since it is not a company authorized by #@affiliation#, it is not eligible for tax deduction.
Oh, yes, I understand. I will pay attention to the part you mentioned.
Yes, do you have any further questions?
No, there is none
Yes, then please be careful of Corona. This was the counselor #@name#

Oh, then we can issue you a document that can prove your course registration.
Could you please tell me your name and course name?
Your name is #@name# and the process is #@product#
Yes, member #@name#, we have confirmed your identity. Shall we send it to you by email?
Please send it to my email or is there another way?
Another way is by postal service, but it takes some time.
Oh, just send it to me by email. Thank you.
Okay, I understand. Have a nice day. This was counselor #@name#.
Hello, this is #@Affiliation# counselor #@Name#. How may I help you?
Yes, hello. Can several people listen together with just one ID?
It is possible for multiple people to gather on one device and listen.
Oh, then how about listening to it on your phone using my ID?
I'm sorry, but the case you mentioned is a generally taboo act.
If you access multiple devices with one ID, you may be blocked later.
I didn't know, sorry, but it seems like I keep getting logged out
Yes, please be careful because you will be blocked after 10 attempts.
Okay, I understand. I should tell my friends about it.
Yes, do you have any further questions?
No, nothing else

You can obtain a certificate without a separate exam when you graduate.

Yes, what are you curious about?
The requirements for transfer to the third year are completion of the second year and completion of at least 70 credits.
I completed my second year of college with 67 credits. Can I apply?
Will you complete the second year of a four-year university and earn 67 credits?
Yes, all correct
In this case, you cannot transfer as a third-year student.
Transfer to the second year is possible
Is it because of the grades or because I completed the second year?
If you do not meet the required credits, you can transfer to the second year.
Yes, I see. I understand.

Hello, this is #@Affiliation# counselor #@Name#. How may I help you?
I can't register my public certificate.
Are you having trouble registering your public certificate?
I registered a certificate on the main homepage, but it doesn't work.
You must register on the university website, not the main page.
Then I guess I'll have to register again
Yes, and when you registered the certificate, did you use the general purpose one?
No, I just did it normally
Obtain and register a public certificate from the website of the bank you use.
After registering for a general public certificate, you can log in to the school website using your student number.
Yes, I see. I understand.
Thank you #@Affiliation# Counselor #@Name#
This is your friendly #@affiliation# counselor #@name#. How may I help you?
I'm trying to log in but it doesn't work
Are you unable to log in at all?
I registered a public certificate, but I can't log in.
The first day of school is September 1st. Can I log in from the 1st?
No, you can log in even before the start of the semester.
Then why doesn't it work? Was the public certificate not registered properly?
Please tell me your name and contact information to confirm your public certificate registration.
My name is #@name# and my phone number is #@phone number#
I checked and it says the public certificate is not registered
I thought I registered correctly, but it's not working?
Yes, please try registering again and if it doesn't work, please contact me.
Okay, I understand. I'll try again.

I would like to inquire about classes when transferring.
Yes, what is your inquiry?
If you transfer, you will be registered as a third year student.
Do I only need to complete the third and fourth year coursework, excluding the first and second year coursework?
Even if you are a third-year transfer student, you can still apply for first-year and second-year courses.
Then I wonder if all the required subjects related to the qualification have been completed.
If the required subjects for the desired qualification are in the lower grades, you must apply and take them.
I guess I have to apply to get in.
Yes, it is a required subject so you cannot miss it.
Yes, I understand. Thank you.

Yes, yes, how do I get a job after completing the voice acting course?

Hello, this is #@Affiliation# counselor #@Name#. How may I help you?
Yes, hello. I have a question about voice actor support, so I'm contacting you.
What part of voice actor support are you curious about?
Can only women be voice actors?
Voice actor recruitment is divided into male and female categories.
The gender ratio is set and the successful candidates are calculated.
There are fewer male applicants, so the competition rate is lower than that of female applicants.
The average sex ratio these days is about three to seven times that of men to women.
Thank goodness I thought they only picked women
Do you have any further questions?
No, the part I was curious about has been resolved
This was counselor #@name# Thank you and have a nice day.
Thanks for the detailed explanation
Hello, this is #@Affiliation# counselor #@Name#. How may I help you?
Hello, I have a question about the broadcast camera job.
What are you curious about in broadcast camera related jobs?
Are there many women in broadcast camera related jobs?
Are you curious about the female ratio?
I can't see your women very well.
It's about twenty percent compared to men.
However, in the camera industry, which was a male-dominated field, starting in the mid-1990s,
Women's support and advancement continues to grow.
The percentage of women is very low
Do you have any further questions?
No, there is none

If you pass the GED, they'll let you take the CSAT right away.
First, it is possible to take the high school equivalency exam right after graduating from middle school.
Yes, that is possible. Then what do I need?
If you have a middle school graduation certificate and a high school graduation certificate, you can submit it.
Fortunately, it's not as difficult as I thought.
It's possible if you prepare the documents.
But there are people who do that
Yes, there are cases where people drop out and take the high school equivalency exam.

I don't know what to do to get my middle school diploma recognized.
So you also graduated from middle school in Canada?
Yes, that's right. I graduated from middle school, but I didn't go to high school.
You need to get a notarized certificate proving that you graduated from a middle school abroad.
You must go through the process of notarizing and verifying your academic credentials.
You also need to get the documents notarized.

Hello, I have a question about class assignment.
Do you have any questions?
What documents are required for reassignment?

My name is #@name# and my number is #@phone#
Member, this course is only available to students who have taken the Language and Media Final.
That's it, so I can't hear it?
Unfortunately, you cannot apply. Do you have any other inquiries?

Take care not to catch a cold #@Affiliation# This was counselor #@Name#
Thank you for waiting. You said that the words or sentences are not appearing.
If so, please check with one of the members who is not visible.
Can you access the LMS site now?
I'm connected now
Yes, in the LMS site membership management menu, you can see the member name that is not visible.
If you look at the information modification field, you can see what the learning mode is currently in.
I'm in learning mode right now
Is this a prize? If this is a prize, then
Because there are parts where the subtitles are not visible
Yeah, it shouldn't be like that
If you want to see the subtitles, just change to the learning mode.
Okay, I understand.
Yes, do you have any other questions?
No, it's okay. Thank you for your hard work.
I was a former counselor #@name#. Have a cool and healthy day. Thank you.
Yes, hello, I'm from #@affiliation#. Your mother asked me.
I heard that when you study this, the clock makes a sound and you can't move on to the next step.
I contacted you. Do you have any remaining lessons? #@Name#Member
The teacher said I could do it with a pad, so I did it with a pad.
There's something I didn't do today
Then I'll take a look. Turn on the remote. #@Other# Could you please open the homepage?
You are currently logged in
If you look at the bottom left, you will see Remote Support in red.
Yes, click on remote assistance.
Yes, please click on that and click on Run in order at the bottom of Start Remote Support.
If you press it, it will ask you to press a number.
Yes, press start
You will get a number to press
The number I'm pressing doesn't come up, and this is just a pop-up window.
When I press start, a pop-up window appears.
Just click Start Remote Assistance
It keeps saying run run
Okay, just a moment. I'll check and call you back.
This is #@Affiliation# #@Name# working with customers. How can I help you?
I was studying on a learning device, but the device malfunctioned, so I'm studying on my cell phone.
I went back to the study machine and studied on my phone.
It was written again in the learning machine
You changed your device and studied with a universal app.
You logged into the learning machine again.
You said that the textbook you studied was floating in the app.
Are you a mother by any chance?
No, I'm a teacher. Yes, I'll give you the member's phone number.
First of all, your membership number is #@number#
#@Name# Is this correct?
Is the person calling you teacher #@Affiliation# #@Name#?
Yes, I am a member of #@Name#. I am #@Name#
Yes, thank you for the valuable information, sir. So where is the device now?
The device is now at the student's home.
Then, can you confirm what time you can call?
Okay, then I'll check what time your mother is available and call you back.
This is #@Affiliation# #@Name# with customers. How can I help you?
Hello, my child is now taking classes here at home.
There are a few problems with this
Hello, what is your problem?
For example, changing the letters inside a square.
When you listen to the words being made, there are pictures and alphabet words.
Yes, please continue speaking.
There are times when there is a picture and the picture touch doesn't work.
I'm taking a class with my uncle's pad, and he says that if you touch the picture, it makes a sound.
Sometimes, even if you touch it, there is no sound.
Yes, you said that even if you touch it, there is no sound
It is difficult for us, and we have a separate learning consulting team.
I'll contact you separately. Should I call you on the number you just gave me?
Yes, please call the number now.
Okay, I understand. I'll get back to you shortly.
This is #@Affiliation# #@Name# with customers. How can I help you?
I couldn't check the tab serial number earlier.
Okay, can you check it now?
Yes, here is #@affiliation#
I'll check it out. Could you please wait a moment?
Yes, I understand. Thank you.
Yes, thank you for waiting. Please click on the customer center above the terminal information.
Would you like to press the Customer Center Authentication button?
Please wait a moment. This is customer center authentication.
Yes, I will guide you through the code. They are all numbers. #@number#
#@Number# confirmed
Please confirm that the learning mode is turned on.
Yes, that's right
Would you like to change it to off?
I understand that it is changed to Off.
Yes, please click on cancel service and complete the confirmation.
If you've gotten this far, delete it slowly in two or three steps.
You will see on the screen that it says “Confirm Removal”. Would you like to proceed with the removal?
Yes it was deleted
Can you check the tablet PC screen?
Yes, I see your screen
Yes, you can use it. Do you have any other questions?
No, it's okay. There isn't any.
This is #@Affiliation# #@Name# working with customers. How can I help you?
Hello, that's a learning tool. We used our #@product#.
#@Product# I used a pad
So, if I don't learn this #@name#, I can't use it as a regular pad?
#@Affiliation# You mean the #@Product# pad that you were learning about?
It seems like you want to stop learning about the #@product# and change the menu.
Mom, you are currently using our #@product#
Could you please tell me your mother's contact information so that I can verify your membership?
Yes, my number is #@phone#
I have now confirmed that you are the mother of member #@name#. Is this correct?
Yes, can I change it to a regular pad?
Mom, now #@Product#Pad can be changed to the general menu.
Our technical support team within our customer center can now help you with this.
Okay, then please connect me to the technical support team.
Yes, mother, please wait a moment.
Hello, I am contacting you to inform you of the inquiry you made earlier.
Have you tried it with a different device?
Yeah, everything else is the same.
You said your password was #@number#
Could you please tell me your name and membership number?
#@Name# Date of birth is #@Number#
Please tell me only your seven-digit membership number, not your date of birth.
I'm not sure right now
Could you please check it now?
We need to verify your membership number before we can send it to you.
No, it doesn't work unless you have a membership number
Yes, sorry, but I need to verify your membership number.
Computer #@Other# is currently having trouble connecting
No, not now. Then I'll check and get back to you.
Please check and contact #@number# and we will help you.
This is #@Affiliation# #@Name# with customers. How can I help you?
The #@product# app is not showing up on my device right now. What should I do?
If you have a device that does not support app installation at all,
We also have the latest models, so this is not a confirmed model.
If you make a purchase and the app is not displayed
At that time, we will first check whether manual installation is possible.
You can make a request through our technical support team.
However, it is difficult to support devices that do not support app installation.
Then, can you confirm whether I can tell you the model now or not?
Actually, that's the difficult part. What you want to buy is the latest model.
No, that's not true
Well, since it's a new device, we can't really give you a definitive answer.
If you happen to have something used or something you're using,
You can just go to the Play Store and search for it.
Once you search, there is a 90 percent chance that you will be able to install the app.
Yes, but it's usually okay
Yes, I searched for possible apps and installed them.
Sometimes, there are models that are not supported.
Well, in the case of models like #@Product#, the evaluation app does not support it.
Yeah, okay, what should I do then?
It might be a bit of a hassle, but the #@product# evaluation app
Actually, it doesn't matter if you do it on a PC.
Yeah, just with a computer.
In that case, there is no problem, but we are not 100% sure either.
I have to look at this list and then say whether it is okay or not based on the model name.
It's a bit difficult to confirm whether or not
Yes, I understand. Thank you.
Yes, I'm so sorry I can't give you a definite answer.
This is #@Affiliation# #@Name# with customers. How can I help you?
I contacted you because of the learning machine, and you said there was a learning machine consulting team.
Could you please move this over there and take a look?
Yes, Mom, we can do it remotely.
If you have the learning device now and you call me now, I will help you check it.
Yes, I understand.
Yes, do you have any other questions? Oh, you said Galaxy Tab.
Is this the #@Product# tab you purchased from our #@Product#?
No, I didn't buy it here.
Do you just have a separate device?
It's what your baby's uncle used to use.
Okay, no other questions.
Yes, no more, thank you
I am #@name#. Have a healthy and cool day. Thank you.
This is #@Affiliation# #@Name# working with customers. How can I help you?
Hello, there's no one else but #@affiliation#, right? Isn't that machine there?
It's not charging very well now.
It's been about a year since I started studying.
Yes, I am contacting you because charging is not working properly.
Excuse me, but are you the mother of member #@name#?
So, I'm curious as to when you purchased the learning machine.
Yes, I'm going to the AS Center.
He asked me if it had been over a year or not.
He kept saying that he needed a certificate.
I will check my purchase history.
It is confirmed that you purchased #@Product# on July 3, 2017.
It's been a little over a year, I see.
It's been a little over a year
Then I think you should ask AS
Okay, then I'll check it out. Thank you.
This is #@Affiliation# #@Name# working with customers. How can I help you?
After requesting cancellation, you are only supposed to do this on your current device.
Where should I resolve that?
As for that part, we can cancel that service.
Mother, please ask the center to stop learning or something like that.
Is the tab #@product#? What is your mother's model?
I think it's not #@product# but #@product#pad
#@Affiliation# #@Product# I will handle that part right now.
Do you have a Wi-Fi connection right now?
We can help you set it up.
I'm connected to wifi now
Yes, I understand. I will proceed with canceling the learning period right away.
Then, if you cancel the learning period, everything here will be deleted.
Yes, our program is being deleted.
What happens if I apply again next time?
If you reapply, we will set it up again.
Then let me think about it a little more
Yes, I understand. Please check and contact me.
This is #@Affiliation# #@Name# with customers. How can I help you?
Yes, it's nothing else. There are sentences to review the words in that #@product#.
Why don't the sentences or letters that appear when review words appear?
Yes, when you review words or sentences in #@Product#, you can't see the text.
I can't see your handwriting so I keep talking.
Are all members experiencing the same symptoms?
Not all of them, but they appear here and there. They appear a lot now.
Are you saying that not all of your members are like that, but just a few of them?
You are saying that you can't see the word letters. Could you please wait a moment?
Yes, please check.
I think I need to connect you to the person in charge now. Would you like me to connect you?
Yes, please connect me
This is #@Affiliation# #@Name# working with customers. How can I help you?
I asked for confirmation earlier because the name didn't appear. When will it be synchronized?
Do you need to start studying today?
Yes, I have to visit today.
We will process your request for a quicker synchronization.
Yes, I understand. Thank you.
Do you have any other questions?
No, there isn't, thank you
I was a former counselor #@name#. Have a cool and healthy day. Thank you.
Yes, thank you. Thank you for your hard work.
This is #@Affiliation# #@Name# with customers. How can I help you?
Yes hello my tablet is currently in #@product# mode
I'm planning to use this on the internet too.
You said you use the internet and study together?
Yes, that's right. I want to write with you.
Yes, mother, I will check the information first and then give you guidance.
Excuse me, what is the name of the child you are studying with?
Your name is #@name#
Yes, please tell me the last four digits of your registered phone number.
Your phone number is #@phone#
Thank you for confirming your valuable information.
Mom, do you have the study materials right now?
No, I don't have it right now.
Then please find the study material and call me back.
Okay, I'll call you back then.
This is #@Affiliation# #@Name# with customers. How can I help you?
Hello, I am a member of Smart #@Product# and I have that machine.
#@Product# I dropped the machine and the LCD screen cracked.
Yes, your LCD is cracked.
Yes, that's why the touch doesn't work. It turns on and off.
Yes, it works, but the touch doesn't work.
So the touch screen doesn't work and the LCD is cracked like this. What should I do?
What new should I buy? What should I do?
Excuse me, but are you the mother of member #@name#?
Yes #@name#, that's right mom
It appears that member #@Name# is learning.
Yes, that's right #@name# is using it
Yes, please check the last digits of your registered mobile phone number for accurate consultation.
Your last digit is #@number#
Thank you for checking. This is the learning device my mother used.
#@Product# Is this a product? #@Product# Is this a product?
This is the #@product# product
#@Product# Is this a product? But I dropped it and the LCD is cracked, but the phone still turns on.
If you find it inconvenient to learn because you can't touch it, then it's inconvenient.
You should go to the #@affiliation# service nearest to your home and check.
Please check how much the service costs.
Yes, go to the service center.
Yes, please visit our service center.
The first person you contacted was #@name#. The call volume is high.
I think you've been reconnected with us
If you don't mind, I'd like to help you with your reservation.
Yes, please make a reservation.
If possible, what is the customer's mobile phone number that can be used to check membership?
But I have that as my cell phone number
Please tell me first
I need to be registered as a member so I can make a reservation.
Your number is #@phone#
You said #@name# earlier, so first of all, what you asked about is
Since this is our textbook section, what is the name of the textbook?
The textbook is #@guitar#
#@Other# is left now
I told you that it won't work
You're saying it's not coming out? The establishment is #@Other#, right? You're saying it's been established?
Yes, it is.
Teacher, are you in class between 4 and 5? Can I talk to you?
#@Name# Our learning support team will be calling you.
I'll contact you again between 4 and 5 o'clock.
Yes, I understand. Thank you.
Nice to meet you, I am #@Affiliation# #@Name#
You fixed the problem that was being transferred remotely earlier.
Here, when you do this and solve problem number one,
There was something like a chart next to it, right? That wasn't there either.
After solving a problem once, it takes a while before it clicks and moves on.
The next problem, this one, didn't go through.
I'll try to reconnect remotely. You set the screen ratio to 100%.
Yes, I did it 100%
If you try this once on a small screen, it will come out like this.
You can see that, so this screen should always be set to 100%.
Yeah, that's why it was like that
If you look at the bottom here, this is why it happened.
If you look at it now, it looks normal
If you solve the problem here and click on the answer and click on &quot;I solved it all&quot; here
This is what you'll move on to next, so everything else is the same.
This time, three times, four times, five times, write the answer to this too. I solved it all. Just press it.
I think that crackling sound is because there's about two minutes for each problem.
It was almost over after that so that must have been why
So, then this doesn't work, so what's wrong?
Okay, then I'll try to get it right 100% later today.
Yes, before you do, please check this.
Yes, I understand. Thank you.
If you just click on this and press the inverted triangle here, this will appear.
You just have to get it 100% right.
Okay, I understand. Is that okay?
Yes, it is. Thank you.
Yes, thank you. Thank you for your hard work.
This is #@Affiliation# #@Name# working with customers. How can I help you?
Yes, I told my teacher on Thursday that I was quitting the class.
I just gave you the remaining three textbooks.
But when will all the refunds and stuff like that be decided?
Are you talking about a textbook refund?
Now I go into that What is it tab and I'm still a member
I wonder when the organizing will be finished
Yes, please let me know the learner's name so that we can proceed with the consultation accurately.
Please also check the last four digits of your mobile phone number.
#@Name# is here and #@Phone# is here
Thank you for confirming the valuable information.
So, have you finished studying the textbook you received, other than the one you just returned?
Yeah, that day was over
Yes, then you are still saying that you want to refund the textbook?
Didn't you receive this part too?
Yes, I just told the teacher that day and gave him all the textbooks.
Later, I asked him to tell me the rest of the story in text, but he didn't say anything.
I will contact the teacher in charge and inform you about that part.
Yes, please tell them to contact me a little faster.
Okay, I understand. Please wait a moment.
Hello, customer.
Hello, yes, hello
#@Name# Member, are you a customer?
Yes, that's right, it's me
Customer, you have returned home now.
Yes, I'm in. Please speak.
Yes, then turn on the learning device while it is connected to Wi-Fi.
Yes, I connected to wifi.
If you look at the top left, you will see the word “Settings”. Click on the word “Settings”.
Customer, at the very bottom, there is terminal information.
Could you please tell me the serial number that starts with #@number#?
Terminal information #@number#
Yes, thank you for checking. If you look on the left, please click on Customer Center.
A, Click on Customer Center Authentication and I will give you the number.
Yes, I pressed the customer center authentication button.
Yes, please enter #@number#
Please click on Confirm Completion
Yes, I pressed #@number# Done
Are you sure you have been authenticated?
It doesn't say it's been authenticated
If you have any difficulties, shall I connect you to the technical team?
Please connect me to your technical team.
Okay, then I'll connect you to the technical team.
This is #@Affiliation# #@Name# working with customers. How can I help you?
Can I just use the terminal as a pad?
Yes, it is possible because you stopped studying.
Would you mind switching to a regular tablet, Mom?
After stopping studying, it is time to switch to a regular tablet.
Excuse me, but are you the mother of member #@name#?
In order to proceed with the consultation accurately, I would like to ask you one thing.
Can you please check the last four digits of the contact number registered with us?
Yes, that's right #@phone number#
Yes, thank you for confirming the valuable information. Mom, do you have the device now?
This is only possible if you are connected to Wi-Fi.
I'm not connected to wifi right now
Then, would you please connect and contact me?
Okay, I understand. Then I'll connect and get back to you.
Hello, this is technical team #@name#
You said it was difficult to authenticate. Did you enter the authentication number correctly?
Yes, I pressed it correctly.
Would you like to press it one more time?
Yes, the authentication screen just popped up.
Yes, then is the learning-only mode now confirmed to be on?
It's set to learn-only mode.
Please change it to Off. If you look at the bottom, it says Cancel service.
Yes, I will cancel your service.
Yes, click on the service cancellation text and when the confirmation button appears, click on the confirmation button.
You will see the message “Do you want to delete?” Then click Delete.
That doesn't show up
Please wait a moment and the deletion will be completed.
Yes, it's up now
This is deleted, right?
Yes, please delete it and try deleting it again.
It has been switched to a normal tablet screen, sir.
Yes, the screen is up
Yes, now the setup is complete and you can use it.
Yes, I will use it. Thank you.
Do you have any further questions?
No, thank you for your answer
This is #@Affiliation# #@Name# working with customers. How can I help you?
I contacted you earlier because the learning machine wasn't working, but I don't know my membership number.
Then, is it difficult to confirm the parents' contact information?
Parents' contact information, please.
Yes, please confirm.
This is because of personal information.
No, this member's information must be verified accurately.
We can forward this to the department and have it processed.
But it may be difficult to confirm with just the name right now
We don't have a separate way to look up your date of birth. It's a bit difficult to find it by just looking up your date of birth.
Because I don't go to that site
I'll go to the site a little later, get the membership number, and contact you.
You can't immediately check your mother's contact information or your parents' contact information.
I have to go in after looking at it. That should be fine.
Then I'm sorry, but please give me the boss's contact information.
Is this member's password #@number# and #@name#?
Yes, that's right #@Name#
And my phone number is #@phone#
Yes, is #@your number# correct?
Your name is #@name#
Then it may take us some time.
I'll just convey it like this
How many times do you have to press #@number# on the attendance sheet?
Registration is complete. Press F2 again and you will be discharged.
If you do it like this, the attendance sheet will be like this.
In the Grande Learning Machine, you have to press the #@number# to learn.
That's what I'm saying
Yes, I understand. I will pass it on. Yes, thank you. It was #@Name#.
This is #@Affiliation# #@Name# working with customers. How can I help you?
This is #@affiliation# #@product#
Yes, how may I help you?
We signed up a member yesterday and registered.
I told you not to use a learning device
It says to ask the teacher
If you log in to the learning machine #@product#
Are you saying that the phrase &quot;Please ask your teacher&quot; appears?
It's not registered so that's how it is
It says &quot;You are not a registered member&quot; It says &quot;This is not a registered device&quot;
It says I am not a registered member
The member is not a new member either
I'm a new member, I just signed up the day before yesterday.
First, did you register a four-digit password and do the synchronization process?
I synced it, the password is #@number#

There is a student among my students who studied with me before.
I'm getting inquiries about the learning device. This learning device is originally locked.
How do I make it so that I can use all of it just for learning?
So you're asking me to use it as a regular pad?
I am teacher #@name# of classroom #@affiliation# and would like to help you with your guidance.
Yes, #@name# is correct
Yes, it depends on your teacher's device.
You can use it as a regular pad, but do you know what kind of device it is?
It was a very early machine.
In the early days, in the case of early devices,

Yes, lowercase letters
And after the number there are five digits #@number#
Yes, I checked #@number#
If you click on the completion confirmation button, will it say that it has been authenticated?
Yes, it's been verified.
Excuse me, would it be okay if I call you back later?
Okay, then I'll call you back in five minutes.
This is #@Affiliation# #@Name# working with customers. How can I help you?
Yes, our #@product# teacher, I am the student who ordered the textbook on that pad.
My name isn't showing up. Is it because I made the distribution today and it's not showing up yet?

Hello, I am contacting you to provide information regarding your inquiry.
Yes, what should I do?
In addition to the list of downloadable support items available now, here's what we've uploaded:
There have been no further updates since September 2017.
Yeah, the update didn't happen.
So if you need to install the app on the latest model, the first thing is
App installation is absolutely impossible for #@Product# or #@Product#
Yes, I did it in September.
Yes, if the app cannot be installed on #@Product# or #@Product# models.
So, primarily from the Play Store.
#@Product# If you look at the smart bepple and #@Product# evaluation app
You may be able to install the app
Yes, first of all, on the play store.
Okay, then I'll check the store and contact you if it doesn't work.
Yes, please contact me soon.
This is #@Affiliation# #@Name# with customers. How can I help you?
There are a few things I want to check, but the learning machine is weird.
If it's something like crab, change the seed to a different letter.
Now, when you are asked to listen to a word, tap the letter I.
I want the keyboard to come out or something, but it doesn't work
Okay, Mom. First of all, I know it's inconvenient, but thank you for calling.
#@Name# Are you the member's mother? For accurate consultation
Please check only the last four digits of the registered mobile phone number.
Your number is #@number#
Yes, thank you for checking the information. The information you provided is related to the learning machine.
We now have a separate learning consulting team
So I have to relay it to you now, but I'm sorry, I can't connect right away.
How about we make a reservation and call you back?
Yes, please do that. Is that possible today?
How about between eleven and twelve?
Eleven to twelve o'clock is fine.
Yes, can I call you on your mother's cell phone?
Yes, you can give me this number.
Okay, I understand. I will get back to you shortly.
This is #@Affiliation# #@Name# working with customers. How can I help you?
It's been a little over a year since I bought the device and the AS Center said
I'm talking about something like this, like you could change the dashboard or something.
Yes, then I think you should check again with the AS Center
Yes, I understand. Do I need any kind of certificate or something like that?
No, we do not issue separate certificates.
Do I have to submit a certificate there?
Yeah, that's what I was talking about.
Did you say I had to receive it?
Then, when you come back this time, would you please check it carefully and then ask?
Okay, then I'll ask AS. Thank you.
This is #@Affiliation# #@Name# with customers. How can I help you?
I looked at the package here and it costs 90,000 won.
Is it always 99,000 won or is it only 99,000 won for a few months?
The 99,000 won product now requires three visits per month.
Yes, three times a month.
Yes, so this is continuously paid at 90,000 won.
The price there is one hundred and twenty thousand won.
They lined it up and made it worth 90,000 won.
Yes, it's a monthly fee of 9,900 won.
Okay, yes, I understand.
Yes, it was #@name#. Have a nice afternoon.
Yes, I understand. Thank you for your answer.
This is #@Affiliation# #@Name# working with customers. How can I help you?
I initialized the device and I have some questions.
Yes, please tell me
If we install this, the basic apps are already installed and we just need to install them.
If you use #@Other# and log in with your #@Affiliation# account,
You can install other necessary apps
Okay, yes, I understand.
Do you have any further questions?
No, there isn't, thank you
Yes, I hope you have a healthy and refreshing day today. This was counselor #@name#.
Thank you, thank you for your hard work.
This is #@Affiliation# #@Name# working with customers. How can I help you?
I would like to cancel my subscription. My name is #@Name#.
Yes, I have confirmed your name.
Before you cancel, is your mother using a monthly flat-rate plan?
Or is it the automatic transfer every month?
It's probably over. The contract was set to automatic transfer.
Then, please tell the center again that you will stop for the time being.
There has been no distribution history since this past month.
I'll give you the phone number.
Mom, there's nothing you need to ask us for.
No, there is no separate one. It's okay.
I'll give you the number #@phone number#
Okay, then I'll call you and tell you.
Yes, thank you. Have a nice day.
Yes, thank you for your answer.
This is #@Affiliation# #@Name# working with customers. How can I help you?
Yes, hello #@Product# I was doing it but I stopped now
I just want to disable this learning tab
Yes, you are a member who stopped learning.
You want to convert the dedicated learning device you were using into a general tablet and use it.
Yes, that's right
First, please tell me the name of the child you are studying with.
What are the four digits on the back of your mother's registered cell phone?
#@Name# Your number is #@Phone#
Yes, thank you for checking the valuable information. I would like to ask about the learning device you used.
Is #@Product# or #@Product# your device?
Yes, that's right #@product#
Yes, it is #@Product# device and do you have it in your possession now?
I don't have it right now
Then I think it would be difficult to give you guidance right now. Should I keep it with me and contact you?
Okay, I'll find the device and contact you. Thank you.
This is #@Affiliation# #@Name# with our customers.
You asked about the benefits of purchasing a machine this morning.
Yes, that's right, I asked.
Is it true that you said you didn't receive any consultation from the agency?
No, I haven't received any advice.
The teacher came there today and gave us a test.
So, customer, there is a center where you received counseling.
Yes, Gyeongbuk #@Address#
#@Address# Thank you. Is it possible for me to proceed with the consultation accurately?
Can I check your name and phone number?
Yes, my name is #@name# and my number is #@phone#
Dear customer, #@Name# previously made a purchase through a contract.
It is difficult to apply the promotion that is currently in progress.
Is that so? Then how much would it be if I buy it now?
#@Product# is one hundred sixty-five thousand won #@Product# is two hundred forty-nine thousand won
Our #@product# model can be purchased for 149,000 won.
I have to buy it all
Sorry, for now, yes
We are sorry that we do not currently have any events that offer duplicate discounts.
Yeah, that's too bad
This is #@Affiliation# #@Name# working with customers. How can I help you?
I am learning on my phone, and when the student uses the device
My mother said she would help me connect the device.
Okay, then what will be your name?
My name is #@name#
Then, if I call you now
Are you able to make a call with your device, Mom?
No, it's difficult right now. If possible, can you do it later, between 5 and 6 o'clock?
Then we can make a reservation for you.
Please wait a moment for our callback appointment.
The latest possible time is between eight and nine at night.
Is the time that works best for you right now between 5 and 6?
Yes, I have class at 5 o'clock.
The teacher will be there at that time.
Yes, but since your mother is here, I think she can answer the phone.
Or from seven to eight is fine too.
From six to seven
Then when exactly is the best time, sir?
I like 6 to 7 the best
We'll make a reservation for you between 6 and 7 o'clock.
What number should I call to make a reservation?
I think you can call this number #@phone number#
Yes, I will make a reservation for you between 6 and 7 o'clock at #@phone number#.
Yes, I'm #@Affiliation# who just called. What kind of pop-up window did you get?
What are you talking about in English?
Just keep pressing run and the number will come out separately.
Yeah just keep pressing
Then later it will ask you to enter a number.
I see it. Please click on the icon number. It came out.
Yes, please press three times.
This is the third connection. I wonder if I can change it to this program next time.
Yes, please click OK. The connection has been established and I will control it remotely.
First of all, this is now seventy-five percent.
What's your screen ratio?
The screen should always be set to 100% to solve the problem without any other problems.
Yeah, I'll get it right 100%.
I think you should know this because if it's small or big,
What might be causing the clicks to not work?
No, even if it's 100%, there's something that doesn't work.
I hope everything goes well
It came out well now
That's great. Do you have any further questions?
Yes, thank you for your answer. Thanks for your hard work.
This is #@Affiliation# #@Name# with customers. How can I help you?
I was on the phone earlier and the call got disconnected in the middle.
Do you have any questions?
I'm using the device internet, and I even told you the terminal information.
Yes, then the learning mode will be turned on at the top of the screen, Mom.
Yes it is on
Could you please change that to off?
Yeah, I'll turn this off.
Your settings are complete, now press the back button
Please go to the home screen
Yeah go back Yeah okay
Yes, and how do you use it?
Would you like to select Manage Apps in the upper right corner?
Yes, I did the app management here.
Now, in addition to #@product#, there are other programs as well.
Everyone can use it
It works now
Yes, do you have any other questions?
Yes, it's okay, thank you
Yes thank you be happy I was #@name#
This is #@Affiliation# #@Name# with customers. How can I help you?
My tablet device is broken so I'm thinking of buying one.
I have two children. Is there any way?
What will your child's name be?
#@Name# #@Name# It goes like this
When you were learning #@name# before
#@Name# Is this the device you purchased under your name?
Yes, that's right #@name# is the name
Then, member #@name# doesn't have any purchase history yet.
Yes, #@Name# I'm just writing down what my older sister used to write
The reason I'm telling you this is because if you are a member with no purchase history,
If you purchase the #@name# product for 149,000 won now and start learning,
From the third month, you can get textbooks for 40,000 to 50,000 won per month.
If you confirm that you can learn more than three sets using the learning machine,
We check your learning amount every month for ten months and give you a 5,000 won scholarship certificate.
For four ten months.
Then, if you receive it for all ten months, you will receive a total discount of 50,000 won.
I think you can refer to this part and find out the cost of AS.
Yes, I understand. Thank you.
Do you have any other questions?
Yes, no more
Your consultation is #@name#. Have a cool and healthy day.
Yes, thank you. Thank you for your hard work.
This is #@Affiliation# #@Name# working with customers. How can I help you?
Okay, I have a question. My child is about to start playing #@guitar#rule.
Yes, sir
I'm calling to see if there's any benefit to buying your machine.
Excuse me, but the person calling is our parent, right?
#@Other# I think you mean that you are going to start studying now.
Dear customer, have you ever studied #@Other# before?
#@Other# This is my first time learning
Then, at that time, you did not have a separate terminal purchased by the customer.
I bought it and it was broken
Yes, I'm going to buy a new one.
Excuse me, sir. Is there a separate agency that you consulted with?
There is no dealer I consulted with
In that case, we will have to check and contact you again.
Yes, you are supposed to contact me within today, right?
Yes, I will contact you promptly within today.
This is #@Affiliation# #@Name# working with customers. How can I help you?
Is it possible to cancel the application here?
Are you talking about canceling the course?
We no longer offer learning cancellations through our customer service center.
You must make a request through the center that manages your mother.
Excuse me, what is the name of the child you are studying with?
Please tell me the last four digits of your phone number.
#@Name# Your number is #@Phone#
Yes, thank you for confirming the valuable information. Are you saying that you will stop learning now?
For now, it's stopped and I'm not doing it right now.
I'm wondering if I should call customer service to cancel.
We do not request cancellation separately on our side.
You can make a request to your affiliated center.
Could you please give me your phone number?
Shall I give you the phone number?
Mom, I just checked and it is confirmed as #@Other#
Then you have to call #@Other#
Yes, that's right. You can cancel by calling #@Other#.
Nice to meet you, I am #@Affiliation# #@Name#
I wanted to reset the settings, so I did that and the settings were completed.
Yes, what is your problem?
Then, this means that you can access the internet via Wi-Fi.
Yes, you can use it while connected to WiFi.
Yes, I understand. Thank you.
Yes, thank you. Do you have any further questions?
Yes no it's okay
Yes, I am counselor #@name#. Have a cool and healthy day.
Yes, thank you. Thank you for your hard work.
Yes, thank you, customer.
This is #@Affiliation# #@Name# with customers. How can I help you?
Hello, I am a member of Smart #@Product# and I have that machine.
My car broke down and I'm going to take it to the AS center. Do you know the cost?
As far as we know, we don't know the exact cost of AS.
I know that the most expensive repair cost is when the LCD is broken.
Yes, that's why I think it would be better to just buy it.
Yes, but I don't know the exact amount yet.
If you happen to purchase #@affiliated# products again now
You can buy it for one hundred and forty-nine thousand won
Yes, one hundred and forty-nine thousand won.
Okay, so let's check how much the AS costs.
If the cost is too much, buy a new one like your mother suggested.
Yes, I understand. Thank you for your answer.
This is #@Affiliation# #@Name# with customers. How can I help you?
I was on the phone earlier and decided to call you after looking for some study materials.
Are you talking about using the tablet internet?
Yes, we will guide you through the settings after we agree on this part.
You have already done this recording before.
I will check the serial number and let you know right away.
If you touch the mother's settings, you will see terminal information on the left.
Yes, I found the terminal information.
You need to check the serial number there.
Could you please check the number starting with capital letters #@Other#?
Yes, it says #@number# here
#@Number# is correct, yes, thank you for checking.
If you look above the terminal information, you will see that it says Customer Center.
Yes, please enter your code number and I will give you the number.
Yes #@number#, mom
Yes, wait a minute. This is customer service.
If you look above your terminal information, you can see it. Just select Customer Center.
Please tell me your number.
Yes, I will guide you again. It's #@number#.
Your number #@number#
Yes and lastly #@number#
Yes #@number# but I have something to do right now so you can call me later
Yes, it is possible. Please contact me again.
This is #@Affiliation# #@Name# working with customers. How can I help you?
My learning machine is broken. What should I do?
Yes, first of all, thank you for calling me despite the inconvenience.
#@Name# Director, are you sure?
Director, please confirm the name of the operating school base to provide accurate consultation.
Yes #@guitar#headquarters quiet #@guitar#yo
Yes, thank you for checking the information. What are your symptoms?
I'm having trouble logging in right now
The symptom is that you just can't log in.
And then it keeps turning off
Is this a symptom of a shutdown? Does this happen to just one unit, or to multiple units?
I have four out of several right now.
I have nine learning devices connected.
Your family is showing these symptoms right now.
Four out of nine, this could be more than a learning curve.
There may be other symptoms, but please get it checked out first.
I think it would be a good idea to do AS. We will forward it to the relevant department.
Let me help you with more specific advice.
Okay, then can I wait?
Yes, can you contact me on the phone you called me on right now?
Yes, this number is possible
Yes, we will pass it on to the department and call the director again.
This is #@Affiliation# #@Name# working with customers. How can I help you?
I used it as a terminal pad and connected it to Wi-Fi.
I don't know what to do from then on.
Okay, so are you connected to wifi now?
If you say you are ready for that
Please click on the settings text in the upper right corner
Where on the right is the setting?
Yes, if you click on the settings text
At the very bottom there is a phrase that says terminal information.
Yes, you mean the terminal information text.
Click on the terminal information text to find the serial number
Could you tell me that number?
Yes, the number is #@number#
Please tell me #@number# and on the left side there is a sign that says Customer Center.
Please click on the text and I will send you the authentication number.
Mom, the number is #@number# and the number is #@number#
It says can't connect to server
Mom, it looks like your wifi isn't connected
Yes, my Wi-Fi has been authenticating for a while now and it hasn't worked since then.
If it says it's authenticating, it means you entered the wrong password.
It keeps showing up like this because it keeps saving.
You can reboot the shared device just once. It will be confirmed as saved.
Okay, just a moment. I'll call you back later.
Okay, I understand. Do you have any further questions?
This is #@Affiliation# #@Name# working with customers. How can I help you?
Yes, I told my teacher on Thursday that I was quitting the class.
I gave you the textbook and the teacher said he would contact you.
I haven't heard from you yet
Is that so, Mom? If so, what about membership registration and payment?
I don't know anything yet
I know it's inconvenient because it's being held at the #@affiliation# center.
You can check with the center. I will give you the center's contact information.
Yes, I have your contact information.
Yes, I know this part might be a hassle.
You can request confirmation from the center once.
Okay, then I will contact you via the center number.
Yes, thank you #@Affiliation# #@Name#
This is #@Affiliation# #@Name# working with customers. How can I help you?
That charging jack doesn't go in.
Are you saying that the charging jack is not making contact with the charging terminal?
Mom, what is our learner's name?
Your learner is #@name#
Yes, member #@name#, you are my mother. In order to proceed with the consultation normally,
Can you check the last four digits of the contact number registered with us?
The last 4 digits of your number are #@phone number#
Yes, thank you for checking the valuable information. What type of learning device are you currently using?
What kind of plane is it, Mom?
This is now #@product#
Yes, please use a dedicated charging cable or use a mobile phone charger.
I'm doing it exclusively
Yes, Mom, if we look next to that dedicated charging line
There is a terminal called an opin terminal where you can connect a cell phone charging cable.
Yes, over here on the side
Yes, you can use it if you charge it with your cell phone charger, Mom.
Yes, with your cell phone charging cord.
Yes, that's fine, thank you
This is #@Affiliation# #@Name# with our customers.
Yes, #@Product# is broken. I'm thinking of taking it in for repair.
Yes, sir, you can get AS for that product.
#@Product# If it is the same model, you can send it via post office courier.
Yes, you have to send it by post office delivery.
Yes, please describe the symptoms of the learning device in detail before sending it to our manufacturer.
Please take note of it. Just write down your contact information and member name.
Yes, I will send it together like that.
Yes, I will send it to you as a text message for your reference.
Is your contact number #@phone number# where I can receive texts? Mom
Yes, #@phone number# is correct
Yes, I will send you a text message to that number.
Yes, I understand. Thank you.
I am #@Affiliation# #@Name# working with customers. How can I help you?
I'm thinking about buying a tablet, but I have a question.
It says that coupons are applied when taking classes for twelve months now.
For customers who are purchasing a device for the first time from our website,
I'll give you twelve coupons worth 5,000 won each. Now you can pay for your tuition.
You must use the coupon twelve times starting from the second month.
Then you can apply the discount
That just applies to everything
Yes, if you sign up for #@Product# for the first time and purchase a device,
But this only happens when it's your first purchase, regardless of the account you signed up for.
It doesn't matter if the class is in progress now.
The minimum class is in progress, but this is your first time purchasing the device.
Yes this is my first purchase
Yes, then it will be provided twelve times starting from the second month.
I'm sorry, but if I apply for this today, when will it arrive?
Because we are planning to stay abroad for a long time
Is that so, mother? But the payment must be completed before two o'clock.
It will be shipped the same day, and if it is after 2 o'clock, it will be shipped the next day.
And shipping varies from the logistics center to the local courier situation.
It may take one to two days.
Yes, then you can use it right away.
Yes, you can use it right away after setting it up.
Yes, I understand. Thank you.
Yes, I will send you a text right away.
This is #@Affiliation# #@Name# working with customers. How can I help you?
I called you this morning and I'm trying to move my device to another location.
This is what the kid wrote just now, and he said he was on the internet
So he told me to call customer service.
Are you saying that this is a device that is currently being used with general functions open?
Yes, that's right
Yes, I understand. Then, regarding what you just said
We will forward this to our learning consultant and get back to you.
Are you available to talk between 3 and 4 o'clock?
Can I call you right away?
There is no separate direct number, so please call and I will make a reservation for you.
The learning agent is contacting you again.
Yes, please do it as soon as possible.
I will contact you between 3 and 4 o'clock and I will contact you at this number.
Yes, you can call me here.
Do you have any other questions?
No, there isn't, thank you
This is #@Affiliation# #@Name# with our customers.
Yes, the charging jack on the device I applied for this time doesn't work well.
Yes, which one do you use, a dedicated charging cable or a mobile phone charger?
I use it exclusively
If you look next to the charging cable, there is something called an open terminal.
Yes, over here on the side
Yes, you can use it if it is charged with your mobile phone charging cable.
Could you please try connecting the charger now?
But now that I look at it, the gap between the existing charging side and the charging side is quite large.
Can I get this repaired?
Yes, we can do AS if your mother has the symptoms.
Next, I will guide you through the ACE process.
Okay, then please let me fix it.
This is #@Affiliation# #@Name# working with customers. How can I help you?
Yes, I am currently working on #@product#
I want to move the terminal to another place and use it as a different terminal.
Is the person calling you the mother of member #@name#?
Yes, that's right, the last seat is #@phone number#
Yes, thank you for checking the valuable information. It is not our exclusive learning tool right now.
Are you studying by installing a universal learning app?
No, it's a dedicated learning device, but it stutters a bit.
I'm saying this because I want to use it somewhere else
If you do that now, you are studying #@product# with a dedicated learning device.
Are you saying that you are learning the same model on a different device?
Yeah, I have to install this before I can move it back here.
But the network isn't working. What should I do?
Is the device you purchased the same one you used for learning at #@affiliation# before?
I bought it used before
You don't even know what general functions are available.
Yes, I don't know. Then I will check and get back to you.
This is #@Affiliation# #@Name# with our customers.
Yes, the charging jack doesn't go in well.
Are you saying that the charging jack is not making contact with the charging terminal?
What is our learner's name?
Your learner is #@name#
Yes, member #@name#, you are my mother. This is for consultation.
Can you please confirm the four digits on the back of the contact information registered with us?
The last 4 digits of your number are #@phone number#
Yes, thank you for checking the valuable information. It is a learning device model.
What kind of plane is it, Mom?
This is currently being used as a #@product# model
I am #@Affiliation# #@Name# working with customers. How can I help you?
#@Product# I'm taking a class and I'm thinking about ordering a tablet PC.
So you're saying you want to order your own learning device?
Yes, among those learning tools, I'm trying to do #@product#
I'm calling because I can't order online right now.
You are saying that you can't order online?
You can purchase the device on our website.
Excuse me, but in order to proceed with the consultation accurately,
Could you please confirm your child's name?
There are two people, can I call just one? Should I call both of them?
I think you can call me by the name of the member who will purchase the device.
Yes, I am #@name#
#@Name# Please wait a moment
Yes, please check.
Thank you for waiting. Are you a third grade elementary school student #@name#?
Yes, that's right #@name#
Please enter the PC version and enter #@number# and it will not connect.
You must access the site #@URL#
Let me send you the text again just once.
Yes, I did something wrong. Please send me a text.
This is #@Affiliation# #@Name# working with customers. How can I help you?
I called you this morning and I haven't heard back from you about the duplicate distribution.
Yes, I'm sorry for the inconvenience.
Cancellation number #@number# is correct, what is your name?
Yes, teacher #@name#
#@Name# Teacher, how many textbooks have you cancelled?
There are four volumes, but I added one more
It will be marked as five volumes. It is four volumes of AS R.
So you're saying there are textbooks that should be excluded here?
Yes, that's right
Then, please click on Complete Input except for one.
Yes, I pressed complete input
Yes, so you're saying there are a total of four books checked.
Yes, your books are checked now
All of these are duplicate distributions.
Yes, they are all distributed in duplicate.
Yes, I think we should forward it to the department and have them cancel it.
Please check back later, a little after 5pm.
Yes, I will check in the afternoon.
Yes, have a nice day.
This is #@Affiliation# #@Name# with the customer. Is it okay if I call you?
Yes, I can hear you. Go ahead.
Yes, you're connected. Yes, what part of the learning are you having trouble with?
#@Other# I think it's not me who did it, it's the kid who did it
Yes, #@Other# is orange
Even then, I can see the message that downloading has failed.
But I have to do these two things now, but I went there because I couldn't do it.
We reset it on the thirteenth day, but it still doesn't work?
No, I did it since then, but starting yesterday, if you just do this, it's over.
First of all, this symptom actually disappears when I initialize it.
But if you say it looks like this again, did you make any updates in the meantime?
I don't think I've done it, but if I just do this now
We're not going to learn anymore.
Yes, we have confirmed that the information we provided at that time was the genuine method.
Yes, the teacher is coming today, so when the child comes, he has to do this.
Yes, then your mother's power may have been turned off. Then it will reboot again.
I did a factory reset and it will turn back on.
Please come back, connect to Wi-Fi, and then log in.
What, when the update message comes up, you will start learning again.
I'm so sorry for bothering you so much when there's not much learning left.
Yes, first of all, do you have any other questions?
No, there isn't, yes
When the device turns on, just log in and connect to Wi-Fi.
Yes, I understand. Thank you.
Yes thank you have a nice day counselor #@name#
This is #@Affiliation# #@Name# working with customers. How can I help you?
Yes, hello, I am teacher #@name# from Mapo Sangam branch.
Yes, teacher, please speak.
#@Name#
A child named Lee quit after three months
What is my membership number?
My membership number is #@number#
Yes sir, I checked
Yes, I believe the payment made this month was cancelled.
I think the director has misunderstood
You want me to check if it was paid this month?
Yes, I understand that you requested a cancellation.
Yes, I checked and the member #@name# has already canceled his/her regular payment.
Yes, so you paid three times. There was no deposit this month.
Yes, that is confirmed
This is #@Affiliation# #@Name# working with customers. How can I help you?
Yes, hello, this is #@affiliation#
There is currently a student who is double-distributed.
Are you talking about double distribution?
Yeah, so I'm trying to cancel one allocation.
They said that it can't be distributed because it's learned content.
Is there a reason why you have distributed it repeatedly?
This was distributed, but I think it was distributed again and then redistributed.
Yes, then you are the manager of the Busan center.
No, I'm the general affairs manager.
Mr. General Affairs, what is the number for cancellation of distribution?
The cancellation number is #@number#
Okay, I'll check and get back to you.
Yes, please contact me quickly.
This is #@Affiliation# #@Name# working with customers. How can I help you?
Yes, this is #@affiliation#
One of those guys is having trouble.
I just processed it as a student again, but it keeps saying that I can't register.
Is this when you log in to the learning machine with a four-digit password?
When did you say that registration was not possible? What is your name?
Your name is #@name#
#@Name#, please wait a moment.
Yes please, thank you
By the way, what is the password of the member you pressed?
Wait, password #@number#
#@Number# is it? Then, not the device in question right now.
Could you try logging in from another device?
Other devices don't work either
What exactly does it say on the screen?
I am unable to register as a user, so please contact the teacher.
Please tell me that the user is not registered
I don't think your registration was successful at all.
Well, I'm from the consulting team, so should I connect you to the technical team?
Okay, then please do that.
This is #@Affiliation# #@Name# with our customers.
I'll connect the remote right away and control it.
If you click on the gear icon in the upper right corner, you will see the remote call app.
If you click on that, you will see a six-digit number input window.
What is the latest version of the program?
Yes, there is an update
Yes, should I say yes?
Yes, please press Yes and touch the word Install.
Install and complete here Open

Your number is #@number#. Please check the terms and conditions.
Please check the box next to Agree.
I did the following example, but I can't hear you very well on the phone.
I can't hear you well. I'll call you back later.
Yes, I understand. Thank you.
This is #@Affiliation# #@Name# working with customers. How can I help you?
Yes, hello, I am teacher #@name# from Mapo Sangam branch.
Among my children, there is a child named #@name#
Your member name is #@name#
Yes, the original payment date is the 16th.
I just saw that the payment was not made due to insufficient card balance.
So when I clicked re-pay, it seems like the payment was made.
I was wondering if you could check for me
Has the payment been made? If so, can you give me your membership information?
What should I tell you? Should I tell you my membership number?
Please tell me your membership number.
Your membership number is #@number#
Member #@Name# has been paid as of today's date
Yes, it was paid
Yes, that's right, the payment has been made.
Yes, thank you. Thank you for your hard work.
This is #@Affiliation# #@Name# working with customers. How can I help you?
It's nothing else. I just canceled the distribution of the textbooks that were distributed.
Yes, teacher, I want to cancel the distribution.
Smart #@Affiliation# I cancelled two books out of the minus 48 textbooks in stock.
There are only minus forty-seven volumes.
Are you saying that you cancelled the distribution of two textbooks?
Yes, it was minus 48 volumes before, but if you cancel two volumes
It should be minus forty-six volumes, but it's only forty-seven volumes.
Become the president of Seongju Center
Yes, I am the president of Seongju Center.
Since I am a member of the learning period consulting team, it is difficult for me to give you precise guidance on this matter.
The relevant business team within our customer service center will contact you shortly.
And I think it's necessary to convey the content
Could you please tell me a contact number I can call?
Your number is #@phone#
Yes, I have now cancelled the distribution of two textbooks.
You're saying that the original inventory was minus forty-nine volumes?
No, forty-eight volumes.
Yes, I understand. I will convey the relevant information to you.
I will make a request so that you can make a call.
Yes, I have a favor to ask.
This is #@Affiliation# #@Name# working with customers. How can I help you?
Yes, I'm calling because something is not going well at #@affiliation#.
Are you having trouble with your device while learning?
First, we will check the information of the member who made the inquiry and provide quick guidance.
The name of the child you are studying with is #@Name#, you are the member's mother.
Please tell us the last four digits of your registered mobile phone number for accurate consultation.
Yes the number is #@number#
Yes, thank you for checking the valuable information. It was also on August 13th last year.
The content you discussed came up
That won't work
Then it's the same as before
Yes, I did, but can I go in right away without connecting the pad?
No, you are not connecting.
Then you can say no and go in.
Yes, yes, please.
Then, can I go to #@affiliation#?
I will control it remotely before entering #@affiliation#
Please wait a moment while I connect you to the person in charge.
Okay, I understand. I'll wait.
This is #@Affiliation# #@Name# working with customers. How can I help you?
Yes, I am the director of Namgu, Myeonmok. I just joined today, the last day of the month.
When a child who has enrolled creates an ID and takes classes,
How is the two-day usage fee calculated?
Yes, in the case of new members
Because sometimes, like now, we start studying in the middle or end of the month.
It has been confirmed that in the first month, you will be paid according to the amount you have learned.
Are you talking about daily calculations?
Yes, that's right. If you register now this month and start learning today or tomorrow,
In July, it is confirmed that only those two days are counted.
Then how much is it in daily calculation?
You can divide the 33,800 won and check for two days.
Divide the number of class days by thirty-eight thousand four hundred won. That's how it works.
If you do yes, only two days' worth of study will be counted in the first month.
The following month, it is confirmed that the deposit will be paid monthly.
Then, whether you come in on the 4th or the last day, it's the same.
Everything is calculated on a daily basis.
Yes, that's right, sir.
This is #@Affiliation# #@Name# working with customers. How can I help you?
I lost my textbook.
Yes, I know it was inconvenient, but thank you for contacting us.
Is the person calling your mother?
Yes, your mom is right
Yes, I will check with you and help you.
Please give me your child's name and the last four digits of your phone number.
Your number is #@phone#
Thank you for your words. The member in question lost the textbook by mistake.
Yeah, he said he doesn't know where he left it.
We are currently checking the information on the loss of the member's textbook.
There is no separate registration history. Today, I will check the textbook.
I think I can send it to you, but if this continues
Because we can't send it to you
I would like to ask you to tell your children not to lose it accidentally from now on.
Yes, I understand. I will do that.
Yes, thank you. #@Name#, what is the name of the lost textbook?
Yes #@Product# 10 volumes
Yes, #@Product# 10 volumes have been confirmed
Can you send me the textbook in its original form? #@Affiliation# Did you lose it?
I only lost this textbook
Yes, I will send you the original textbook.
The address is #@address#, please confirm it, but please also give me the detailed address.
The address is #@address#

Yes, I hope you have a nice day. I am #@name#
This is #@Affiliation# #@Name# working with customers. How can I help you?
Yes, when ordering this textbook, you need to order it according to your level.
I heard that now you can order regardless of level for a limited time
Yes, that's right, teacher.
Is that until this month or next month?
Are you talking about the pagan textbook? Which center did you contact?
One main center
I think what you said was about support for the leader level textbooks.
This conditional work is supported until the end of August.
Until the end of August, it doesn't matter what level you are at.
Yes, you can do it regardless of your level.
Yes, I understand. Thank you.
Yes thank you it was #@name#
This is #@Affiliation# #@Name# working with customers. How can I help you?
I'm currently using #@product# and I used it with a cell phone charger.
Could you please try connecting the charger now?
That could be the case, but looking at it now, it's the original charging one.
It's a bit too much. Can I get this repaired?
Yes, AS is possible. Mom, then this is the symptom that is happening.
I will give you the instructions for the AS process, and you said #@Product#
Yes, that's right
#@Product# In the case of models such as this, we use post office delivery service.
You can send it to our manufacturer, but when you send it,
Please write down the symptoms of the learning device in detail and give me your mother's contact information.
And please write down the name of our learner member.
Your contact information and learner name.
Yes, I will send you this part as a text message so that you can refer to it.
Is your contact number #@phone number# correct? Mom.
Yes, #@phone number# is correct
Yes, I will send you the AS method via text message.

Yes, I am counselor #@name#. Have a cool and healthy day.
Yes, thank you. Bye.
Yes, thank you, mother
Hello, this is #@Affiliation# #@Name#. I am calling you because you left your contact information.
Yes, there is a student named #@name# among the members right now.
I'm trying to check if that friend's payment has been made.
Actually, the general affairs manager also asked me a question earlier.
He said that his father would pay for it because his mother was busy.
Yes, that's right.
However, I can confirm that you attempted payment on the 27th.
That card was also suspended and payment could not be made.
Yes, I heard you paid today.
Then I'll check again now, teacher.
Yes, please do it
My mom called and said she paid with a different card today.
But when we checked around 10 AM, it wasn't there.
It probably happened after that
I checked and it appears that you haven't paid yet, sir.
Is that so? Then the payment hasn't been made yet in August.
Yes, your payment has not been processed.
Didn't you even try?
Yes, today I can't check my history at all.
Excuse me, what happens if payment doesn't go through right now?
You can just encourage them to keep paying
I explained this to the general affairs manager earlier.
This member originally had a payment date of twenty-one
Yes, that's right
Then it's been postponed now
If payment is made on July 1st, payment will be made again on August 20th.
Twice, yes I understand, thank you

Yes, in the case of #@affiliation#, there is a set learning period.
The period is forty days from the date of payment.
Then I heard that you can install this in two places?
I understand that it can be used on two devices
Then, you can use it by entering both code numbers.
Yes, that's right, Mom. You can use it like that.
Yes, I understand. Thank you very much.
I am #@Affiliation# #@Name# working with customers. How can I help you?

Yes, that's right. Two people can study with one device.
You can purchase the device on the #@Product# site in the PC version.
Are you having trouble purchasing something right now?
When I make a selection there, the next window doesn't go through.
What is the website address? Mom, are you at the computer right now?
No, not now. I called because I couldn't do it on the weekend.
Is it not possible to do this by phone?
Yes, you cannot purchase by phone. You must log in to your account directly.
Sometimes, the site address may be incorrect and you may not be able to access it.

I won a textbook at an event, but I have it. What should I do with it?
Ah, is this a duplicate of the event textbook?
Yes, if I receive this as an event, can I get a refund or give it to you as something else?
Event materials cannot be refunded, customer.

I bought it quite a while ago and it probably won't work, but I did use it.
Then, it is not possible because there are no textbooks eligible for a refund.
Is it not possible to replace it with another textbook?
Your regulations don't allow that.
Okay, I'll take it first. I'll hang up.
Yes, have a nice day today. This was counselor #@name#.

Coupons cannot be exchanged, customer.
Then you won't exchange it for money?

You just need to use it within the validity period.
You can use it later if you change your mind.
It's just a pet that I have. I understand that it's the rule.
Be careful of Corona and stay healthy. I was counselor #@name#.

Sorry, customer. If you have used it for even one week, a refund is not possible.
I didn't even touch it, but they won't even give me three weeks' worth

Yes, we ship via courier or post.

Yes, the delivery company is on strike, so I want to change to another delivery company.
Yes, #@affiliation# is sending it through Hanjin and CJ Express.
Yes, one from two places
No, you cannot select a separate courier service.
Yes, you can't choose separately.
Are there two places where delivery workers are on strike?
No, it's somewhere else
Yes, Hanjin delivers complete products, and CJ delivers study materials and general books.
Yes, the items being shipped are different. I understand.
Yes, thank you, this was counselor #@name#
This is #@Affiliation# #@Name# with customers. How can I help you?
It's nothing more than the teacher who originally taught our students video lessons.
The time has changed, so I want to do it with the original teacher.
Then, should I tell you that you contacted me about changing your video English instructor?
#@Other#Center's #@Name#Teacher, are you sure? Please also tell me your membership information.
Your name is #@name# and your number is #@phone#
Can I call your teacher?
Yes, you can contact me.
Yes sir, #@phone number# is correct
No, can you give me your number?
#@Phone# Is this the correct number?
Yes, that's the right number.
Okay, then I'll contact your mother.

#@Affiliation# We have contacted those who have signed up with words of gratitude and guidance.
Can I talk to you for a minute?

Ah thank you #@Product# #@Affiliation# Thank you so much for choosing
Excuse me, but did you receive an explanation about learning from the teacher before signing up?

Your home address is Seoul #@address#

This is #@Affiliation# #@Name# with customers. How can I help you?
I want to change the video English time.
Is this the whole month of July or just one day, sir?
Is the whole thing possible? Is it possible to do it later on Thursday?
Are you considering late Thursday? What my mother said
This is something I asked the video English consultation team when I was making a reservation.
What is the name of your child taking video English classes and the mobile phone number you signed up with?
My name is #@name# and my number is #@phone#
Thank you for checking the valuable information. Please note that if you change the schedule,
The native English speaking teacher I used to have is changing to someone else.
Would you like to keep it as is, sir?
Yes, it doesn't matter if it changes.
It doesn't matter if it changes. If you say that from now on, the class will be held late every Thursday.
What time is it roughly, sir?
I'd like to request after nine o'clock.
After nine o'clock, I would prefer Thursday.
Your mother contacted our video English counseling team.
I will help you by accepting your consultation reservation.
Would you be available to talk to me between 3 and 4 today?
Thank you from 3 to 4 o'clock
Confirm that the number you can contact is #@phone number#
I will call you again between 3 and 4 o'clock to help you with your consultation.
This is #@Affiliation# #@Name# with customers. How can I help you?
That number changed, but my mother's number is still the old number.
So I want to change that, but my mom said I have to do it myself.
So even though my mother kept telling me to do it, I was busy and couldn't change it.
You can do it at the center.
Can I do it at the center? Then I will request it at the center.
Yes, then could you tell me some old information?
This number is not searchable, sir.
I also found out that my old number has changed
The old number ends with #@phone number#, teacher.
If we do that, it will be difficult to confirm. Could you tell me your name?
I will search by name
My name is #@name#
#@Name# Member, I will check it out.
Elementary 6th grade #@Address# Are you a resident member? Teacher
I moved house too, does that apply to the center?
All adjustments can be made at the center.
I heard that it wasn't possible back then
It's possible. Then we can give you the teacher's number.
After eleven o'clock, from the video English team
I will pass it on to you so that you can call me directly.
This is #@Affiliation# #@Name# with customers. How can I help you?
Yes #@Affiliation# How are textbooks distributed for the premium member secondary course?
You asked about the middle school course. As you know, the flat-rate system
This is a part where you can learn 24 times for 150,000 won per month.
If the secondary school textbook is 60,000 won or 70,000 won,
Each volume is composed of ten chapters.
It's a 24-hour course for 150,000 won per month.
Then, if you distribute three books a month, you will only have twenty-four out of thirty classes.
I'm taking a class and the remaining 6 hours are carried over to next month.
You can continue taking classes continuously, and the sixth period will be over next month.
The teacher only distributed textbooks for the 18th period, excluding the 6th period.
You can take classes, but that doesn't mean the moon has changed.
Teacher, you don't need to establish the individual again, you can establish the plan from the beginning.
The learning of that textbook will continue.
Okay, so there's nothing else I can do?
Yes, sir, you can continue.
Yes, I understand. Thank you.
This is #@Affiliation# #@Name# with customers. How can I help you?
I've resumed class again, maybe later?
Yes, please tell me
If you want to take this #@affiliation# class again, you can switch to class
When you take the class again, please call us.
We will make a reservation for you in the secondary department.
After I got a call from the department, I went to my home computer.
Connect your device to a regular tablet or mobile phone using a USB cable.
You can reinstall the entire program
Okay, yes, I understand.
Yes, it was #@name#. Have a cool and healthy day.
Yes, thank you. Thank you for your hard work.
This is #@Affiliation# #@Name# working with customers. How can I help you?
I was thinking of quitting after this month, but they said they're releasing a study guide
The teacher is on vacation
Yes, it's because of the study materials for next month.
Other study materials say that this textbook will be released next month.
How many days should I contact you within?
You can tell me before the teacher orders the textbooks for next month.
It's not the end of July yet, so you can tell me later.
Teacher, do you know when your vacation ends?
Well, anyway, I couldn't teach this week, but you're coming next Thursday.
Yes, then I think you can tell me next Thursday, Mom.
But that doesn't mean it's too late
This is #@Affiliation# #@Name# working with customers. How can I help you?
Yes, thank you for your hard work. I am with my son.
I'm going to quit after this month. Is it okay to call for work?
Are you saying you will stop learning? What is your child's name?
My name is #@name# member
Yes, can I get the registered contact information of my mother?
Your number is #@phone#
Are you taking a home visit class once a week?
I'm taking home visit classes once a week.
Mom, so you're stopping your studies now?
First of all, you should talk to your teacher.
The teacher is on vacation right now.
Then, teacher, how long do you plan to teach?
Well, I paid this month's bill, so I'm going to stop here for the rest of the month.
Then, I think you can tell me when your homeroom teacher comes back from vacation.
If it's urgent, I can pass it on to the center.
Yes, please handle it that way.
This is #@Affiliation# #@Name# with customers. How can I help you?
Yes, the child I am currently studying with had some circumstances and had to skip school.
When I try to study again, the teacher says that the schedule is not included in the distribution history.
The person who contacted you just now is the Ulsan Okdong General Affairs Manager.
No, I am the center director.
Yes, Center Director, can you confirm whether the textbook has been distributed?
Is this perhaps a textbook that is 180 days old?
The distribution is currently scheduled for May 2nd. Just a moment.
Yes, please tell me after checking.
#@Other# The distribution of the four rights is scheduled for the 2nd day of May
It's May 2nd. Can you check the member number?
Your number is #@phone#
Is your name #@name#?

Yes, I think I need to check this part and tell you. Please wait a moment.
This is #@Affiliation# #@Name# working with customers. How can I help you?
Hello, this is the #@affiliation# study guide.
Yes, there are study guides and there are also academy and tutoring centers.
From what age can you start learning?
Our teacher visits us once a week for a class
Usually, it starts at age six and continues through high school.
What time is it
If it is a weekly home visit class, please come and teach for about thirty minutes.
Twenty to thirty minutes class. Okay, I understand.
On a separate day, we now teach using tablet PCs.
I teach using a tablet PC, so the learning results are sent to the teacher.
I am teaching under a monitored system.
Yes, thank you for your answer.
Yes, hello. I am a counselor from #@Affiliation# #@Name#
I'm trying to watch your video lectures, but the program isn't installing properly.
Yes, you have registered as a member.
Yes, I signed up and I'm at the PC right now. Can you tell me now?
If you look at my video history on my homepage, you will see the details of your application.

Then, if you look to the right of that column, you will see HTMLO.
Yes, I see something like that in the red box
Then click on it and when the download comes up, click on it.
Yes, just a moment. Oh, it works. The language selection screen appears.
Select your language as Korean and click OK. The installation screen will appear.
Yes I pressed it and it's in progress I get it now
Yes, that's good. You don't have any further questions.
This was counselor #@name#. Have a nice day.
Yes, hello. I am a counselor from #@Affiliation# #@Name#
Yes, it's because I'm writing an online training record.
Yes, can I ask you about writing your test name?
Have you seen the online training record manual on the website?
It's available as a booklet and as a file.
I'm writing this online right now
Yes, I am writing. Please speak.
When you click on Select from the test name, it will appear on the left.
Yes, you are doing well.
But what about the test names that aren't here? Should I just use other?
If you click on the other button, a box will appear where you can write your own text.
I think you can just write it there
Oh, I didn't press it, thank you
Yes thank you counselor #@name#
Yes, nice to meet you. I am a counselor from #@Affiliation# #@Name#
Yes, nice to meet you. I have something to ask you.
Yes, what is your inquiry?
Yes, I'm watching a video lecture, but the progress bar doesn't display properly.
Yes, do you watch it at work?
Sometimes I do it at work, and sometimes I do it at home.
Yes, when we consulted, it seemed like it was because of the security system.
I think the information transmission is blocked due to the internal network.
So, I recommend that you use it in your personal space rather than at work.
Ah, if I do it at home, I won't have time to watch everything.
In that case, I think it would be better to use Chrome rather than Internet Explorer.
Oh, then I guess I'll have to try connecting with Chrome.
Thank you for your guidance
Yes, this is counselor #@name#. Have a nice day.
It's a sunny morning. I'm a counselor from #@Affiliation# and #@Name#.

Hello, I'm listening to the lecture on my mobile phone and it keeps disconnecting.
Yes sir, the video keeps stopping playing on your mobile phone.
Yes, I don't have enough capacity, but I don't know why.
Yes, it can happen due to temporary errors or a lot of concurrent users.
Oh, I'm so frustrated, it's hard to study
If it still doesn't work, you can try reinstalling the app.
Oh, here it tells me to delete the app and reinstall it.
Yes, there are cases where it can be resolved that way.
If that doesn't work, try updating the firmware.
We recommend that you have your phone checked at a mobile phone service center.
Okay, I understand. I need to get it checked out.
Yes, have a nice afternoon, this was counselor #@name#
Hello, I am your friendly counselor #@Affiliation# #@Name#
Yeah I can't find the quiz for each week.
When did you stop seeing the parking lot quiz?
I don't think there was a parking quiz from the beginning.
I had it before when I was taking other classes.
Oh, sir, isn't this a non-refundable course?
It's a subject where the quiz isn't visible.
I think so, but it's non-refundable.
Ah, the non-refundable subject doesn't originally have a quiz for each week.
Oh, that's right. There was originally no such thing as a non-refundable policy.
Yes, sir, you don't have to worry.
Yes, thank you for your guidance.
Have a nice day, kind counselor #@name#
Hello, customer. This is #@Affiliation# #@Name#
I'm trying to install the #@affiliation# app.
Yes, but the app doesn't appear in the Play Store.
Yes, you are saying that the customer app search is not working.
Yes, I haven't been able to install it yet because the app search didn't work.
In that case, the account country setting is not Korea.
Okay, I see. Then what should I do?
Yes, first, try resetting your account country to South Korea.
Set your country and search for apps and see if they are related
Yes, if that doesn't work, please contact the Learning Support Center.

Yeah I don't know why it keeps happening
Yes, dear customer, have you added our Workrun homepage to your favorites?
Yes, it's in my favorites
Yes, it can happen if you are automatically logged in.
Even if you start from a screen where you are not logged in,
Oh, I guess I shouldn't log in
If you are logged in for a long time, the encryption settings will not be recognized.
Oh, I see, that's because it doesn't recognize encryption.
Yes, in that case, try adding favorites again without logging in.
Okay, thanks for the guidance.
Yes, customer, have a nice day. This was counselor #@name#
Hello, customer. This is #@Affiliation# #@Name#

Yes, sir. If that's the case, I'll help you.

Yes, please wait. It's being deleted now.
Yes sir, please take your time.
It's done and I'm logging in now. Oh, it works.
Yes, customer, have a nice day. This was counselor #@name#
Hello, customer. This is #@Affiliation# #@Name#
Yes, I don't see the next button
This may be because the version does not match the video lecture of WorkRun.
Our work run is optimized for Internet version 8.0.
If you have a lower version than this, I think this happens often
I guess it's because the internet version doesn't match
Then do I have to reinstall it?
Yes sir we will email you the free download method
Oh, I see. Then please send it to me by email.
My email address is #@account#
Yes, I just sent it to your email. It contains instructions regarding the version upgrade.

Yes, I attended all the classes, but my progress is not 100%.
You're saying that your progress rate doesn't quite match reality?
Yes, no matter how many times I save it, it doesn't work.
It could be because your computer has accumulated cookies.
Would you like to go into Internet Options?
Wait a minute, internet options
In your options, look for the Delete Internet Browsing History Cache or Cookies button.

Could you please tell me what your symptoms are?
Yes, when I turn it on, a message saying &quot;Video file not found&quot; appears.

Are you saying that it takes a long time to print the certificate?
I'm using the program because I need to print out my official seal.
It takes 30 minutes to print every time. It's inconvenient.
#@Other# It seems like it took a long time to print because it is not compatible yet.
Is there any other solution?
Certificates with omitted seals are also accepted for submission.
I think it would be better to print it out as a certificate of completion with the seal omitted.
Yes, I understand. Please change the program to make it compatible with #@Other#
I will try to reflect your opinion. This was counselor #@name#.
The place you are contacting is #@affiliation# counseling center.

I checked the current lecture videos and they are all playing normally.
Are you having trouble playing a specific lecture?
No, when I tried it earlier, it didn't work
In that case, it seems that the video playback was not smooth due to a large number of connections.
So it's okay now
Yes, it may also be difficult to play depending on your PC environment.
Please use Chrome rather than Internet Explorer.
Okay, I understand, Chrome instead of Explorer.

You don't have to do it, but one person will have to sleep on the floor, so it might be necessary.
I'll take care of sleeping if you just pay the extra person fee.
In that case, you don't have to add bedding.
Okay, I understand. Thank you for your hard work.
Thank you, counselor #@name#

I'm planning to travel to Chungju this week.
Yes, how may I help you?
I'm planning to try exploring the Madangbau section of the Sojo-ryeong Road over Saejae Pass.
I'm curious about the difficulty level of the mountain uphill course.
You know that it's a course that goes from Chungju to Mungyeong through Goesan, right?
Yes, so I heard that there is a level of difficulty from Janggogae to Ijeongpyo.
Yes, that course takes quite a while because it crosses the mountains.
Because it is a mountain path, you can walk relatively more comfortably than on a regular village road.
Oh, so that's why the difficulty levels are marked on the map.
Yes, I think you need to prepare yourself mentally for the Janggogae course.
Thank you, it helped a lot
I am a joy-filled counselor #@name#
Hello, I have a question regarding Janggogae Road in Chungju.
Yes, please feel free to speak.
I heard that Janggogae Road is almost a natural mountain road.
This is a course that requires you to go through a forest path that has hardly been touched by four people.
I wonder if the mountain path is narrow.
It was the road that the envoys took on their way to Japan during the Joseon Dynasty.
It is wide enough for a palanquin to pass through.
Hmm, it's wider than I was worried about.
However, we recommend long pants as the overgrown grass can get caught on your legs.
Yes, thank you. I understand.
Thank you, this was counselor #@name#

Hello, I really want to experience the Jirisan trail during my trip to Namwon.
Yes, how may I help you?
Could you give me a brief explanation of the Jirisan Trail?
Jirisan Dulle-gil is a walking trail that connects three provinces and five cities and counties around Jirisan.
By the way, what is the total length of the perimeter road?
You can think of it as about 300 kilometers in total.
Wow, that's a really long walk.
Yes, through various maintenance projects, we are connecting the old roads and mountain passes in various parts of Jirisan.
It is a path to rediscover, connect, and cherish the meaning of nature, village history, and culture.
Thank you, it helped a lot
Have a nice day, this was counselor #@name#
I will help you enjoy your trip more. #@Name#
Yes, hello, I have a question.
Yes, what is it about?
I want to try the Jirisan trail this time.
It's my first time so it's very vague. Is there a map that shows the course in detail?
A detailed course map is posted on our Namwon Tourism website.
Is it possible to download the map?
Yes, and so that we can give you an indirect experience of the perimeter road.
I have also uploaded a video of the VR experience, so it will be helpful if you check it out in advance.
Yes, I was scared because the course was so long, but I think it will be very helpful.
Have a happy trip, this was counselor #@name#
Yes, I will hang up. Thank you for your hard work.
Hello, this is customer service center #@name# counselor.
This time, I'm planning to visit Jirisan Mountain Trail with my parents during my trip to Namwon.
We're not going to dominate, we're just going to sample it as much as possible.
Oh, can I tell you a section that is easy for your parents to walk?
Yes, I looked it up and it seems like a lot of people recommend the old road section.
Among the old roads, the old road from Naesong to Hoedeok is about 4 kilometers long.
I recommend it because the road is wide and well-maintained.
Is the slope of that section gentle?
Yes, the slope is gentle so parents can enjoy it too.
Thank you, it helped a lot
Have a happy trip, this was counselor #@name#
Yes, I will hang up. Thank you for your hard work.

I'm thinking about taking on the Jirisan trail. How should I prepare?
Yes, the entire trail is made up of farm roads, forest roads, and not tourist trails.
You should plan your walking route and accommodations in advance through the website.
It might be a bit difficult to find convenient facilities.
Yes, so you must prepare lunch box water and snacks.
Then I guess I'll have to take the trash back with me.
Yes, you have to do that. It's a residential area, so there are hardly any public restrooms.
So where should I go if I need to go to the bathroom?
You must use the open restrooms in the terminal or government office accommodation village.
Yes, thank you. I understand.
Thank you, this was counselor #@name#
Hello, this is a counselor from the counseling center #@name#
Yes, hello, I have a question.
Yes, what is it about?
Is it possible to explore the Jirisan trail as a group at a gathering?
We can't tell you that group travel is not possible, though.
It is best to do this with a group of 5 or fewer people, including family and friends.
Oh, is that so? Why is that?
The trail course passes through the villages of local residents.
Group travel can itself be uncomfortable for your living space.
Ah, since you're passing through a village, there might be something like that.
Yes, do you have any further questions?
No, thank you. Thank you for your hard work.
Thank you for your inquiry. This is counselor #@name#.
Yes, hello. I'm planning to visit Jirisan Trail, but I have a question.
Yes, please feel free to speak.
I'm planning to stop by the trail while traveling to Namwon.
If I bring a car, where can I park it?
When visiting Jirisan Trail, we usually recommend public transportation.
Is it convenient to use public transportation instead of a car?
Yes, since it is a walking tour, it is for free walking.
Stop by the Jirisan Trail Information Center to get information and use the restroom.
After hearing your advice, I think it would be better to use public transportation. Thank you.
Have a happy trip, this was counselor #@name#
Thank you for your advice. Thank you for your hard work.
Hello, this is customer service center #@name# counselor.
Yes, hello, I have a question.
Yes, what is it about?
Can I bring a mountain bike on the Jirisan trail?
When you say mountain bike, do you mean MTB?
I was wondering if there was a section where I could ride my bike.
The width of the Jirisan trail is usually wide enough for one or two people to walk.
MTBs are not allowed as they cause damage to the Jirisan Trail.
Then I guess I won't be able to use a wheelchair or a stroller.
Yes, there are many narrow sections with significant elevation changes, making it difficult to pass.
Yes, thank you for checking.
Thank you, this was counselor #@name#
I am a happy counselor #@name#
How many courses is the Jirisan trail divided into?
Yes, it is broadly divided into three courses.

How far is the total distance?
You can think of it as about 14 kilometers.

Nice to meet you. I'm planning to go on the Jirisan 2nd course.
Oh yes please tell me
I know that the 2nd course is the Unbong Inwol section, but how far is the total distance?
The total distance is approximately 9 kilometers.
Then it would usually take about 4 hours.
By the way, what is the length of the 2nd course?
Most of the 2nd course is an embankment road and a forest road.
Then the road will be wide and it will be good for many people to walk together.
Yes, it is a flat road and there is the birthplace of Song Heung-rok, the Hwangsan Battle Monument, nearby.
Yes, thank you. I understand.
Thank you, this was counselor #@name#
Hello, this is a counselor from the counseling center #@name#
Hello, can you tell me more about the Jirisan 2nd course?
Yes, you mean the Unbong Inwol section.
Yes, I'm going to try it during my trip to Namwon this time.
First, start from Nonghyup, pass Seorim Park, and then Vision Village.
This is a course that passes #@Address# and arrives at #@Address#
Does the Jirisan 2nd trail have a good view?
To the right, you can see the northwestern ridge of Jirisan.
It is a popular course because it walks on the Unbong Plateau while looking at the Baekdudaegan Mountain Range on the left.
Thank you, it helped a lot
I'm so glad it helped
Yes, I will hang up. Thank you for your hard work.
Sorry for the late response #@name#
Hello, I have a question about the Jirisan trail section.
Yes, please feel free to speak.
I'm so good at walking around the perimeter
I would like to ask which course is more difficult among courses 1, 2, and 3.
In that case, I recommend the 3rd course, which is our Inwol Geumgye section.
How far is the 3rd course?
The distance is approximately 19 kilometers and it usually takes 8 hours to leave.
If the estimated time is 8 hours, it seems like a perfect course for me.
Yes, it's based on the average person's standards, so I think it will take less time to finish than that.
Okay, I understand. Thank you for your hard work.
Thank you, this was counselor #@name#
Thank you for your inquiry. This is counselor #@name#.
Yes, hello, I have a question.
Yes, how may I help you?
I'm planning to challenge myself to complete the Saejae Pass and Sojo Ridge Trail.
I heard that although it is a one-day course, it is a difficult hike.
Yes, the section going up Janggogae will be the most difficult.
Where can I rest and enjoy the view in the middle of the course?
Yes, first of all, the top of Janggogae is the Janggogae observation point.
The Madangbawi Shelter in the middle of the course is also a recommended observation point.
I think two places to rest would be enough.
Yes, do you have any further questions?
No, thank you. Thank you for your hard work.
It's a sunny morning. This is counselor #@name#
I'm planning to go hiking at Gyemyeongsan Mountain in Chungju this week.

What should I wear when hiking?
First of all, materials that are well ventilated and moisture-wicking are good.
We recommend wearing long sleeves to avoid getting bitten by bugs.
Would sneakers be enough for shoes?
It's best to have sneakers with thick soles.
Actually, hiking boots or trekking shoes are the best
Thank you for the detailed explanation.
Have a happy hike, counselor #@name#
Yes, I will hang up. Thank you for your hard work.

Oh yes please tell me
Could you give me a brief introduction to Skywalk?
The Haneuljae Pass connecting Chungju and Mungyeong is the oldest road crossing Baekdudaegan.
The forest path leading to the Skyjae signpost is a full-fledged trekking trail.
How high is the sky?
It is about 500 meters above sea level and the slope is not steep, so the difficulty level is easy.
Is it worth a try for elementary school children?
Of course, it's average, so you don't have to worry.
Yes, thank you. I understand.
Yes, this was counselor #@name#
Hello, this is customer satisfaction center counselor #@name#
I'm planning to climb Mt. Haneuljae this time.

What is the course terrain like?
There are a lot of big and small stones on the floor.
We recommend thick-soled sneakers or trekking shoes rather than shoes or sandals.
Is it really necessary to wear hiking boots?
Yes, the slope isn't that steep so I think it'll be fine.
It's summer so I'm a little worried about the heat.
There is a valley in the middle, so it is good for resting and there is good shade from the trees.
Thank you for the detailed explanation.
Thank you, this was counselor #@name#
Hello, this is customer service center #@name# counselor.
Hello, I have a question about the Sky Road hiking course.

Yes, the real hiking begins at the three-story stone pagoda starting from Mireukdaewonji.
This is the course from the Skyjae signpost to the summit stone, past the Yeon-a pine tree.
How long will the entire hike take?
You can think of it as a 1 hour and 30 minute course for the average adult.

I'm planning a trip from Seoul to Busan with my child. Are there any good places to visit?
Since you said you're going with a child, I think indoors would be better.
How about Busan Aquarium?
I think it would be good since the child has never been there before.
It has a total floor area of 4,000 pyeong and is comprised of the first floor above ground and the third floor underground.
By the way, where is the location? It would be helpful if you could tell me the address.
This is #@Address#, Haeundae-gu, Busan Metropolitan City

Then I recommend Apec Naru Park
The park looks nice. Can I ride a bike?

Are there any historical places worth visiting around Haeundae?
How about seeing the Haeundae Stone Carvings located in Dongbaekseom Island, Haeundae-gu?
Please explain what Haeundae Stone Carving is.
It is said that Choi Chi-won, a scholar from the late Unified Silla period, carved it after seeing a beautiful scene.
There is such a background. I think it can be reflected in the performance evaluation.
Dongbaek Park also includes the historic site of Choi Chi-won.

How about the Haeundae Sand Festival?
Are you playing on the beach? What kind of festival is it?
This is a festival that showcases sculptures made from an eco-friendly material called sand.
It's completely different from what I thought. I'm curious about the work too.
Please note that it will be held from early June, the off-season before Haeundae Beach opens.

However, you must confirm the name of the person who made the reservation, the contact information of the person who made the reservation, and the reservation number.
Oh, I'm glad you booked it for your children to see while traveling.
I hope you didn't purchase a discount coupon that only applies to you.

In the case of discount coupons that are only applicable to the individual, proxy receipt is not possible.
I'll have to call and check. Thank you.

Changes are only possible through cancellation and re-booking of the reservation.
I thought I just had to change seats, but it was more complicated than I thought.
Yes, please understand. Also, a cancellation fee will be charged.
The seats are too far apart so I was going to change them, but I'll just watch them.

Are you saying that you cancelled your reserved seat by using a ticket for each performance?
Sorry, but your package cannot be cancelled.
I've used it twice, but it seems like it won't run out. What should I do?
If you have already viewed one or more works using a reservation ticket, you cannot do so.
If I had known this, I would have been more careful about my purchase.
This is the part where you are notified of the terms and conditions and are informed when purchasing a customer package.
Okay, I'll just watch it and use it up.

I guess I'll have to take the village bus to see the neighborhood.
It's also a great way to feel the atmosphere of a seaside village.

Hello, I would like to inquire about reservations.
Are you experiencing any inconveniences regarding reservations?
#@Other# I was thinking of selling advance tickets too
My family is going on a trip, so I was thinking of giving them a gift.
Advance tickets are on sale and can be purchased and used online and offline.
Could you please tell me how to buy online?
After you log in to the website
Select movie tickets next to the search bar on the main page.
After clicking on the reservation ticket, select the number of reservation tickets and make payment.
That works, but where can I check my purchase history?
The ticket purchase confirmation page will appear large.
Okay, I guess I'll have to go ahead and make a reservation. Thank you.
I hope you make good memories at #@Guitar#

Hello, I have a question.
Yes, customer, what part are you curious about?
I'm trying to buy a ticket
Are there any differences from regular tickets?
For advance tickets, you can purchase them in sets of 10.
Individual purchases are not possible.
Also, some movies, such as 3D screenings or performance videos, cannot be used.
Is there an expiration date? What is the period of use?
Tickets must be used within 2 years from the date of purchase.
So, what is the refund process? I just wanted to know.
If you use even one piece from a set, you cannot receive a refund.
Also, refunds are only possible within 90 days from the date of purchase.
I see. Good thing you asked. I'll have to keep that in mind.
Any other questions?
Yes, it's resolved. I'll think about it and buy it.

Hello, I would like to inquire about group viewing.
I'm thinking about taking a group tour during my trip, including adults and teenagers.
Have you decided which movie you want to see?
I'm planning to watch an independent film currently showing at a small theater.
For individual group viewing, 70% of the number of seats is charged.
So what is the difference in rates between adults and youth?
For medium and small theaters, individual fees are not calculated.
Fares are charged based on only 70% of the seating capacity
So how much will we have to pay?
In the case of a small theater, 146 seats are 70% of the seats and the price is 1,168,000 won.
I'm looking forward to it because I think I'll be able to watch it for less than I thought.
Do you have any other questions?
No, that's enough. Thank you for your kind guidance.
Please feel free to contact me anytime I am your counselor #@name# Thank you

Hello, I would like to go on a group tour with my youth.
Yes, customer, what part are you curious about?
I'm planning to see a film that is being screened at the Cinematheque. Please tell me the price.
In the case of a special exhibition screening of Cinematheque being held in a medium-sized theater,
Since you are using the entire space, you will be charged 70% of the number of seats.
You don't pay per person.
That's right, so the cost for 70% of the seats, 284 seats, is 1,420,000 won.
I see. Is it possible to only use the movie viewing time when viewing alone?
The use of the space before and after the event is limited to a maximum of 2 hours and requires prior consultation.
Okay, thank you for your kind guidance.
Please contact me anytime #@Affiliation# Thank you
Haeundae Cultural Tourism Landmark #@Affiliation# #@Name#
Hello, can I ask you about the rates?
Yes, customer, what part are you curious about?
How do I get a preferential discount?
First, this is a benefit provided to customers aged 65 or older.
I know that, but I'm curious about how to make a reservation.
When making an online reservation, please select a rate that meets the discount criteria.
You choose your own rate.
Yes, you can. Just bring the supporting documents when you pick up your ticket and enter the theater.
I think it was a good idea to ask since I need the documents.
If you have any other questions, please let me know.
Yes, that's enough. Thank you for your kind guidance.

Hello, I would like to inquire about a reservation.

In the case of seat reservation, it is not linked to the #@affiliation# reservation issuance system.
So, will I know my seat on the day of the screening?
You can specify it when issuing the ticket.
Then I think it would be better to reserve on the #@affiliation# website.

I think I was charged extra for something different from what was stated on the website.
Yes, sir, did you reserve your ticket on the Movie Hall website?
No, I booked through another booking agency.
If you use another reservation agency, the reservation agency's reservation fee will also be calculated.
I think it might be that part
Oh, I didn't think about the fee.
#@Affiliation# If you make a reservation on-site or through the mobile app on the website
Please note that no separate fees are charged.
I'll have to see if I can cancel. Thanks for the info.
Please feel free to contact me anytime I am your counselor #@name# Thank you

Hello, I am planning a trip to Haeundae.
Yes, customer, what part are you curious about?
I was wondering when I can make a reservation to see a performance at the Film Hall.
On-site ticket reservations are available at the Cinema Mountain 1st floor ticket booth on the day of the performance.
I haven't decided on my travel schedule yet, so can I do it online?
Online reservations are available until 5pm the day before the performance date.
The mobile APP is the same
Yes, that's right. You can do it on our website and mobile app.
Okay, I didn't know there was a time limit.
Any other questions?
Yes, that's enough. I'll have to plan my trip by referring to the instructions.

Hello, I would like to ask you a question.
Yes, sir, what are you curious about?
Is it impossible to enter the Film Archive once the movie starts?
Yes, the Film Archive operates differently from multiplex theaters.
We will shorten the promotional videos and trailers and proceed with the screenings according to the screening schedule.
Entry is restricted after the movie starts.
I think it will arrive in about 5 or 10 minutes, so should I cancel it now?
For those who are a little late due to unavoidable circumstances
Entry is only permitted up to 10 minutes after the movie starts.
Okay, then I think I can get in.
Yes, thank you, customer. I hope you enjoy your visit.
Are there any other questions?
Everything is resolved. Thank you for your kind guidance.
Have a happy trip to Busan

I'm a college student and I'm planning a trip on a small budget.
Are there any free movies?
What is your travel schedule, sir?
I'm planning to travel to Haeundae during the last week of this month.
If so, I recommend you visit the Film Archive on Wednesday.
Free screenings are held on the last Wednesday of every month.
That's great. I think it was a really good idea to ask.

Hello, I'm planning to go sightseeing around Haeundae.
I plan to be at BEXCO most of the time during the day.
I was wondering if there was anywhere else to look
Yes, what is your travel schedule?
The schedule is from Friday night to Sunday afternoon.
Most people visit Dongbaek Island a lot.
Is there anything special about Dongbaekseom Island?
There is a walking path with an ocean view and it is a park, so it is different.
Is there anything else besides nature?
The building is beautiful and there is a cloud bridge leading to Haeundae Beach.
If you visit in the evening, you can see the beautiful lights and the night view of Haeundae.
I should see the night view too. Thank you.
Have a nice trip. Thank you.

Hello, I am planning a trip to Busan.
Yes, sir. How may I help you?
I heard that Blue Line Park is famous, so I'm thinking of spending a day there.
Could you please elaborate a bit more?
Are you talking about Haeundae Blue Line Park?
This is an eco-friendly redevelopment of the old Donghae Southern Line railway facilities.
I didn't know it was a railway facility. So the trains run there?
Yes sir, there are two types of trains in operation.
This is a tourist course where you can enjoy the beautiful coastal scenery.
I think it was a good idea to ask about taking the train while looking at the sea.
Is there anything else you would like to know?
No, that's enough. I'll definitely add it to my travel itinerary. Thank you.
Please feel free to contact us anytime regarding your travel and we hope you have a wonderful time creating memories.
