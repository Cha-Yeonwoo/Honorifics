Do you like chicken?
What brand do you like?
I eat everything without being picky, but I like Kyochon!
Kyochon is definitely Honey~
Right?
that's right
Just eat honey combo
It was so delicious
Ah, it's been a while since I've eaten that with rice cakes!
Wow, I admit it
It's really delicious if you eat it like that ㅠ
Since you live with a roommate, ordering a honey combo and two-person rice cakes is perfect!
I know
Should I order it today?
Kiki is totally great
I just ordered ice cream!
ice cream?
It won't be cold today
are you okay
The room is warm so it's hot now!
That's perfect!
It's nice that ice cream is delivered these days.
that's right
But the delivery fee is a bit shocking,
Wow, I admit it ㅠㅠ
Why is the delivery fee so expensive?
that's right,
In some places, it costs 7,000 won.
7000 won?
That's too expensive...
How do you guys clean?
I think we're just people who are visible
Nothing is set in stone
You all have such well-rounded personalities?
that's right
A bit of a rough living style? Haha
Kiki My friend broke up with her friend because of cleaning!
Huh? Are you that angry?
There are people who clean up and people who make a mess!
That's true ㅠㅠ
If that doesn't work out, we can't live together ㅠㅠ
that's right
From my friend's perspective, I thought to myself, &quot;Is this guy scared of me?&quot;
I guess you could feel that way ㅠ
It must have been hard
But the room contract is for one year.
Oh right
Then what did you do?
Kiki said that he posted that he was looking for a roommate, so he found a roommate and kicked out his friend.
Oh, that's a really good idea?
I beat the player!
Kiki, so
That new roommate has decided who will do the cleaning duty!
thank god
I hope you do well this time
Is your house very far from your part-time job?
I don't think it's close
About 20 to 30 minutes?
20 minutes on foot or 20 minutes by car?
I can't go on foot, so I'll take the bus and it'll take about that long.
I see
Bus fare won't be cheap either!
that's right
I get about 40-50 thousand won a month ㅠ
Oh my gosh, how much is the bus fare now?
I think it's around 1500 now
Wow, it got so expensive, a latte used to be 1100 won!
that's right
admit
I think I did that when I was young too
Kiki, did you have a bus card when you were young?
How have you been?
I don't remember very well ㅠ
Latte had something called a token!
What is that?
token?
That's amazing
It's like a bus ticket!
Do you know the bus ticket?
I know the bus ticket
They even give it to you on intercity buses?!
How long have you been working part-time?
I've been working part-time for about 4 months now
Did you sign the contract there?
Okay then
I'm even receiving holiday pay
Do you know that if you work there for a year, you get severance pay even if you work part-time?
Oh really?
Albande, can you give me that?
Even if you work part-time, if you work for more than a year, you get severance pay!
I should ask the boss about it too!
Just type it into Naver and see if the conditions are right for you!
Yeah yeah
thank you
Let me find out
As far as I know, it's going to take more than 15 hours a week!
Then I guess I can get it after a year too lol
yes!
Are you currently deducting the 4 major insurances?
No, it was income tax, they're just deducting that
I see
Well then, let's find out!
okay
okay
thank you
I'll find out
Have you ever been to a friend's visit?
No no
I've never been there! Haha
All of your male friends have been in the military, right?
That's true, but my younger brothers were discharged from the military this time.
Wow, that's really fast.
I guess they all got discharged early because they couldn't go on vacation?
Oh right
It came out much faster than I thought
Kiki is right
They say all the kids will be out in 1 year and 6 months!
no
It feels like I just came in, but I'm already out!
Kiki But they must have been waiting for that day!
Kiki, I guess so
He was always crying ㅠㅠ
Kiki is right
If you look at Instagram, they always post on their stories how many days are left!
that's right
Seriously, why do you keep raising the national rules...
Kiki, they say time doesn't pass when they're there.
Kiki, so that's why you're uploading it
That's too bad
Oh right lol
My cousin uploads that all the time too
A younger friend of mine keeps posting this
Are you studying anything these days?
I'm trying to get my driver's license these days.
You haven't been to school yet?
Oh, I was a little scared, so I just looked into it and didn't register.
Latte's tuition used to be around 500,000 won, but how much is it now?
Wow, it's really cheap
I paid about 800,000 won
Wow, the price went up that much!?
Oh, I heard that getting a driver's license has gotten harder this time.
I got it right before it got difficult!
I wonder if that would be good ㅠㅠ
I waited because I thought I would have less accidents if I followed through when things were difficult
Kiki, whether it's difficult or not, you have to practice a lot and then go out into the real world!
that's right
I think that's the most important thing ㅠㅠ
I also trained hard for a month in my dad's car before taking the exam!
Oh really?
Should I try that too?
But I'm only a first-class student, so you can just do whatever you learn there, right?
Oh, I got it as a really difficult one
What does your mother do?
My mom doesn't work and is a housewife!
I see
My mom got fired because of corona ㅜㅜ
Wow, that's right. There are a lot of people like that these days. It's too much.
There are a lot of people like that these days
It's too much ㅠ
that's right
I'm getting older so it's hard to find a job anywhere else now ㅜ
that's right
My mom originally tried to get a job but gave up ㅠ
that's right
These days, factories are so territorial that not just anyone can go there.
Why are you being so territorial?
It's too much
I think you can think of it as a bit of a league of their own.
Kiki's work is probably messed up too, so please treat new people well.
that's right
If you're even a little slow, they'll say something!
It's my first time, how can I do this well? ㅠㅠ This is really too much
So ㅜㅜ
My mom has been home for over a year now.
My mom is like that too ㅠ
But these days, it's scary because of the coronavirus, so it's better to stay at home!
I admit that Kiki
Like you said, I'd rather stay home!
that's right
I'm less worried now
When was your first relationship?
Your first love was probably in middle school?
You guys were a coed school, right?
We don't have that,
Oh my I was in a co-ed school haha
Are you dating a classmate?
Oh right
I think it's like that because we spend time together
Oh, you were partners with that kid back then?
That wasn't it. We became close as we played together!
Kiki, are you still in touch with her?
no
I cut off all contact haha
Why? Did we break up on bad terms back then?
no
No, I think we just drifted apart naturally
I see
What grade were you in at that time?
I think I was in the second year of middle school
Wow, this is a really good time
There was no such thing as engineering in our area!
Oh really?
There was no engineering at all
So, do you have any plans to keep a pet in the future?
Oh, not yet
And I think it's okay because there are people around me who raise them.
I see
Then, how about raising a pet rock?
Why do people keep pets?
But these days, pet dolls are really popular!
Why on earth is it so popular?
I don't know ㅠㅠ
Kiki says it's lonely living alone, but it's not a good environment to raise animals!
Then, instead of a rock, why don't you just raise it in a cup?
Kiki's pet cup?
That's a bit strange, isn't it?
I think the cup is better
The stone is a bit... ok,
Kiki, wouldn't it be better to have a pet plant rather than a cup?
Wow, that sounds good
Plants sound good!
I'm going to grow cherry tomatoes!
I like the room!
Wow, this looks delicious
But isn't it difficult to raise them?
no
All you need is sunlight and water!
Looks like you're growing up well
Are you good at badminton?
I don't know how to hit it well
Kids are just like that
When you were a student, wasn't there a physical education class where you had to play badminton as a practical test?
Ah, but I didn't try that hard ㅠㅠ
Kiki I got an A on the practical test!
wow
You must be good at badminton!
This is more about teamwork with your opponent than just hitting well!
Ah, I guess going back and forth is important!
Yeah Kiki
If you go back and forth 30 times, it's A!
Wow, that test is so difficult.
You have to hit the ball as high and far as possible!
This is a really good tip.
My friend keeps telling me to play badminton these days.
Kiki It's a little cold right now so it's difficult, but when you let me out, hit me!
I should play badminton later too haha
Kiki, I should ask my badminton sister to play with me after a long time!
Yeah yeah
Let's exercise together!
What game did you play today?
I played Kart Rider today haha
Did you do it with your friend Kiki?
Oh yeah right
I played with a friend and I kept winning
Oh, you did it with the item display?
Of course it is
I made it all happen
Kiki's waterfly is a really annoying item!
that's right
I kept throwing flies at my friend Kiki
That item that makes you do the opposite of the action key is also annoying!
Oh, a devil item?
That really annoys me too ㅠ
Kiki is right
I love playing with that ai!
You know what?
Okay then
People are so good at it, I should do it too lol
Yeah Kiki
Is that what you call a battle challenger?
I don't really know the name ㅠㅠ
Wouldn't that be right?
Excluding me, all 7 users are AI!
It's so good?
I think I can win it all
Kiki, there's an AI that's destroying our team.
That's the most annoying thing!
Oh my god, what is that?
There's something annoying
Have you been knitting recently?
Uh, I couldn't go anywhere so I stayed at a pension and played.
I see
Which area did you go to play?
I went to nearby Daebudo or Gapyeong to play.
Isn't Gapyeong famous for its ppaja?
Oh right
But I was afraid of water so I just stayed in my room.
Oh, right, Kiki
Was the pension a duplex?
Or a regular pension?
I went to a single-family home instead of a duplex, but it was two stories.
Wow, who did you go with then?
I went with my friends and ate delicious food haha
Kiki and daebak
Isn't it really expensive if you live alone?
Oh, that's true, but I went to the cheapest place possible!
If it's a single-family home, there must be a private pool, right?
Oh, right!
So it was comfortable because we could play together
I guess so
I want to play like that with my friends too!
Sister, you should go later too
It was really good!
Do you go to places like ski resorts in the winter?
I'm going to go, but I don't think I'm good at skiing.
really?
Aren't they going to train you there?
It's not like it's worth it to do that, so just let the kids know
When was the last time you went?
Did you go last year?
Oh right
I went last year and went snowboarding for the first time.
I went there for the first time last year too
Did you go to Yongin?
Oh, where was it?
Was it Gonjiam, not Yongin?
Gonjiam?
Is it close to Suwon and Gonjiam?
no
There was a shuttle bus at that time, so I went there.
oh my god
How many hours does it take from Suwon to Gonjiam?
It will take about an hour or two.
Oh really?
But can you stand the cold well?
no
I catch the cold really easily ㅠㅠ
So if you go to the ski resort, come back quickly
Kiki oh kiki
I came back with a cold after going skiing last time.
Wow, I think I'll catch a cold if I go too
This time, an old man found a credit card and used it!
that's right
I saw that
But it wasn't on purpose... ㅜㅜ
that's right
I heard that he had some dementia.
therefore
So there were some people who showed leniency
that's right
This time, my grandmother had dementia? She had something like that, she would pick up things that fell on the ground while walking around, so she happened to pick them up and just use them.
that's right
So ㅠㅠ
It's really a shame ㅠ
Yeah ㅜㅜ
But he said that he couldn't speak properly because he was worried that his children would worry about him while he was on his way to the police station.
In the meantime, you are so kind ㅠㅠ
You must have been out of your mind ㅠㅠ
that's right
But anyway, since you used it without permission, they sent you to the prosecution with an indictment by Hoeryong.
I hope you will take good care of the situation after seeing it. ㅠㅠ
that's right
They said they would show leniency to one of the two victims!
I'm so gladㅠ
What about the other one?
But another person demanded a settlement amount of several million won, saying that he suffered a loss in business due to being investigated by the police.
Oh, that must have been hard for him too ㅠㅠ
I can't help it
Yeah ㅜㅜ
So, the main character of this article, who is the grandmother's son, settled for 2.3 million won!
Still, it's a good thing I didn't use it that much!
Wow, there's an article saying that China launched a missile this time!
Oh really?
Why was the missile launched?
Now they are continuing to develop nuclear weapons!
It's really scary
Are you trying to start a war? ㅠㅠ
This kid doesn't have good relations with Taiwan and Australia either!
I know
Why are there so many countries that China doesn't have good relations with?
That's what I'm saying,
This missile is a hypersonic missile, so it's incredibly fast!
It's not even on radar!
Wow, so if I shoot, I'll just get bombed?
that's right
The US is criticizing China a lot right now!
Since this article appeared in our country, will Korea also criticize China?
We don't have nuclear weapons now, but neighboring countries are making scary things, so of course it can't be helped!
therefore
I think our country also needs some kind of countermeasure ㅠ
Yeah ㅜㅜ
But since we declared that we will not make nuclear weapons, the US should take action!
I know
I hope the US will keep a close watch
Kiki, I think this is a really big international problem!
that's right
I wish our country would also recognize the problem
What foam cleanser do you use?
I use Missha's foam cleansing product
Misha?
Does Missha come in large quantities?
Oh right
So I just bought it
Kiki I bought two Polkls from Olyoung and I'm sharing them!
Oh, I like Olive Young because they have a variety of good things.
Yeah Kiki
In the morning, I use sesame oil, and in the evening, I use charcoal!
Oh like that
You can use them separately
Oh, if I only use charcoal in the morning, my face gets really tight!
Ah, I should try that too
Kiki is right
Oh Seong-cho, do you know about acid foam cleansing?
That's it!
no
What kind of foam cleansing is that?
This doesn't contain a lot of surfactant ingredients, so it doesn't make your face feel tight!
Oh, is this the weak acid?
I see
Yeah, that's right!
Instead, I feel like the cleansing power is a bit weak!
Then it would be perfect for everyday use!
I got injured at work the day before yesterday and I'm out of work!
Wow, you must have had a hard time.
no
I got cut while pouring a drink!
Oh what is it Kiki
Was it like that?
Are you hurt badly?
Kiki but it hurts a lot
I type a lot and I cut my finger!
Wow, that'll be hard ㅠ
And it actually hurts more to get a little cut
that's right
You know what's harder?
Yeah? What's so hard?
When water touches my fingers, it really hurts,
Oh right
When water touches the wound, it really hurts
Yeah ㅜㅜ
I think it's because the wound opened up after being exposed to water!
So I think it's a good idea to put on a waterproof band these days.
Yeah Kiki
But the company didn't have such supplies!
The company is going too far, they don't even have that kind of equipment ㅠ
Kiki, that's right!
I'm so angry!
Ask them to order the supplies later!
Have you ever bought anything from a home shopping channel?
no
I don't watch TV much, so I haven't bought anything from home shopping.
I see
Does your mother use home shopping a lot?
Oh right
My mom is a home shopping fanatic
Kiki, my mom bought fall clothes too this time!
Oh really?
We keep buying necessities
Kiki, what kind of daily necessities do you usually buy?
I usually buy things like toilet paper the most.
Do they even sell toilet paper on home shopping channels?
amazing!
Then, when they are sold on home shopping channels, they are cheap so buy a lot at once.
Kiki, I see
But don't you have to buy at least a thousand rolls?
Oh, I see
I think I'll buy that much
Does Kiki have a place to put it at home?
I'm also separate, so I share it with others.
Kiki, is your room a storage unit right now?
Kiki, put the toilet paper aside!
Have you ever seen a musical or anything before?
Oh, I've only seen it once!
Oh really?
What musical did you see?
The musical I saw at that time was called Yeontan-gil.
Which musical actor appeared?
I don't remember that one because I don't know the famous musical actor.
Celebrities we know also appear in musicals!
From what I saw, there were no celebrities!
I see
I saw the musical that Ok Joo-hyun did!
Wow this looks really fun
I watched it on YouTube ㅠ
that's right
Do you know the song Rebecca?
I actually heard that!
I'm really jealous ㅠㅠ
I also want to go see it later if possible ㅠ
But the cost of the musical was absolutely terrifying!
that's right
Musicals are really expensive ㅠㅠ
Kiki, I gave you 200,000 won!
Wow, I really need to go see the musical
Have you ever seen a movie alone?
Yeah, I like watching movies alone.
Oh really?
What was the most fun movie you've ever seen?
Oh, of all the ones I watched alone, Spiderman was the most fun
Spiderman?
Did that come out this year?
It didn't come out this year, I think it was last year
right?
Isn't this Spiderman season 3?
Oh, I don't know because the name isn't written as the season number ㅠㅠ
I see
Did you know that the Spider-Man leads are actually dating?
Oh, so
It seemed like you were dating someone else!
Kiki so funny Kiki
I love seeing actors dating in real life!
Oh right
I also think that kind of thing is really more fun
Yeah Kiki
I recently saw Mogadishu by myself!
Wow, what about Mogadishu
Is it fun?
That actually happened.
So the story was solid!
Wow, I have to go see it this time too!
Does your sister like sweet food?
Yeah, I really like chocolate and stuff like that!
Oh, I just ate some chocolate chips!
Kiki Oh, that must have been delicious ㅠㅠ
Where did you buy that?
Kiki: Yesterday my boyfriend bought me something similar to that Natto Pop!
Oh, but you have a good lover Kiki, you bought that too
Kiki Ah, you have a habit of buying things when you drink alcohol Kiki
Ahhh...
My dad is like that too, he looks so much like Kiki!
Kiki Oh
That's why Tjuna and Papa are open until after midnight.
Oh no
Doesn't it close at 11?
no
After 12 o'clock, I'm going to attack people like my sister's father and Kiki
It's not Kiki
I haven't seen anyone do that lately ㅠㅠ
Kiki, really?
Is it because of the coronavirus these days?
no
But I don't think it was like that even before Corona ㅠㅠ
Oh really?
No
It was always on when I drank!
Kiki, you must have gotten drunk early and gone home early
Is the house your sister lives in now a house?
Yeah, our house is a house now!
Sister, is that the house you lived in when you were little?
No no
We moved in the middle!
Oh really?
Where are you now? ;
I went right next to it now, but it's the same house Kiki
What the heck Kiki
Sister, you can't get out of there!
Yeah, I started doing business here so I ended up living here ㅠㅠ
But is the place you live the best?
Yeah, then staying at home is the most comfortable thing!
that's right
I'm in Seoul now
I want to go down to the countryside quickly ㅜ
Living in Seoul isn't that great, is it?
As expected, the countryside is the best, Kiki
Yeah ㅜㅜ
I came back alive today, barely surviving in a bean sprout pot.
I really like this place because it's great for driving and it's so relaxing!
Yeah ㅜㅜ
You can't bring a car here!
Yeah, that's why you abandoned the car and went to Seoul...
cheer up...
Sister, is there a car you want to change other than the one you have now?
no
I'm not that greedy right now!
This is new too~
Oh right Kiki
Sister, do you like small cars?
No no
I think something that is neither too small nor too big is good Kiki
I personally want to ride a Niro!
Oh, you?
Are you talking about the car from Kia?
Yeah, that's right
Do you know what that looks like?
I saw it in a picture Kiki
Kiki I actually saw and rode it and it was great!
Oh, the ride wasn't bad, was it? Kiki
Sob sob
First of all, it's better than my car Kiki
that's right
Anything right now would be better than ours Kiki
Kiki, oh right,
We changed our Starcar battery yesterday too.
Wow, battery...
He's also nearing the end of his life ㅠㅠ
that's right,
But I think it's because my sister didn't close the door properly!
Then I guess I'll have to give my sister a scolding!
Sister, have you ever worked anywhere else besides your current job?
no
I've never done a big part-time job
you?
Oh really?
I did it recently!
Oh, what have you tried?
Was it okay?
I'll try working at a karaoke bar for now!
karaoke?
How old were you when you worked at a karaoke bar, Kiki?
Kiki, there's that coin karaoke!
Do you know, sister?
Oh, right
I think you went to the coin karaoke, Kiki
Kiki is right,
I worked from 10 to 2
that's right...
You even broke the dart game...
Aah,
It's not me, it's my sister.
Kiki: But it went well because the boss let it pass at that time!
Kiki right
The dart company fixed it for free ㅜ
You have to be nice to that boss...
Thank you Kiki
Yeah ㅜㅜ
And in the end, I was worried again ㅜ
Oh my god, what did you break again, Kiki?
Sister, have you ever been to a place called Barracks Camp?
no
I've never heard that word before, Kiki
Kiki is right
It's a place that no longer exists,
Shouldn't I know that when I was young?
Kiki is right
Oh, but you don't know?
Yeah... I don't know about that ㅠ
Where the hell are you from...
I'm a country boy,
Wow, just thinking about it still makes me angry,
You must have had a hard time there...
How did you do that...
no
We're elementary school students
But you keep swearing?
Wasn't that a bit harsh on the person in charge there?
that's right
It was just a place run by people who didn't know anything!
Oh, I guess it wasn't a well-organized place? ㅠㅠ
that's right
Well, all the teaching assistants are just college students.
Ah, then those people must have been immature too ㅠㅠ
Phew, but I heard they're going again when I start high school Kiki
I also went to a retreat like that when I was in high school ㅠㅠ
Sister, don't you want to study cooking?
Yeah I'm doing fine with the restaurant right now haha
Then, Kiki, is she turning on the wok?
Dad does that and I serve and deliver!
Don't you want to do it when you see Kiki's dad turning the wok?
no
It was so hard for me ㅠㅠ I didn't want to learn...
Oh, I admit it,
I've been to a buffet restaurant too.
That's really hard ㅜ
that's right
The restaurant is really hard ㅠㅠ I'm tired ㅠㅠ
that's right
The food service industry is a really tough job ㅜ
That's why I ran away haha
Do you not regret running away now?
I have no regrets at all
There was nothing to learn there Kiki
But you met your lover there~
Kiki ahh
The guy who cleaned my trash can~
Hey, give me your trash can~ I'll clean it up for you.
Kiki Oh, I'm so touched~
I'll go and clean up your trash bin later~
Oh good good
Does that mean you're coming to eat?
What did your sister say about your brother?
I have a younger brother! Kiki
How old did you say your younger brother was?
Kiki, you're 6 years younger than me~
Oooooh~ You must have gone to the army~ AmiAmi~
Kiki hasn't gone yet
I'm just a college student!
Oh, I see. Where do you go to college now?
He's going somewhere right now Kiki doesn't care haha
You guys are really real siblings. What about your sister? Kiki
Kiki, it seems like you do everything except fight and hit each other
Kiki, that's right, the house I know got into a huge fight and ended up in the hospital Kiki
Kiki, wow, are there brothers who fight like that?
Yeah, when I was little, I got carried away and got beaten up by my dad. Kiki
Well then, that's something you deserve to get beat up by your dad, Kiki
Kiki, we haven't fought much since then lol
Kiki's dad made things right, Kiki
Sister, where did you meet your current boyfriend?
We went to elementary school together, Kiki
Wow, awesome
Have you been dating since then?
no
We met when we were young, broke up, and met again as adults Kiki
Wow, one of my friends is dating an elementary school classmate!
Oh, you've been seeing each other since elementary school?
No no
They met at a class reunion?
Ah, we met when we had a gathering as adults, Kiki.
Yeah, yeah
I had a really boring reunion, but then I realized that maybe this is how you can become a couple!
Wow I went to a class reunion and it wasn't fun so I came home Kiki
I came home after eating only Kiki chicken Kiki
Yeah, even if it's not fun, chicken is still delicious Kiki
Kiki I met you at Pizza Nara Chicken Princess
Kiki Oh there the pizza and chicken are secretly good Kiki
Kiki, right?
I came back after eating it deliciously ^^
Speaking of chicken, I want to eat chicken ㅠㅠ
Sister, can't you raise a puppy in your yard?
Yeah, I can raise it, but I don't think I can manage it ㅠㅠ
I admit it Kiki
We have cats outside
I also see a lot of cats wandering around the street Kiki
I have three cats at home and they are so cute~
Stray cat?
Are you feeding all three of them?
Oh my, I give it to you twice a day
Kiki, if you do that, you'll end up like a pig and won't be able to climb over the wall, right?
Kiki, no, I grew up outside so I knew how to exercise and go out on my own.
So you're maintaining a slim figure without gaining weight? Kiki
Yeah, but I got the kids neutered so their belly fat increased a bit Kiki
Ah, if you neuter them, they'll start gaining weight...
that's right
The pouch is so fluttery and cute, I could die~
It's so soft and fluffy that it'll be nice to touch, Kiki
Hey, our Obok is like that
So on the back of my hand there is a scar of glory,
Wow...
Cats don't like that though ㅠㅠ
The owner is sick ㅠㅠ
Sister, did you do home training today?
Yeah I'm lying down right now doing homework Kiki
Wow, you're doing it consistently, sis?
Wow~
Yeah, I'll keep trying for a year!
Shhh
I wrote,
I'll quit the gym later,
no
You look great right now too, what are you doing ㅠㅠ
no
I have a lot of hidden fat!
That's all cuteness
It's okay, it's okay!
Kiki, that's right, that's right~
I can never wear a bikini~
Kiki no
There are so many great swimsuits out there these days!
Kiki I should wear that swimsuit skirt!
Oh, that's cute and pretty too, isn't it?
Right
It's been a really long time since I've been to the pool ㅜ
It's hard to even go to the swimming pool these days ㅠㅠ
Yeah ㅜㅜ
It's so heartbreaking ㅜㅜ
I want to go to the swimming pool!
I want to soak in the bathtub ㅠㅠ
Sister, do you know about Liar Game?
Liar?
That's something my friend's favorite singers made, Kiki
Kiki, really?
By any chance, Super Junior~?
Yeah Kiki
Kiki, the friend you know
Kiki Mister Simple~ Men who look good in black suits~
Kiki is right
Were you also sold to by my friend?...
Kiki Of course~
If you go to karaoke, you must sing a medley~
Then Kiki said that if you don't sing at the karaoke, your friend will be mad
Ah, I admit it Kiki
I have to sing until I vomit blood~
But if you go, you guys will be no joke either Kiki
Kiki Of course
Take off your shoes, take off your panties, and scream~
There are always kids who take off Kiki's shoes at least once. Kiki
Kiki right away
You have to hold the tambourine and shake it~
Then shake the buttocks a little too~
Oh yeah
of course
You have to shake the bread dough~
There's even a special game to play at that karaoke room~
Kiki, a game exclusively for karaoke
I guess we'll bet on points...
Sister, have you ever been on a family trip abroad?
no
We don't have any yet ㅠㅠ
I see
Me too ㅜㅜ
This time, I was originally planning to travel to Japan with my family.
Oh really?
But now I can't go anywhere ㅠㅠ
that's right
I haven't even gotten the vaccine so please don't send me ㅜ
Do I still have to quarantine for two weeks if I go abroad?
yes
You have to think about all that before you go out~
Oh my, that's only possible for people with a lot of time ㅠㅠ
Kiki, I have a lot of time and money, but for now, it doesn't apply to me~
I have no time and no money~
Dirt ㅜㅜ If you go, where do you want to go?
I want to go somewhere with my family Kiki
Oh really?
But you couldn't close the door so you never went there?
Well, when I'm resting while working, it's better to just rest ㅠㅠ
Then my sister recommends going to the Maldives with your family and having a mojito
I should go to Mojito and have a glass of Maldives Kiki
It's raining here, how's Nonsan?
Nonsan is very hot and sweaty.
Wow, really?
thank god
The cabbage in our house must grow well~
Did you plant cabbage at home just now? Kiki
I planted cabbage last month~
Does that lose its flavor when it rains?
Sob sob
That cabbage is falling off
Oh, then the cabbage won't taste good. ㅠㅠ
are you okay
Don't come here!
Kiki cabbage needs the right amount of water and sunlight to become a sweet cabbage!
Then I guess I'll have to spray water here myself, Kiki
Kiki right
Can you come to my house and sprinkle it on me?
Do you know that labor costs are expensive?
How much will you give Kiki
Kiki, how much is it?
How much does it cost?
I'll go and spray water for 200,000 won Kiki
possible?
I'll just go down to Nonsan, spray it, and then come back up to Seoul.
Kiki is right
That might be wise
I can't do it ㅠㅠ
Kiki, that springer? The circular? You know that?
Yeah, you mean the one that automatically sprays water? Kiki
Have you seen the recent case where a real estate agent in her 50s was murdered?
Murder?
Why did you sell it by fraud?
no
A stranger killed him with a knife!
Huh, why?
Just for no reason?
no
There is a reason
Should I tell you what it is?
Yeah, what is it? ㅠㅠ
There must be a reason...
The person who killed the woman this suspect loved, the PJ family,
Huh? What are you talking about? ㅠㅠ
The family of the girl you liked?
Yeah, that's right
This suspect liked a female BJ, and he stalked her and blacklisted her.
So the suspect who had a grudge against him found out the identity of the person and killed the Vijay family. It turned out to be this real estate agent.
Wow, I can't have a girl I like, but my family?
You should have reported it to the police right away, not Black.
But these days, you don't go to jail for stalking, you just have to be careful.
Oh really
That won't do ㅠ
A bigger crime is happening...
But until something like this happens, it's all just cotton wool ㅜ
We really need to change our country's laws too ㅠㅠ
that's right
No, what is this?
I think that girl's BJ shock is no joke
therefore
I think I must have really lost my mental health ㅠㅠ
Jansen will also get a booster shot now.
There's been a lot of talk about booster shots these days.
What is that?
It's called a booster shot, which means you get another injection!
Oh, you mean going all the way to the third round?
Jansen, do you know how many times you got hit?
Huh, isn't number 3 the end?
no
Jansen gets hit once and it's over Kiki
Oh, but does that mean it goes to the second round?
Yeah, but do you know where Jansen was made?
What country made that?
Chinese Kiki
Jansen, you're the brother I know, Kiki
Oh, then I guess I'll have to go back and get a second shot?
But the second one is optional!
I don't think it will fit
But I'm still anxious, so shouldn't I get hit more? ㅠㅠ
But I don't think I'll ever get hit again after suffering for a week. Kiki
Oh, that must hurt a lot, Kiki.
Sister, what style of clothes do you like the most?
I like things that are pretty and plain, Kiki
Then, does your sister like one-piece dresses?
That's good too, just something neat and pretty
Haha so feminine!
Then, since it's fall, you should wear a trench coat~
But it's too hot during the day so I'm hesitant to wear it ㅠㅠ
Oh, I admit it
Today I brought my denim jacket with me and came Kiki
that's right
Kiki is a load of luggage
I can't wear it ㅠㅠ
Dirt ㅜㅜ I'm so sad
I had a sweaty stomach today ㅜ
Wow, it must have smelled really bad there!
Kiki, I was crouching down because I was afraid I'd get caught~
You weren't wearing gray, were you?
Kiki, luckily it was black long sleeves~
Well then that's good
Anything but gray is fine Kiki
Kiki admits
If I were gray, I would have been a water-drenched elephant
Kiki, you should go straight to the store and buy some clothes.
How is your parents' health these days?
My parents are still healthy haha
thank god
My dad was diagnosed with high blood pressure.
Oh my, if I get diagnosed, I have to keep taking my blood pressure medication, right? ㅠㅠ
that's right
Now I can't get more insurance even if I want to
Oh, so you're not even letting me get insurance?
This is too much ㅠㅠ
The insurance company loses more if it finds someone sick.
Why is insurance insurance?
I think it's really too much ㅡㅡ
Real Kiki
And my mom doesn't have any fungi
Oh well, now I have to take care of my parents' health too ㅠㅠ
that's right
So my mom got a shot this time
You take a look every now and then and take care of it!
Yeah, I understand ㅜㅜ
My dad will have to take medicine for the rest of his life now.
Oh my...
I'm really worried ㅠㅠ
I don't know,
There are only sick people in my house,
no
I'm just trying to avoid getting a big bottle, so don't worry too much ㅠㅠ
Sister, do you know that there's a slightly superstitious item called a dream catcher?
That was popular back in the day and sold a lot, right Kiki?
Kiki is right
I bought this at Ideas!
I think a lot of people buy that these days when doing interior design!
Oh right
That's why I bought one!
Did you buy it to decorate your room too?
Whew, I'm going to hang it in front of my door!
Oh, so you'll have good dreams now?
But since it's handmade, it takes two weeks Kiki
It takes some time there
Overseas shipping Kiki
Kiki's overseas shipping
Each piece is made by the hands of a craftsman.
But I think I bought it because it was made with sincerity Kiki
Kiki is right
I asked for it to be white
The feather color is also white
I should have made it black, it would have been cool Kiki
Kiki Hmm I bought it from Ideas, should I ask the author?
Yeah yeah
Say you want to compare white and black, Kiki.
Sister, did you see the movie that was released as a Chuseok special this time?
no
I go out and play all the time Kiki
Kiki real true~
I saw the movie with it this time and it was fun
Oh, what were you doing? Kiki
That movie where Han Ji-min appears as an ordinary housewife in a groundbreaking way!
Oh, I think I know what it is
I feel like I've seen a poster, Kiki
Kiki Oh right
I saw that, Han Ji-min's acting is really great.
that's right
She's pretty, she's good at acting, and she has no shortcomings ㅠㅠ
Wow, I'm pretty, but how do I act like this? I really did it with acting.
that's right
He's good at various acting challenges and seems to have a good personality!
that's right
There's a rumor going around that he has a really good personality!
Yeah, I guess that's why everyone likes it!
Yeah, yeah
I hope she comes out as a really lovely female lead this time.
Yeah, I wish Loco would film something like this too!
Oh, I admit it!
Who would be a good partner?
Um, Jo In-seong?
You're so visual-wise the best ㅠㅠ
Heart pounding
Sister, do you watch YouTube or something after work?
Yeah I watch it often because I want to do home training haha
Kiki Oh, who did you say you were looking at back then?
I just see it as an algorithmic world haha
Kiki me too Kiki
I watched National Geographic yesterday and saw a turtle laying eggs.
Huh? Do you upload videos of that there? Kiki
Kiki, in the comments there, it says something about YouTube's unknown algorithm?
That's so funny Kiki
Have you ever enjoyed nature's mysteries?
Kiki no
I was watching the dance at that time, and then it went to the next scene?
Kiki, what on earth does that have to do with dancing?
Kiki, so
Funny Kiki
Then it moves on to some movie review
I guess it's because I just watch everything Kiki
Is that so?
Kiki said, &quot;What the heck is this?&quot;
Kiki, sometimes you get caught up in weird stuff, okay? Kiki,
Kiki dog laugh
What kind of algorithm awaits me today?
Today, I'm going to watch Zara lay eggs~
I'm so hungry right now,
Oh my, you didn't even eat lunch?
Four o'clock
Lunch just arrived,
Kiki, what are you eating?
Eating late
Kiki, have you tried the nakgopsae!?
Oh no no I don't eat tripe Kiki
Oh my gosh, no one I know eats octopus or shrimp.
Kiki, you don't eat seafood, but shrimp is delicious.
Kiki That's right, that guy only eats tripe Kiki
Oh my, if you meet me and eat together, it's fantastic
Kiki: So it's a fantastic combination, right? Do you agree?
Oh, is it tasty?
Acorn?
Octopus, Gopchang, and Shrimp
I don't know, this is my first time trying this too!
Kiki Oh my gosh ~ Is that a delicious restaurant?
The reviews are good, but I didn't know this was a joke? Kiki
Ah, Kiki, you have to boil it in the microwave. Do you have any sari?
Do you sleep with Fatty in your room?
No, Tungi likes his mom so I sleep alone in my room.
Wow, our Obongi loves his mom the most too!
Kiki, animals are like mommy's gummies~!
Moms give us a lot to eat~
Yeah my mom always gives me meat and rice and then gives me rice ㅡㅡ
Kiki, you like people the best, people who buy you delicious food!
Oh, that's true!
I take him for a walk every day
Kiki Aah, Tuntun likes to eat the most!
That's right, meat is better than walking, my prince
Kiki Then you sleep alone in your room
Yeah I sleep alone with the pillow mister
What is Kiki Follow Mist?
Is it a doll?
If you spray it on your bedding before going to bed, you will fall into a deep sleep with the scent of Kiki.
Oh, isn't that called aromatherapy?
Oh, that's right. I like the aroma of lavender mixed with rose.
You said you take the company bus, right?
Hey, the commuter bus comes every day
Is that welfare?
Can I not pay?
Yeah the commuter bus is free, totally awesome
Kiki But once you leave, you can never get on again, right?
Kiki, that's right, I feel like I'll get kicked out if I ride it, the knight's face is so familiar,
Do you take the commuter bus when you come home?
Yeah, if I miss it, I'll have to take the 8 o'clock commuter bus Dam Kiki
Kiki Hey, what's the interval between commuter buses?
It's only once, if you miss it it's over
Kiki, oh my, Kiki, are you coming at 6?
Hey, once at 5:30, and once at 8 for overtime. If I miss it, I'll have to sleep at the company.
I see. So you'll definitely take the 5:30 train?
Yeah, that's why I always get off work on time every 20 minutes.
Kiki, I guess I should do that. It would be nice not to have to worry about what others think!
Kiki, that's right, people also take commuter cars, so they send them off early.
Where did you work at a convenience store?
I've been to both Nonsan and Sejong.
Wow, you guys have been to all these places?
I only saw See You twice ㅜㅜ I have a connection with See You,
Kiki, how many hours did you work that time?
Nonsan about 5 hours on weekdays?
Sejong 7 hours on weekends
Oh, I see! What was the minimum wage back then?
Oh, when I was in Nonsan, it was around 5,000 won, and when I was in Sejong, it was around 7,000 won.
Oh, Sejong gave a little more?
Oh, oh, Kiki, back then it was just legal
Kiki, I see. It's almost 9 thousand won now?
Oh right, isn't it in the late 8,000 won range? ㅜㅜ It's totally awesome
That's right, there's a rumor that it will be raised to ten thousand won next year.
Oh really?
My arms and legs are shaking wondering how much the prices will rise.
Kiki's suffering is the share of the self-employed and citizens,
Isn't this just inflation?
Do you know how military officers select drivers?
Oh my, how are you?
Driver's license pouch
Well, that's an option, here are the specs!
Huh specs?!
Height and looks?
Or academic background?
Well, it seems like all that stuff is included implicitly!
Kiki Hull, why the driver!
Isn't it enough to just drive well?
Because the higher the executive, the more external events he attends!
Oh, wow, I see. It has to suit the tastes of high-ranking officials.
Have you ever seen a Tustar driver? That's awesome.
why?
Are you handsome?
Are you a graduate of Seoul National University?
Are you Jea's **?
Do you know that idol?
Yeah, you know, that handsome guy?
Hey, you're exactly like that guy!
Wow, awesome Kiki, how is that person a driver?
That kind of person would be a driver, lol
Kiki Hagin, if you're a Tustar driver, oh my, that would be great
Don't you want to study a foreign language these days?
Ah~ I want to try speaking English~
I think English conversation is essential for me too.
So these days, even elementary school students are learning English conversation ㅜㅜ
Hey, there's an English kindergarten too, so that's about it,
Kiki, well I guess I'm too old. All I can do is say hi, nice me choo choo.
Kiki I can still use advanced language!
Kiki, don't you know how to do that?
Whats the Merel
Glad you like it~ Isn't that what you mean?
What's Kiki?
What is that?
You seem like a native English speaker
This also means it's nice to meet you~
Kiki, are you serious?
Why can't you just say Nice Mitsutu? Kiki is classy
Kiki, you're not kidding, are you~?
You have to learn from me~
Kiki, you're awesome, teach me a trick, native speaker teacher
Okay~~ Let's start with our ABC~
The sound is definitely Twinkle Twinkle Little Star, right?
Didn't you say your brother is in the dorm right now?
Yeah, that's right. I got the vaccine and am home now.
Oh, what vaccine did you get?
Pfizer! I got the second dose this time and I'm fine.
Did you get the second one yesterday or did you get it just now?
You got it yesterday, but it's still fine, it's sturdy
Oh, then you should be sick by now!?
Isn't it amazing?
Yeah, right, he's taking a nap while playing a game right now and he wakes up earlier than me;
Kiki, but I heard that the side effect is that you sleep a lot!
Oh really? I'm in big trouble. I sleep a lot anyway.
Kiki my friend slept for two whole days Kiki
Kiki and really?
I just slept like a newborn ㅜㅜ It would be hard if I got hit
That's right! I think I slept through all the sleep I had lost!
Oh my, you had a hard time, but you must be relieved now that you're out of it!
Kiki: That's why I got Monday blues and thought I was going to die.
Kiki Oh no~ Monday blues are incurable~ Egung
How many times a week do you meet your boyfriend?
I go there twice a week?
Or once a week?
Kiki: So you meet often on weekends?
Oh, that's right. On weekdays, I have to sleep at Chethra's house.
Kiki: Then are you still together?
Yeah, that's right. I have to go to class with you, but I just called you because I wanted to see you.
Kiki, your boyfriend also lives in Jochiwon?
No, my boyfriend lives in Daejeon~ Just call him~
Oh, Jochiwon and Daejeon were close?
Yeah, an hour by car? Kiki
The train is closer Kiki
That's right, your house is right next to the subway station. I'm jealous.
It takes 30 minutes to get to Daejeon by train, but an hour by car.
Right, is your boyfriend's house also near the subway station?
No, it's not near the station, it's just a little bit close?
Kiki, then I guess I should go to you~
Oh, but I'm going to take the last train~~
Aren't you guys planning on bringing your fat brother?
Yeah, that's absolutely forbidden because it's the embodiment of jealousy.
Oh my gosh Kiki is the same too
Kiki, even cats get jealous!
But do you remember when we lived together?
Was Momo also very jealous?
No, Momo covered all of Obok's poop and pee!
Oh my gosh ㅜㅜ Momo is so kind, she's an angel dog ㅜㅜ
Then shouldn't Oh Bok give this girl some too?
Kiki, you know Obokki will receive it, you know she's cute
So, even when Momo was around, he bullied her a lot!
Oh my ㅜㅜ Momo was such a kind older brother, you should learn from Oh Bok
That's rightㅜㅜ Just looking at a puppy makes Oh Bok-yi's tail turn into a raccoon tail!
Kiki Oh my goodness, even though dogs and cats are natural enemies, they still do a great job with Momo!
That's right! He's a brat from birth!
Kiki too~! The charm of cats is their arrogance and pride.
Does your boyfriend do any exercise these days?
Oh, my boyfriend goes to the gym!
Oh, you quit health PT too?
No no, just use the gym!
So you know how to use all the exercise equipment?
Well, aren't you gradually learning?
I just bought a ticket, can you tell me how to use it?
Wouldn't someone like the director tell us?
As you pass by?
Oh, Kiki, how long has it been since you came here?
It's been a week since you left, Kiki!
Kiki, you're totally hellish!
Are you going to hell?
Kiki Hellin is not Kiki, she's just trying to lose some weight
Oh really?
Your boyfriend is really skinny, isn't he?
Oh, it's all dried up, but my stomach is sticking out
Hey, do you like alcohol?
I don't drink that much either ㅜㅜ
What game are you going to play after you finish talking to me?
I'm playing a mobile game called Grand Chase
Wow, is that thing still alive?
Ah, that PC also recently opened!
Oh really?
Is that a game about fighting monsters?
Oh, you can catch monsters and fight people too.
Oh really?
What level are you?
Ah, I only play on mobile, but it hasn't been that long since I started, so it's probably over 110?
It hasn't been that long and it's already 110?
It seems like it'll go up a bit faster since it's Kiki Mobile?
Don't you do anything like that?
Oh my, I paid 10,000 won haha I paid too much haha
Kiki, investing ten thousand won every month?
Kiki, no, not even ten thousand won a month, just a small amount sometimes when I'm in a hurry
Yeah, I can do that much!
Yeah, yeah, I haven't even spent 30,000 won yet.
Is there an overseas travel destination on your bucket list?
I would like to go to either Egypt or Iceland.
Do you know a YouTuber named Bokyeom?
Bokyeom?
No, I don't know, is he a guy who looks like Boha?
Don't you know the YouTuber Boyru, the first president?
Oh, the kid who's doing boyru?
I only knew it for a little while when I was watching Boyru
Kiki, that guy is traveling in Egypt right now!
Wow, I'm jealous - I want to see the Egyptian pyramids and sphinx
Wow, I saw a video of the visit to that pyramid, and it was really big.
Oh my goodness ㅜㅜ There's a Pizza Hut in Egypt that has a view of the pyramids
Oh right Kiki but it doesn't taste that good Kiki
Kiki, really?
As expected, there is no way to avoid the limitations of taste in Egypt.
Kiki recommends the camel ride in Egypt!
Wow, that would be fun. A camel's back is made of fat.
They say there are two types of camels!
How did you know to do that Kiki Genius
Do you like rainy days?
Yeah I like it raining I like it humid
Kiki, if it's humid, it'll get moldy.
Oh, I don't like that, but I like it because it moisturizes my skin.
Kiki's Laughing Is it because of the humidity that I'm so wet right now?
Kiki, is that so?
It's humid today?!
The sun is shining brightly
I don't know, but I won't wash it anyway
Kiki, it looks like it's just oil; wash it off a bit
Kiki, it seems like your face is shiny now Kiki
Kiki Oh please save my skin ㅜㅜ My skin is like a rainy season
Kiki, that's right Kiki, but I like moderate rain
Wow, if I'm going to get off, I'd rather get off with a bang
Noㅜㅜ If it rains too much, all the crops in my garden will be ruinedㅜ
Ah, people who do agriculture and fisheries products must have a hard time, right? ㅜㅜ I was just thinking about myself
Kiki, it rained a lot this time so I think all the cabbages will die ㅜ
Wow ㅜㅜ Is this why greenhouse farming is good?
Wow, there was so much talk about Samsung's inheritance tax, and it finally came to light.
Oh, that's right. It was really expensive. How did it explode?
Chairman Lee Kun-hee is dead and his assets have been inherited!
Yeah, the inheritance tax is 40%?
It was so high
Right, how much do you think the inheritance tax will be?
Oh, I see, how many trillion did you do?
Right, 1.4 trillion, is this true?
Wow, seriously, shouldn't we sell Samsung right now?
Oh, so the article saying that Samsung is up for sale is no joke!
Oh my gosh ㅜㅜ They donate things like paintings and such to reduce inheritance tax.
Hehehe, so the amount you cut is 1.4 trillion?
Wow, that's amazing. Why are you taking so much? This is so~
So ㅜㅜ isn't the government a total robber!?
So it seems like our country is making unearned income.
In a survey conducted in our country, more than 50% of people answered that it is true that the taxes they pay are not being used properly!
Oh my gosh ㅜㅜ Well, it would be great if they disclosed it transparently~ They take too much tax
Do you know about digital tax?
Digital tax?
What is that again?
I didn't know, but other countries are also proposing to introduce this tax similar to ours!
Wow, in the whole world,?
Are you deducting taxes related to Haiti?
For example, we see things like our Wave as a flat rate!
Hey, are you saying the government will collect taxes for exchanging digital information?
That's right, in the end it's our taxes that we pay.
ㄷ ㄷ Evada, there are so many different things, can you please reduce one of them?
So the issue now is how much percentage to take!
ㅡㅡ Even though it is the digital age of the 4th industrial revolution, they are charging taxes on basic things!
Yeah ㅜㅜ This also seems like it'll be really hard to take off ㅜ
Just give me a disgusting house and deduct taxes from it ㅜㅜ
Kiki Ah, I admit it ㅜㅜ If this is introduced, our flat rate will go up again, right?
Oh my gosh ㅜㅜ Is this the era where I can't even listen to music freely? What kind of 4th industrial revolution is this?
Taxes are being taken away in a revolutionary way ㅜ
Kiki, that's a revolution, that's how you collect taxes.
Did you see the eyelash extension makeup I showed you?
Oh, wow, the price is cheap and the reviews are good
Right? That looks like it'll be a real Etude hit!
Wow, I really need to buy it and try it when my eyes get better.
Are your eyes feeling bad right now?
Oh, I just had surgery on my under eye area, and it still gets red sometimes.
Oh, hasn't it been quite some time since you had the surgery?
Yeah, it's been over a month, but I guess I'm not feeling well~
Recovery is really taking a bit longerㅜ
Yeah, that's right. My skin is not doing well these days as I'm getting older.
I'm going crazy ㅜㅜ I don't lose weight well ㅜ
Kiki, I won't lose weight and my wounds won't heal!
Kiki, we're still in our 20s. It'll get worse when we hit our 30s.
Kiki started in the middle of the year, now we have to go into management more strictly
Hey, you know we're almost in our late twenties, right?
Okay, tomorrow or the day after tomorrow, I'll be seven years old, Lucky Seven^^,
What kind of surgery did you have on your eyes?
I had an entropion surgery on my lower eyelid
Is that also double eyelid surgery?
No, no, it's not double eyelids, it's the bottom, not the top
Is that surgery done under anesthesia?
Yeah, I got two anesthetic shots in each eye.
Oh, you're injecting the anesthetic directly into the eye?
Yeah, the fat under my eyes doesn't really hurt.
Kiki, really?
Good thing, when is the surgery time?
Maybe because I was so nervous, the surgery took about an hour.
After the surgery, doesn't it hurt when the anesthesia wears off?
When I get sick, I have to take medicine right away Kiki
ㅜㅜThat's right. They told me to take it after about 2 hours, but I should just take it as soon as I leave the hospital!
That's right Kiki, you should just buy water and drink it ㅜㅜ
Kiki I heard that story and held it in, but I took some medicine and I felt like I was dying.
Kiki, there is a time when you have to take medicine, so if possible, take the medicine before you get sick.
I just told you that I ordered it on Baemin!
Yeah, how long does it take?
Does it take long?
No, I'm not here and I'm mad now!
Oh my god, why aren't you giving me chopsticks?
Why don't you leave it in front of the door?
No, I used it as disaster relief money! No
It's written!
Oh my, why is that?
I'm in the area but I can't get it delivered
No, I'm sure Baemin said that disaster relief funds can be used!
Ahh; Oh my, what the; It says that the re-posting is not working;
Then I was fooled!?
ㄷ ㄷ Maybe I should call and ask the boss?
Kiki ha, I had 20,360 won left so I bought a 20,000 won one!
Kiki oh kiki oh my; I ordered something expensive to spend money on it but it ended up costing me my own money
That's right, it's the final finale!
Kiki's big failure, the finale ended awkwardly
I have to spend the remaining 20,000 won somewhere else.
ㅜㅜOkay, okay, buy a man to man and wear it Kiki
Do you often listen to music when you commute to and from work?
Ah, I'm watching YouTube Kiki
Oh really?
What kind of shows do you watch mostly?
I watch game shows, cooking shows, and economic shows too~
Huh?
Economic broadcast?
Why?
Kiki, our school professor, economics professor, does something Kiki
Kiki Heh Kiki You see that on your way to and from work?
Kiki, oh, you explained it quite interestingly, Kiki.
Kiki, really?
Did you subscribe and like?
Then then ^^ You have a lot of subscribers?
Does that professor know that you are also a subscriber?
Kiki, you probably don't know either, I don't know either because there are so many Kiki students.
Kiki's so funny Kiki I listen to music on my way to and from work!
Are you listening to the song on Wave?
No I listened to it on YouTube Kiki
Ah Kiki, do you just listen to YouTube videos?
Have you seen Attack on Titan?
Yeah, I think I saw it a little bit at the beginning?
Then you don't see it these days?
Yeah, I haven't seen it lately. It hasn't ended yet?
The manga ended in April of this year ㅜㅜ
Wow, it's been a long time. We've been doing this since we were in high school.
That's right Kiki, but if you think about it, Conan hasn't ended yet either Kiki
Kiki Ah, well, you shouldn't be dragging Conan around like that Kiki
So who is the boss of the black organization?
Isn't that Kiki Miran? Actually, the pointy hair is a weapon
Kiki's pointy hair is real? Kiki
Mirani is the best at kicking!
Kiki, yeah, Bora is the strongest in the world
Kiki, that's right, I want to be someone like Bora~
Me too, ^^ Aren't you almost the granddaughter of a company bigger than Apple?
Kiki, that's right, her dad is like Bill Gates~
Yeah, a class where high school students go to auctions
I ended up skipping lunch
Oh my gosh, why do I have to eat -_-
Kiki Ha decided to wait until the autumn leaves open!
What time do they open there?
I don't know, maybe it opens late in the afternoon?
Are you opening late this afternoon? ㅠㅠ
Then I'm hungry ㅠㅠ
So I have a baby at home and I'm trying to survive by eating this!
Oh, is this a forced diet?
Right Kiki Ha, can you see me eating the goblin?
Yeah, I see you have a strong will today, Kiki
Kiki's so funny Kiki, no, the other houses' nacks are not opening their doors either!
But wasn't there a house you wanted to eat at?
Yeah but I just wanted to eat some squid ㅜ
ㅠㅠ Then I guess I'll have to endure it for a bit and then eat it ㅠㅠ
Yeah ㅜㅜ I don't know when it will open, but I'll leave it at that!
Okay, I've been waiting to eat Kiki and leave a review. I've been waiting to eat Kiki.
Oh, I guess there's still construction going on outside!
Why is it so noisy outside? ㅠㅠ
Wow, the construction noise is no joke haha
What's new, Kiki?
No, I guess the light came on yesterday because I just left it on!
Ah, but I don't like it when you make noise like that while resting ㅠㅠ
It's okay, it's soundproof here.
Oh, is that because the door is open now?
Yeah, that's right, Uncle Kiki, you're really loud!
Kiki, you work hard though ㅠㅠ Just hold on for a few more days ㅠㅠ
Haha, I've been hearing that for not just a few days, but 10 months now
Wow Kiki 10 months?
Isn't that too much? ㅠㅠ
Kiki, when they were tamping the ground the whole building was shaking
Kiki, weren't you shaking because you were afraid you'd die? Kiki
Kiki, no, I lived listening to it as a morning call. I woke up listening to it and went to work.
Oh, that's really good, isn't it? Kiki
Sister, what year is your car Morning?
Is it a 14 year old model?
I remember it like that, but Kiki doesn't know ㅠㅠ
Oh, our Byeolka is also a 14-year-old model, we're the same age!
Oh, next time we should throw a birthday party together, Kiki.
Kiki, our Byeolka was born in May, what about your older sister?
I'm in November haha my birthday party is coming soon ^^
Kiki Oh wow Me too Kiki Ah but I only wash on holidays
Kiki, why do you always clean it up? ㅠㅠ
Hmm, I'm at my sister's right now, so I don't know if she'll clean it for me.
Sister will be cleaning harder Kiki
Yeah, you went on a car wash date with your boyfriend?
Then I guess I'll be happy now. I guess I'll have to change my name to Kiki.
Kiki no, not yet your name is dad's name haha
Hey, Dad, your insurance premiums are going to be really high ㅠㅠ
Yeah, but we can't change it because we're not old enough ㅜ
I'll change it now ㅠㅠ Dad, you're spending a lot of money ㅠㅠ
Since when have you been working part-time, sister?
I think I've been doing it since I was in high school Kiki
Wow Kiki, you worked part-time after school?
Yeah, school's over!
Don't middle school students not wear them in stores because they are too young?
Kiki, but all the kids in the Daejeon underground shopping mall are middle school students!
Oh really?
They all look old?...
No, that's why it was on the news a lot!
Wow... Children that young shouldn't use this ㅠㅠ
Do you know how much kids were paid per hour back then?
Shouldn't you have given the minimum?
At that time, the lowest price was 5,000 won, but it was 3-4,000 won.
Hey, you eat money too?
This is really too muchㅡㅡ
That's why it was in the news a lot!
But you really have no conscienceㅡㅡ
right?
But the cafe and pizza in the Daejeon underground shopping mall were delicious.
Oh right Kiki I really like the pizza there Kiki
Sister, you said you went to see a friend. What did you bring with you?
Ah, you went there with only my face on?
Sirya?
Don't you usually take pizza or chicken with you when you go? Kiki
Ahh we brought Kiki out
Kiki, really?
Can I take you out?
Yeah, if you say you're going then they'll come out right away haha
Kiki Oh I know my younger brother and I are going to visit him with chicken
Kiki, it turns out, wanted to go out and eat meat...!
Kiki, hal kiki, so you bought meat to feed them?
Yeah, I ate meat and went to the PC room Kiki
Oh my, isn't that an outing instead of an interview?
Yes, Kiki, I'm going out, but when I tell you the day I go, most of the time I do that Kiki
Oh my gosh Kiki, and then you come back?
Yeah, and then he went in. Kiki, you look so pitiful.../
Kiki, I'm going to dieㅜㅜ But for now, I'm free~
Yeah, that was the case back then... I wish I could go back again haha
Sister, have you ever been to an academy?
I went to academy a bit when I was young Kiki
Where did you go in the hall?
Not Taekwondo!
I used to play piano Kiki. Are they polar opposites?
Oh my, you play the piano well, sis?
The twist is that Kiki still can't play the piano
Kiki I used to play the piano too, but I don't even remember now
Kiki, that's right, I think I did that when I was young, but what is this now? Kiki, you say that
Kiki, that's right Kiki. Then what about a study material other than piano?
Wow, the study guide Kiki gave me goosebumps. I was at eye level with Kiki.
Kiki Wow, back then, eye level was the best!
That and Kumon Kiki, but I think Kumon was more popular here!
Kiki, that's right, Kumon!
Kids these days teach in amazing ways!
Oh right, they said they teach differently than when we were young ㅠㅠ
Yeah my brother is doing it right now with his tablet PC~
Oh right, the smart world has arrived... ㅠ
Your father said he was in business. What kind of business did he do?
My dad runs that red ginseng store Kiki
Oh, is that the most famous place in Nonsan?
Kiki, are you sure you want to come to my house?~
Kiki, where was it? Hehe, is there a mart nearby?
Well~ Where is it~ Guess it, if you don't know Kiki you'll be disappointed haha
Kiki, you know, that guy~ He's the general~ But is there a red ginseng shop in Ogeori too?
Kiki right next to Jang Gun Mart
Yeah, there's a big sign in front of the Ogeori bus stop!
Kiki Phew, thank goodness~ It's no joke during the holidays there, right?
That's the peak time ㅠㅠ Then I'll go and help Kiki
Kiki Oh wow, that's really the moment~
I also buy a lot of red ginseng as gifts!
Then I guess I'll have to come to your house and buy one~
Right Kiki, I guess I'll have to go in 3 months!
Kiki, time flies! Lunar New Year is coming soon ㅠㅠ
That's right ㅜㅝ It hasn't been that long since Chuseok!
But after the Lunar New Year, Chuseok feels far away Kiki
Sister, don't you want to date right now?
Yeah, I think I'm still more comfortable alone!
When did you say your last relationship was? ㅜㅜ
It's been so long I don't even remember... (gulp...)
No ㅜㅜ Sister, what do you think about long distance relationships?
Ah, I think long distances will be a bit difficult ㅠㅠ My friend is having a hard time, Kiki
Yeah, I've been on long distances too, it's been tough.
Yeah... Long distance isn't something that just anyone can do ㅠㅠ
Yeah, we broke up in the beginning too, we didn't see each other often haha
But now I'm used to it and he's the best, right?
Yeah, that's right, Kiki, we're totally united in loyalty now!
Kiki If that's the case, then we're a family now. Family
Kiki, that's right, Kiki, we definitely send each other holiday gifts~
Yeah, you should get married quickly!
Hmmmm~ I'm going to enjoy my 20s to the fullest~
Oh my gosh, I'll be waiting for you in your 30s Kiki
Do you know how old your children are now?
Well, I just guessed, I don't know for sure ㅠㅠ
Oh really?
Did you bring it when you visited the grave?
Yeah, I brought them here when the kids were older ㅠㅠ
I see. How did you come to bring him here?
I kidnapped Kiki while she was giving me some food on the road.
Oh, have you taken Kiki to the hospital?
Yeah, of course I have to go to the hospital ㅠㅠ He's my baby now ㅠㅠ
Kiki Oho, what did you say when you first took her to the hospital?
The condition is not bad. Kiki said she ate a lot of food and lost weight. Haha
Thank goodness the stray cat that I feed has stomatitis.
Oh my gosh ㅠㅠ Then I guess I'll have to go to the hospital a lot ㅠㅠ
But this kid has to have all his teeth pulled outㅜ
Wow, how am I supposed to eat if all my teeth are pulled out?
It's okay because felines swallow them, not chew them!
Ah, but it still looks a bit weird...ㅠㅠ Poor thing...
Sister, are there any sports games you enjoy watching these days?
No, I don't watch games these days Kiki
really?
I guess women watch soccer a lot these days too?
Oh right, it seems like you're doing some variety shows too!
Kiki, really?
I don't know about that, but what is it?
The girls who hit the ball &lt; Was this it? Kiki
Girls playing soccer!
Oh, by any chance is it true that the comedian *** is appearing?
*** and *** these guys are coming out Kiki
Ahh Kiki, if it's ***, I definitely have to see it?
Sister, have you seen the exercise fat?
Then he really wasn't a joke Kiki
Yeah, Kiki, isn't this a hit?
How many kilos did you deadlift?
Oh, I didn't see that, but what about the gun shooting? I saw that, Kiki.
Kiki, did you shoot too? I didn't see that!
That's really dope Kiki, check it out quickly!
Kiki Wow I only watched boxing, I have to watch it!
Yeah, that's probably why it came up. Be sure to look it up, Kiki.
Sister, do you know the hot and cold space hippopotamus?
Hot hot hot isn't that a gaming YouTuber? I think I've heard of him Kiki
That's right, he's the famous Beggar!
Yeah, I think I've heard the name Dog before, but why Dog?
I watched it on YouTube this time and it was amazing.
Are you just flying around playing games? Kiki
Did you know that the kids give you missions and stuff?
No, I don't know about that ㅠㅠ Did they give you a mission while playing the game?
For example, with archery, you can get 100 star winds with one headshot!
Oh, but did all of that work? Kiki
No, every time I do that, I get that star wind, and it seems like I really take a lot of money, haha
Ah, but those are the people who make money doing that... They're different from us...
Yeah, that's really true. I saw the video earlier, and it was a 1 million won mission if you shot a head with a crossbow? That's it.
Wow, awesome. So you earned 1 million won?
Boohoo, and you know what?
It's 1 million won every time you do it, so more than that,
Wow... Then how much did you earn? I'm jealous.
Sister, have you ever been to Daegu?
No, I went to Busan but not Daegu ㅠㅠ What about you?
The last time I went to Busan was when I was in elementary school, and never to Daegu!
Kiki, why do you want to go to Daegu?
Oh, but what is Daegu famous for?
Daegu is famous for eggs that cook on the floor!
Kiki right, Africa oh it's still warm
Kiki Woong, they say it's really hot there, Kiki
Kiki, that's right, I know an older brother there and he's still turning on the air conditioner.
Wow, isn't it too cold to turn on the air conditioner now?ㅠㅠ
But that's Africa~ It's on a different level from here~
Yeah, but I still want to go there at least once, Kiki
Haha, Kiki, that's right. Do you want to make a date with me?
Oh, good, good. Let's go on a trip, even if it's within the country!
Oh, good, good. This time, let's go with my sister's car~
No no no I'm going to take the train! Train~
Are you thinking of going to see the fall foliage this fall?
Yeah, it would be nice to go see the fall foliage~ and get some fresh air~
Kiki, that's right, I highly recommend Sejong Arboretum! I highly recommend it!
Oh, it's looking nice there now?
Omg I went there last year and it was really red!
Then, I'll try to go next time I get a girlfriend...
Oh, why can't I go with my friends?
The kids are busy meeting their lovers...
Kiki, oh my sister, you're also there, go go go
I hate Kiki. I won't tell you anyway. The two of you are just being affectionate. ㅠㅠ
Kiki ha I'm crying there and there are animals too!
animal?
Is it like a zoo?
Well, there are rabbits, deer, sheep, and things like that.
Oh, I should go and look at the sheep. Kiki
Kiki is right, but there are monkeys too? The kids are a bit pitiful,
Ah, I think the monkey is a bit pitiful ㅠㅠ because he has no freedom ㅠㅠ
Wow, this time Samsung Electronics' inheritance tax is a huge hit.
inheritance tax?
It's always an issue there ㅠㅠ
Yeah, wow, the inheritance tax is really huge.
There's an article saying how much is the inheritance tax?
Joe, it's a unit, it's a really unimaginable identity
Wow... but you have the money to pay for it... daebak
No, so this time, Samsung is selling off one of its companies.
What are you selling?
It's not heavy industry, right? ㅠㅠ
No, isn't that SDS?
What company is that... I guess they're trying to get rid of something that's not well known ㅠㅠ
No, Samsung is a famous place, but the inheritance tax is really scary.
But I guess it comes out because there's that much of it ㅠㅠ I'm just jealous..
Kiki Hmm, it looks like the only one laughing here is the government!
Haha, so this is how taxes are paid haha
Kiki, right Kiki, are we receiving disaster relief funds with this?
Ahh... Then I don't have much to say haha
Sister, do you know about the digital tax among taxes? Kiki
Digital tax?
I think it's the first time I've heard that, but what does Kiki look like?
Around the world, there are bills being passed to impose a tax called digital tax.
Then what do you mean by sticking it all on the machine?ㅡㅡ
No, we have something like Netflix!
Digital tax is added to the flat rate.
Ah... I thought it was for things like home appliances, but isn't there a tax on those?
But now, there is another thing called digital tax!
Wow, this is really crazy ㅠㅠ I hate it... Don't raise taxes ㅠㅠ
So, digital tax, it seems like they're just slapping everything together!
Just give me money~ This is it ㅠㅠ They're trying to collect taxes now, ugh..
Kiki: That's right, in the end we end up paying for everything!
What's the use of receiving money? I've got more for the rest of my life. Kiki
Kiki, I'm dying from paying taxes~ I'm crying
What I'm saying is that I'll be a workaholic my whole life ㅠㅠ Worker ant, chubby chubby...!
Dirt ㅜㅜ I'll work hard today too!
I'll work hard tomorrow too!
Sister, what kind of basic cosmetics do you use?
I'm using Avene right now!
Oh, my sister also uses Avene and she said it's good!
Yeah, that sounds good because it's mild!
That's right, my sister has sensitive skin too, so she uses that a lot!
Um, should I say that cosmetics are soft?
Yeah, it really looks innocent at first glance~
It's so gentle and soft that I feel trembling when applying foundation~ Kiki
Does Kiki-sister also apply it by dabbing it on her makeup foam?
I put the skin on cotton and apply it!
So Kiki, my older sister writes like that too. Is that the blue bottle?
Oh, that one has essence and lotion?
Oh, that's right! Aren't you a blue soldier?
Yeah, I used that and then changed it to something that only has transparent skin!
Oh, Kiki, did you buy that at Olyoung!?
Yeah, that's right. It's sold out every time I go there, so I have to look carefully and buy it.
Sister, you've been eating red ginseng since you were little, so you don't get sick!
Oh, really?
But I was healthy before I started taking red ginseng Kiki
Kiki, are your parents okay?
Is it the power of genetics!?
Yes, no one in my family is seriously ill or anything. Kiki
That's right. In our house, the youngest uncle picks herbs from the mountain and eats them.
Wow, wow, isn't that the best? Kiki, give me some too
Kiki, we just chew on the ginseng and eat it~
Kiki, can't you just chew on it and eat it?
are you okay?
Kiki, yes, I use it and dip it in honey, but I still use it Kiki
Kiki, it feels like the kind of thing that comes out sometimes when you go to a sushi restaurant
Kiki, no, our roots are different~
Mom?
Kiki, are you eating something really big and strong?
Kiki But I don't get along with ginseng. It makes my body heat up too much!
Kiki, so you must be hot because you ate too much
Kiki That's right, so I don't eat it much these days
Kiki, if you happen to come out later, give it to me~
Where do you buy things like clothes, sister?
I just go to places like underground shopping malls and buy Kiki
Oh really?
Sister, do you often go to the Daejeon underground shopping mall?
Yeah, I'll just go and buy it. I don't have any greed for Kiki's clothes.
Kiki Me too Kiki I buy trendy clothes and wear them for a year and throw them away
Kiki I just buy the basic ones and throw them away when they get old. Kiki
Yeah Kiki I'm going to wear loose pants this time so I'm going to buy one from ZigZag
Kiki Oh, that app?
Didn't you use brandy in the past?
I'm just using both alternately!
Kiki, do the clothes there look nice?
Yeah, that's also Kebakaya, you have to look carefully before buying!
Yeah, the material is really important now ㅠㅠ
But what I think is most important is coupons haha
Yeah, I have a coupon for the exact same thing, so I went and bought it. Kiki
Kiki, that's right, I bought it this time with a 15% discount coupon!
Oh, you bought it frugally! Good job Kiki.
Sister, do you happen to know the singer **?
Yeah, I know, Twice sisters~
Kiki, that's right, I listened to the new song this time!
No, I haven't heard the one that came out this time ㅠㅠ Do you like the song?
This song is just their style!
Is that a song that feels like that? Kiki
Um, first of all, the title is Mafia!
Ah, I have a feeling, Kiki
Kiki, that's right, Kiki's clothes are also those plastic clothes that JYP likes
Kiki, oh my Kiki, why did you make the kids wear those clothes?ㅠㅠ
Kiki, no, really cool. Does it feel a bit like a uniform?
Hmm, I can't imagine?
I guess I'll have to search for it Kiki
Kiki, this song is secretly addictive!
Idol songs must be addictive!
I admit, I chose this song as my 18th song at karaoke.
Oh, now it's song number 18? Kiki
That's great
Sister, did you know that even these days, Shin-chan is still unstoppable?
Yeah, that's popular right now. People are talking about it a lot. Kiki
Kiki, you're right, I saw it on Facebook this time.
Yeah, that's right. I heard they're really busy these days!
Kiki, that's right, I saw it while eating rice, it's exactly right
Kiki, you haven't contacted me recently to ask if I've been watching it?
Kiki Of course~ But I saw the episode about the dog lover this time?
Dog therapist?
Was there something like that in Crayon Shin-chan?
Oh my, it came out recently, so you don't know, right?
Ah, I don't know because I haven't watched Shinchan recently ㅠㅠ
Kiki, this is a video of a dog being groomed, it's really gross ㅜ
Kiki, are you ogling?
Wasn't Shin-chan funny? Kiki
No, to become the best dog groomer, Kiki wears a dog costume and barks because she knows the mind of a dog.
Oh, Kiki, aren't you friends with Whitey? Kiki
Kiki ha I don't know, I saw that and immediately turned it off Kiki
Kiki, you must have gotten a stroke while watching that Kiki
Can you recommend something for lunch today?
I'm craving pork soup, how about it?! Kiki
Oh, I don't like the country,
Then what do you like besides soup?~
Um~ First of all, nothing spicy!
If you don't like spicy food, I recommend the ribs!
rib?
I'm eating alone ㅜ Alone?
The level of eating alone is low, but the ribs~ Kiki are still delicious
Kiki No, I want to eat at homeㅜ
Then can you recommend some delivery food?
Kiki Yeah, that's right, delivery~~ No packaging either
I think it's lunch time so how about mala-tang?
Well, I said not spicy.
If you lower the spiciness of the mala tang, it won't be spicy and will be delicious haha
No no, not the red one!
Then should we just eat at a Chinese restaurant?
Have you never lived alone?
Hey Kiki, have you ever lived alone?
I'm in Seoul right now!
If you do it in Seoul, the price of housing will be incredibly expensive!
Kiki, I'm so scared, I'm so shocked ㅜ
Do you happen to know the approximate monthly rent price?
First of all, let's start with a really small room, room 50.
Oh man, I guess I should just start somewhere other than Seoul.
Have you decided where to go?
No, I just wanted to live alone~
just?
Have you saved some money?
money?
Of course I should take out a loan, I don't have money haha
Hey Kiki, where are you going?
I suddenly started to dream of living alone...
Hahaha, there's no such thing as romance, there's no such thing ㅜ
Hey no it's my dream I'll find out lol
Do you have a driver's license?
Are you out of the military?
Of course, I got it before Kiki went to the army.
Oh, you got it faster than I thought?
Yeah, just get it as soon as you get the age~
Kiki Oh, wasn't driving difficult?
I'm totally the best driver~ haha
Oh, you've never had an accident?
Yes, it's been 4 years but there have been no accidents yet.
Oh, how old are you now?
I'm 22 now! Kiki
3rd year since I was 19?
Oh, you really got it early?
Yeah, I like driving so I got it right away!
Do you have a license?
Of course I'm a first class average~
Oh, it's one piece?
When did you get it?
I was the only one who didn't know, Kiki
Kiki I got it as soon as I turned 20!
Oh, I see now haha
Are you working for a company right now?
No, there is no company yet, job seekers...
I see. So are you working part-time now?
Yeah, I just looked into part-time jobs and went for an interview!
Oh, where did you go for the interview?
It was just a convenience store part-time job, but they even interviewed me.
I see. Do they pay a lot of wages there?
Of course it's the minimum wage. Kiki gave me 8750.
Wow, how many hours do you work?
It was written 10 hours a day, 3 days a week!
Wow, 10 hours each?
Are you doing this a lot?
I need money urgently right now, so I have to work hard even if it means working part-time...
Oh my gosh ㅜㅜ Are you giving me all the holiday pay?
Oh, that's not possible. It's rare for convenience stores to give out holiday allowances. Kiki
Oh no, that won't do! Report it!
But I think that's normal for convenience stores!
How many months has it been since you left the military?
I'm currently in the reserves, 9 months out of service~ haha
Kiki Oh Reserve Army~ You're so cute~
Okay~ Now you're in your first year, Kiki
Kiki, are you going to give your girlfriend some flower shoes?
Of course I prepared shoes and cake
Oh, the cake is a lettering cake?
Yeah, Kiki, you definitely have to do it with lettering.
Oh, what did you use for the Kiki stationery?
I don't remember, Kiki's phrase was a bit long
Kiki O, what size cake did you make?
I ordered that in the size they sell at the cafe!
Oh, you really did a good job!
Okay~ I've been discharged from the military so now I'm free~
Kiki, don't you have reserve force training again?
maybe?
If you just stay there, it will go away
How far did you go in school?
I have now graduated from high school!
Oh, I see. Me too. Were you in the business world?
I am a Meister High School student, upgraded version of Kiki
Kiki Oh, then what is a specialized high school?
That's probably what the industry has changed its name to!
Kiki Ah then I'm just an unemployed person ㅜ
Hey, that's it. Kiki didn't go to college and just got a job.
I see. Are you working at your current job?
Yeah, I went right after graduating so I wouldn't have to go to Kiki University.
I see. So you must have gotten a job at a good place?
No, I just got a job at a small to mid-sized company.
Small business?
But isn't it a good company?
It's just a small business in an industrial complex~
I see. So you're still working hard?
Yeah, I'm working hard every day now ㅠㅠ
What is your family structure like?
I'm alone with my parents, this is the end Kiki
I see. Your parents must really love you!
Yes, I think he loves me even more because I'm an only child.
Kiki Oh, you should be good to your parents.
I've always been a good, dutiful son!
Kiki Oh, are you sure that's true?
Of course Kiki's parents love me so much~
Kiki, you always make seaweed soup for your parents' birthdays.
Seaweed soup?
Actually, I'm not good at cooking...
Kiki, these days there are so many recipes out there that I can make it.
Then, should I do it for my parents' wedding anniversary too?
Oh but I also wonder about that
I'm worried about what to do about this ㅠㅠ
Kiki I don't want to take it though
okay?
Then I guess I'll have to think about it a little more
How many days have you been with your girlfriend?
I guess it's been more than a year now?~
Oh wow, we dated longer than I thought~
Hey no~ Kiki is still a baby
Were you younger?
Was it an association?
Don't you remember?
I'm young and my girlfriend is older than me.
Oh, how many years is the age difference between you and your girlfriend?
Kiki, we're two years apart. I'm two years younger than you.
Oh my gosh, my girlfriend is so talented~~
I admit that the girlfriend I have is capable~
Kiki, so that's what it's like. When is your girlfriend's birthday?
It's November and it's almost here so I'm going to have to get ready!
Oh, do you have a gift in mind?
I don't have one yet, but I'm going to start picking candidates soon haha
Oh, what is it? Tell me in private, haha
Hey, it's still a secret. I'll tell you later.
Is your kid alive and well now?
I was sick yesterday too, so I went to the hospital again...
Oh my, why didn't you say it was okay last time...
Kiki, yesterday my back hair fell out and I got a patch
Oh my gosh ㅜㅜ Why is that a deal?
First, I did a culture test and they said it would take a week.
Culture test?
Is there such a test?
Yeah, I heard it takes over a week to test for mold.
Oh, I see. You even got mold. I'm so sad.
I don't know yet, but it looks right to me
Wow, you lost a lot of hair?
No, it was just the back that was completely missing!
Is that something that just happened all of a sudden or has it always been like that?
It fell right near where I applied the heartworm medication.
Oh, it's not because of the heartworm medication?
That's what they say, but just in case, I did a test
Are you doing any exercise these days?
I'm going to play soccer today Kiki
Oh really?
Do you play soccer with your friends?
No, not friends, just a club!
Oh really?
You joined the club too?
Yeah, I signed up because I wanted to play soccer.
Oh, so you're doing it with people you don't know?
Yeah, I don't know them, but I guess I'll just go and see~
Oh, I guess men like that kind of thing
It would be so nice to go and get to know each other and have a meal together!
Right? Oh, so you decided to eat together?
Yeah, we decided to play soccer and have a drink~
Hey, but is that possible now?
Kiki, instead of a restaurant, we just do it on a bench
Oh, I see. Are you packing a lunch?
Maybe I should buy it at a convenience store and eat it?
What games do you play a lot these days?
I think I play bag a lot these days
Bagner, can you eat chicken by yourself?
Yeah, I'm a vegetarian, but I eat chicken a lot these days.
Oh, you're really good at it, aren't you?
Hey, no, you used to have a bag too, right?
But I just followed behind
Then do you want to follow me around and act as my bag? Kiki
Kiki, that's right, I'll give the kids bandages and shots and stuff ㅜ
Very nice pose, do that to me too haha
Kiki I get it but I don't know if you die in the beginning ㅜ
If you survive well in the beginning, you'll be fine!
Kiki, can I survive well in the beginning?
If you stick right behind me, then it's possible
Kiki Oh okay, just give me the bandages and the injections.
Yeah Kiki, you're going to be my bag.
Are you going on a trip this time?
i envy you
Oh my gosh, Kiki, I'm so excited right now ㅠㅠ
Where did you decide to go with your girlfriend?
This time, I decided to go to Jeju Island for the first time.
Oh wow, how many nights and days are you going to Jeju Island?
I've already made a reservation for 3 nights and 4 days~ Kiki
I'm jealous ㅜㅜ Can you get cheap plane tickets?
Yeah, round trip plane tickets are about 30,000 won per person? Haha
Wow, they're giving it away for so cheap~
Right? Kiki
I think it's because I made a reservation a long time ago
Oh, when did you reserve the ticket?
Booked on Skyscanner 2 months in advance~ Kiki diligence is the answer
What is Skyscanner?
What's the app name?
Yeah, it's an app for booking plane tickets. The prices there are cheaper.
Oh really?
I need to download that app too!
Download it and reserve it for yourself too
Where do you live now?
I'm completely in the south, Kiki's port city Busan~
Kiki Oh, how's the weather like for you guys now?
It's pouring right now, Kiki's voice is so scary
Oh my goodness, is it raining a lot now?
Yeah, I saw someone's umbrella break.
Wow, wow! It's October now, isn't it the rainy season?
To that extent?
I thought a typhoon was coming, the wind was blowing so hard
Wow, wow, it's sunny here?
okay?
It's the same country, but why is the weather so different...
So, do you have any reason to go out of the house?
No, thank goodness it's not there. I hate getting rained on ㅠㅠ
I hate getting rained on too ㅜ
So I'm just going to stay home today
Yeah yeah, on a day like today, staying home is the best!
Yeah, let's just stay home together
Do you know the YouTuber ***?
huh?
I don't know, but I heard it somewhere...
Oh my, there's a YouTuber?
There's no news right now ㅜ
What did it say?
YouTubers are always an issue these days
Do you know about health shots?
First time hearing about it, isn't it just a health injection? Kiki
This guy got a health shot and now he's having side effects
okay?
How severe were the side effects?
I have a ton of bruises all over my body,
omg?
Is that because you got a health shot?
Yeah, I think this is a side effect, but it's more of an issue because of the hospital's attitude.
Why is the hospital's attitude like this?
You're not going to apologize, are you? Haha
They said they talked about the refund policy there, but Kiki is sick like this
Hospitals think more about money than health...
So I want to know where this hospital is!
I would never go there. That's totally out of the ordinary.
Do you know the famous Chinese group called Hengda?
Yeah, I've heard of the Hungda Group!
Do you know what projects that group is working on?
why?
Are you working on the project?
What is it, Kiki, I wonder
You said you were going to build an artificial island there!
omg?
Where are we going to build an artificial island?
As expected, it's a Chinese group
So you knew about the Hungda Group?
Wow, that's amazing. They're setting up a project to build an artificial island...
Yeah, that's right, but this is a mess right now,
okay?
Why is there such a fuss about just making an artificial island?
Now, I invested for the future, but I suffered a lot of damage because of Corona.
I see. Corona is a problem everywhere these days...
Hey, do you know how much debt there is here?
Just looking at it, it looks like there will be a lot Kiki
Hey Kiki, 354 trillion won, does that make sense?
Wow, why is the unit so high?
Is that possible
Where do you get your hair cut?
I went to the hair salon in my neighborhood and got my hair cut
Is that your regular beauty salon?
Yeah Kiki, the designer there is my friend
Oh, how many years have you been going?
I've been going there since I finished my first year of military service~
Do you keep going there because you like it there?
No, but the service and price are good haha
Oh, how much does a men's haircut cost?
How about 12,000 won there?
It's cheap compared to the surrounding area Kiki
But don't you think the price of hair cuts has gone up a lot these days?
Well, back in the old days, I used to cut it for 5,000 won
Yes, I also had 5,000 won when I was in middle school.
Yeah, I did that back then, but now it's basically a ten-thousand won unit.
Yeah ㅜㅜ That's why I don't go to the hair salon often
But I have to go because it's dirty. What can I do? ㅠㅠ
Are you taking any medication these days?
I'm taking rhinitis medicine these days because it's the changing of seasons
Your rhinitis is so bad that you have to take medicine!
They say it's allergic rhinitis, but it seems more like chronic rhinitis...?
I see. So that can't be fixed?
They said there is no cure?
So I'm just going to hold out with medicine
I see. Did you get a prescription from a nearby hospital?
No, I just went to the pharmacy and bought some medicine that was right for me.
Oh, what kind of medicine are you buying? Are you buying it in pill form?
Yeah, it's a pill, and it works well for me and I don't have any tolerance.
Oh really?
There are a lot of nasal drops that you spray directly into your nose, right?
Ah, that's too strong and builds up a lot of tolerance in the nose, so pass on that!
Oh really?
So how long has it been since you took the medication?
It's been almost 2~3 years now...?
Wow, wasn't it hard when you went to the military?
At that time, I just held on with evil
Are there any apps you use a lot these days?
I only use Instagram and Facebook these days Kiki
What about things like shopping apps?
Of course, I don't use anything other than Coupang
You're a Coupang Man too, Kiki. Did you buy that flat-rate coupon too?
Of course you mean Rocket WoW Membership?
That's right Kiki, people use that a lot!?
Yeah, that's really convenient and it only costs 2900 won per month.
Yeah, it's super cheap. Wasn't it all free shipping?
Yeah, and returns are free too, so that's nice~
Oh really?
Free returns?
At that price!?
Is it a total blessing?
This is why I can't let go of Coupang
So I guess I should switch to Coupang too!
Come quickly, Coupang is a new world Kiki
Wow, this is really why people only use Coupang!
Yeah, I'm one of them~
What music do you listen to these days?
I'm into ballads these days Kiki
Oh really?
Whose is it?
Have you seen ***'s new song that came out recently?
***?
What was that guy's hit song?
*** This is my first time hearing this, but I'm listening to it because I like the song!
That person probably has a really nice voice!?
Oh right, I don't know Kiki's name, but her voice is really good.
Kiki, isn't she a little husky?
So I guess a sweeter song is possible!
Yeah ㅜㅜ I really like the song *** ㅜ
The title is &quot;Your Appearance&quot;, listen to it now haha
Kiki, the title alone looks good, I have to listen to it!
Yeah, I need to turn on the music app and listen to it right now.
Kiki Okay I have to watch the video to see you actually singing it!
Then, it would be perfect to search for it on YouTube and watch it live~
Do you still watch cartoons and stuff?
Yeah Kiki, I like comics~
Oh really?
What are you watching these days?
Have you ever heard of Comic Maple Story?
Are you still reading MapleStory comics? Kiki
Yeah, this is something a lot of people used to see.
Kiki, but isn't that finished yet?
It's already out, volume 100 is the last one, so I'm just going to keep reading!
Wow, that's been around since I was in elementary school.
Yeah, I'm watching it now and it's actually kind of fun..
Kiki: That must have been when Latte Volume 5 came out, right?
Wow, that was a long time ago. I knew about it from volume 50.
Kiki, that was published once a month, right?
Yeah so it's been a long time since it ended haha
Oh, Kiki, what episode have you watched so far?
It's volume 43 now, but there's still a lot left...
Oppa, are you having chicken jjigae for lunch today too?
Yeah Kiki of course
Today I ate chicken and beef stew
Hey, what's up with the beef today?
Of course, beef is also a lump of protein.
That's right Kiki
Do you eat beef often?
Ahn Kiki
It's expensive so I don't eat it often, I only eat it when I feel like it?
Kiki Oh my gosh I want to eat beef with wasabi on top!
Ah... I tried it because people these days eat it like that, but it wasn't that good...
Oh really?
Was that a total revolution for me?
Hmm, why on earth would you put tasteless wasabi on delicious meat?
Huh? No
Honey, have you ever tried Ichadol?
Huh? What is this secondary stone? This is my first time hearing about it.
This is a specialty restaurant for Ichadol Chadolbagi. So delicious!
Ah, I didn't know because I only eat chicken stew all the time and I don't eat out much...
Wasabi takes away the richness of the beef jerky!
Hmm, if you feel like it, just season it with ssamjang...
Why wasabi?
Did you personally buy all of your home appliances?
no
(I haven't bought it yet, so I'm just using the options that are available?)
Then, does your brother also go with the full option?
Yeah, usually you have to go with full options.
Whenever I need something, I buy it and go to Kiki
Kiki, I see
I also came in with full options!
That's right
If you're not going to buy your own car, I think the fully-loaded option is the best. Kiki
that's right
But I have a question!
Huh? What?! Are you curious?
Ask me lol
Honey, how many years have you been living alone?
It's been... two years now?
Should it be around that time?
So if the curtains break, do I have to fix them?
Um, were curtains originally an option?
Yeah, that's right
But this was not cool from the beginning!
If it was there from the beginning, you should tell the landlord and he should fix it.
Then I don't have to worry about anything?
Yeah, that's right
The landlord will take care of it.
Oppa, is there a subway in Daegu?
Yeah of course Kiki
But it's a metropolitan city, so they ignore it! ㅡㅡㅋ
Oh, I don't care~
I asked because I didn't know~
Aren't there subways in places like Kiki's metropolitan area?
Is that so?
I don't know!
Um, I think the places with subways are Seoul, Gyeonggi-do, Daegu, and Busan.
Nonsan is a city, so there won't be a subway, right? Kiki
Yeah... I guess it won't happen?
It doesn't happen often in poetry
Oh my gosh, I see
And we also have a military base, so we won't have to dig the ground, right?
Kiki, won't the soldiers dig up the ground?
I don't even want to go to Nonsan
Kiki ehye Kiki I guess I'll just buy a car later~
That's right
Buying a car is the most convenient and best Kiki
Kiki, that's right. How much does a new Morning cost these days?
Well, if you add all the options, wouldn't it be around 2,000 at most?
Wow, it's a lot more expensive than I thought?
Well this is just my guess, just search it up Kiki
What was the highest paying part-time job your brother had?
I used to work part-time at a gorosoe shop and they paid a lot of money. Kiki
Oh my god, a goro?
Are you talking about tree sap?
Yeah, that's right
If you take it out with a water jug from Santa Claus, it's over Kiki
Wow, Kiki. So you have to climb a mountain for that too?
Right Kiki
But it was really so hard I almost died
Oh my gosh, how old were you back then?
At that time, before I enlisted in the military, I was around 20 years old?
Wow, you were a young and energetic person back then, was it hard?
Yeah, it's really hard
But I did it because they gave me a lot of money Kiki
Kiki, I see
How much was the daily wage at that time?
Well, at that time, they gave me 200,000 won a day, Kiki.
Wow, wow, how did you get down after receiving that gorosoe water?
The owner installed a water tank, so you can just pour water from the mountain into it. Kiki
Then, is that what you carry on your back?
Well, there is no carrying case, so you just have to carry it with your hands.
Oppa, was there something like a restaurant in the military base back then?
Yeah, right
There are restaurants where you can eat Kiki's food
no
I'm talking about a store like Papa!
Uh...? There's no such thing, Kiki
What kind of army would have something like that? - Kiki
These days, there are even burger joints inside military bases!
Oh, then it's not the military, Kiki
Just going camping and coming back?
It's not Kiki
The kids are having a hard time too~
Oppa, was that when the Choco Pie with Tears was the best?
Kiki, we could sell our souls for one Choco Pie Kiki
Kiki but there was also PX
Wasn't there something more delicious?
right
There is also PX, but I can't go often because the military salary is so low.
Wow, how much was a soldier's salary back then?
Well, when I was a private, I think it was around 140,000 won?
Your monthly salary is 140,000 won, right?
Right Kiki
140 thousand won per month
Soldiers who don't even receive minimum wage...
Oh my gosh ㅜㅜ Now I think it was 400,000 won!
So Kiki, if it's like that, I'll be discharged and buy a house Kiki
Oppa, did you have a teacher you liked when you were a student?
Um yeah there was a female teacher Kiki
Oh~ Oppa, when you were in high school? Or when you were in middle school?
Yeah, when I was in high school, my native English teacher was really pretty.
If you were a native English speaking teacher, which country were you from?
He was born in Korea, but was adopted to the US when he was young.
I see. But how did you come back to Korea?
Well, I don't know because I didn't ask about that.
I also liked native English speaking teachers when I was in middle school!
Was that native English teacher a foreigner?
We had a British male teacher!
Oh, Kiki, you look cool even when you see a gentlemanly British man
Wow, really, because of that teacher, the image of England seems to have improved a lot!
Oh, Kiki, that could be it
Our native English teacher was liked by all the boys in the school, Kiki
Kiki Yeah but we're too clingy so he leaves because it's burdensome Kiki
Wow, that was a bit too much
It's annoying if you stick too much, Kiki
Aren't you going to see your mom this weekend?
Yeah, I'm not going this week, I'm going next week.
I see
I'm going down to Nonsan at the end of October!
Oh, are you going to see your parents?
Should I buy you a gift?
no
I was camping with my friends and we passed by Nonsan while we were at it~
Ah, since you're here, why don't you have a meal? Kiki
I miss my parents
Yeah, that's what Kiki was going to do
And I have to go again in November!
Seoul and Nonsan are really far apart. Do you go down there often?
These days, the roads are well developed, so it doesn't take as long as you think!
Oh~ Kiki, so are you taking the train to Nonsan?
no
I mostly use the bus!
Wow, isn't the bus incredibly uncomfortable?!
I can't even go to the bathroom on the way
I don't go to the bathroom often, so it's okay!
Oh, that's good, Kiki
I feel a little scared when I drink Americano before getting on the bus.
Kiki I get motion sickness often so I just lie down and sleep!
Oh Hong Kiki I don't know if that's good or bad Kiki
Do you like daughters or sons?
Yeah, I'm definitely a son! Kiki
Kiki, really?
Nowadays, everyone wishes they had a daughter.
Yeah, these days everyone says they like daughters, but I don't think I'd be a good father if I had a daughter.
Oh my, where did you hear that?
You can be a good father!
I'm a little worried that if I let my daughter go, there'll be a curfew or something like that.
Kiki, I just want to raise my son with peace of mind
Kiki, that's right, my daughter is like that
But we have two daughters and there's no curfew!
Wow Kiki, your parents must be really nice people Kiki
There are only three sons in my house, and we all have curfews. Kiki
Wow, we were raised like we were herds by our father since we were little Kiki
When I was young, I envied such open-minded parents. Kiki
My dad found out a few months later that I was living alone.
Oh my gosh Kiki that's a bit Kiki
Isn't there too little communication?
Kiki no
I told you, my dad doesn't really listen unless it's something he needs to hear.
Kiki, your father must be a cheerful and kind person. Kiki
Kiki no
Not like that haha
Still, I wish I had parents like that, Kiki
Didn't you say your brother was allergic to dog hair?
no
I don't have a dog hair allergy Kiki
Oh, you said you had a younger sibling?
Ahn Kiki
There is no one in my family Kiki
I guess I was thinking wrong~
What do you think about turtles as pets?
Wow turtle cake Kiki
I was just growing up when I was in elementary school, and I was like Kiki
Oh really?
It grows, but did you bring it from nature?
Ahn Kiki
Are you selling it?
So I bought it and raised it along with a fish tank.
Oh really?
Even if you grow up, don't you live a long life?
Yeah Kiki but I'm in elementary school so what would I know?
If you just raise them carelessly, they will die early...
Wow ㅜㅜ I've been catching sight of land turtles lately!
Land turtle!?
Yeah, these days, they're raising all sorts of weird things, Kiki
Yeah Kiki
But I don't really care about land turtles!
Um, Kiki, then wouldn't it be boring to raise them?
What if the purpose is to neglect?
no
I wish I had a pet that could respect each other's privacy like that!
Oh, then I guess the cat would be okay too Kiki
Have you ever done any other exercise besides working out?
Yeah, of course
I did judo for 3 years in high school Kiki
Hey, if Kiki-oppa grabs me by the collar, I'll fall over right away?
Oh Kiki, that could be Kiki
Kiki, you can probably lift it with one hand
Kiki Oh, I won't bother you anymore~
Yeah yeah
If you mess with me, I'll run over and grab you by the collar Kiki
Kiki Ou How many hours does it take to get from Daegu to Seoul?
Wouldn't it take about 3 hours?
Three hours is enough time to escape by plane!
Kiki, there's a plane to Daegu too Kiki
What I said was Kiki the Train
Kiki Ah, there was a way like that.
Then why did you quit judo?
Well, it was just a hobby, so after I graduated, I didn't really want to do it. Kiki
You've been doing this as a hobby for three years?
When I was a student, I didn't study, I just did sports as a hobby Kiki
Kiki: So after school, you went to the judo gym and worked out?
Um, I start from 8th period until 6-7?
Did you go to the arcade often when you were a student?
Well, I don't go to the game room often, so I live in the computer lab at school since my major is information processing. Kiki
Can I play games in the school computer lab?
Where are you Kiki?
No way
But Kiki did it without the teachers knowing
Kiki, what period do you usually go to?
Did you go and do it during lunch time?
Well, we spend more time in the computer lab than in the classroom, so we go to the computer lab from the first period to the eighth period.
Kiki, wow, so you're just going to keep looking at the computer?
Yeah Kiki right
Play computer games during class and go play soccer or sports during lunch.
Oh, right, Kiki
How many people usually play soccer?
Um, we did it like this back then, 9:9?
Is that so?
Is a soccer game usually 9 vs 9?
Isn't that right?
11:11? I think so?
I don't like soccer very much so Kiki
Oh, right, Kiki
Don't you feel pressed for time if you play soccer during lunch?
Yeah, that's right
Then I have to make a deal with the 5th period teacher, Kiki
Kiki and I weren't in high school at that time
Does the teacher give permission?
Yeah, it depends on the teacher, but there were some teachers who allowed it, Kiki.
When you travel, what accommodation route do you consider most important?
Yeah, I definitely stay here! Kiki
The best place to sleep is the one you like the most
But when you travel, aren't the must-see places and such a thing a priority?
right
There is something like that, but isn't that just for Instagram photos?
It's not Kiki
As soon as I get there, I have to take a proof shot for Instagram and capture the scenery with my own eyes!
Well, I like to rest more because healing is more important than the purpose of the trip. Kiki
Kiki: Then, Oppa, you have no intention of going to the guesthouse at all?
right
Kiki doesn't like loud things very much
Kiki just wants to rest alone
We're having a beer party at the guest house and it's so much fun ㅜ
Kiki, I don't even drink alcohol, so I hate drinking alcohol
Actually, I can only drink a little beer!
Kiki, then you'll get drunk before you can enjoy it? Kiki
Kiki no
I'm originally high-tension, so I enjoy it even without drinking alcohol!
Kiki, is this the famous tension where you act like you're drunk without drinking? Kiki
Kiki, everyone is telling me that I've already drunk!
Yeah Kiki but my friends say that too Kiki
Aren't you scared when it thunders, oppa?
Yeah, I'm not really afraid of that kind of thing.
I didn't do that either, but didn't you hit it really hard recently?
Oh right
It thundered really hard during this rainy season Kiki
that's right
That's Chuseok, right?
Isn't that right?
I think it was before that
Nonsan was hit at dawn during Chuseok!
Yeah, Kiki, but isn't it fun when it thunders?
Oh my gosh my heart almost sank!
It's just a little disturbing to sleep, but all the men have to go out and watch Kiki
Kiki, really?
I was so scared my heart was pounding!
Kiki, when there's thunder and lightning, you have to take a picture. Kiki
Have you ever taken a picture of that?
Hmm, I tried but it all failed... ㅠㅠ
Kiki is right
Lightning really does flash and disappear.
That's right
I tried to take a picture when it looked like lightning, but it was so hard ㅠㅠ
Hey, did you see the article I sent you?
Yeah I saw Kiki
It was totally awesome...?
Yeah ㅜㅜ
A man in his 70s killed his wife.
How can you do that?
Living in the real world is scary
that's right,
And then he committed suicide by jumping too, right?
So I don't understand why people like that do that...
I know,
At 70, you're quite old.
I know
What happened that made you do something like that...?
They said they are investigating the circumstances of the incident, so another article will come out tomorrow!
Yeah, I guess so?
I hope it comes out soon, I'm curious ㅠ
The region is said to be Gyeongbuk Yeongju, but it's the first time I've heard of that name!
Kiki, it seems like it's close to Daegu, but it's a little scary because it happened not too far away.
Oh really?
Then do you know about Yongamgyo Bridge?
no...
I don't know much about Daegu, but I don't know much about other areas.
Kiki, a whale? Kiki
I heard he committed suicide by jumping off a car at that lava bridge.
Oh my, why did you do something you'll regret...
It's such a pity
Didn't I tell you about Pfizer's shortcomings last time?
Yeah I told you Kiki
Did you say I could die?
no
That's modern!
Do you know what the downsides of Pfizer are?
no
I'm not sure about that?
What is it?
Even if you get it twice, the effectiveness gradually decreases after two months!
Wow, then isn't it the same whether it's right or not?
There's no reason for that to be the case, right?
Initially, the prevention rate was 93%, but later it dropped to 60%!
Hmm, thank goodness I'm a modernist, Kiki
Kiki I don't know
So the US is getting a booster shot right now!
Yeah, that's right
I heard it will be released in Korea too, 3rd time Kiki
Right now, medical staff and people with jobs related to coronavirus are getting the shot!
Oh, already?
Yeah, we have to hit those people first before we can hit them too.
Yeah, the medical staff probably got it in April!
Well, does this year have to pass if we're going to get to our age anyway?
Kiki: Maybe so?
It doesn't matter to me, oppa, because it's Moderna!
Well, I don't know, if they tell me to get Moderna, I'll have to get it Kiki
Oppa, what kind of cosmetics do you use these days?
Um, cosmetics?
For men, all they need is just skin lotion...?
Even my dad is using an all-in-one!
Kiki, actually I'm using an all-in-one too Kiki
Kiki But all the all-in-one cosmetics smell the same!
Right kitchen kiki
Slightly manly smell Kiki
But I think I only use cosmetics when I meet my girlfriend
Kiki oh no
You have to apply sunscreen too!
So, I feel like I have to put on makeup that I don't want to when I meet my girlfriend because it's a hassle to put on makeup, but my girlfriend keeps telling me to put it on...
My boyfriend even wears Vivi
Wow, Kiki Vivi is a man's pride!
That... no!
She even grooms her eyebrows and applies tint!
Oh my gosh, are you interested in beauty, Kiki, or is it you who orders Kiki?
It's not Kiki
He's been like that from the beginning!
Hmm, I guess you're just interested in beauty. That's interesting, Kiki.
Yeah, you have more cosmetics than me!
Wow Kiki, it's not easy for a man to do that, you're amazing Kiki
How many liters of water do you drink a day, oppa?
Well, I also exercise, so maybe 3-4 liters?
Wow, you drink a lot?
Yeah, right
I just drink it whenever I'm bored, so it's a habit. Kiki
Then oppa, I'll use a bigger water bottle too!
Yeah, I use a water bottle that holds up to 2 liters, but it's a hassle to wash it.
If you drink like that, won't you go to the bathroom often?
I go often Kiki Of course Kiki
It seems like it comes and goes every 10 minutes Kiki
I tried 2 liters and it was about that much Kiki
Drinking water is not a challenge, it's something you have to drink unconditionally because it's good for your health.
But I think 1 liter a day is enough!
Well, if you drink a lot of water, your skin will get better, Kiki
But I tried 2 liters for a few months and it was the same?
Hey Kiki, really?
Then I guess I have to ride it Kiki
I'm smart so I get oily!
I still don't know what intelligence is, Kiki
Oppa, do you also do stocks these days?
no
I don't do stocks, coins, or anything like that.
I heard that a lot of kids in their 20s invest in stocks these days!
Yeah, I've seen a lot of people do it around here, but I've seen a lot of blood Kiki
Kiki, it seems like everything is negative now!
Yeah Kiki These days, parents don't save in savings accounts, but buy stocks. Kiki
In the case of Samsung, there is something called dividends!
Right Kiki
I've never done stocks before so I don't understand why you do it Kiki
Me too Kiki
Someone I know said -6% this time
My friend's main job is trading stocks, and when he loses once, he loses up to 5,000...
Wow, so how much is the most you can get?
Um, the most he earned was 200-300 million?
Is that so?
Wow, wow, you really are wielding money like that?
But I still have more to gain than to lose, Kiki
It's different because I'm a professional Kiki
So, I don't do my main job with stocks.
I guess I'm all shaved?
Kiki, if I did that too, I think I would have lost everything
So I don't think I'll do it Kiki
Oppa, do you watch music shows like Inkigayo?
Well, I saw that kind of thing in the military, but once I got out into society, I didn't see it at all. Kiki
Kiki, which group was your favorite in the army at that time?
Um, when I was in the military, did you know Laboum? They were famous.
Hey, aren't they a group that got popular with the song Imagination Plus?
Yeah, that's right Kiki
It was really huge back then
IU also won once in the military, Kiki
Oh really?
How can you beat IU?
On that Music Bank, they were ranking the artists, and IU got 2nd place and Laboum got 1st place. Kiki
Wow, every time IU releases an album, it's a hit song!?
right
IU's song is a hit every time she releases it, but Laboum's song is a hit every time they release it a few times. Kiki
Wow, but why did they disband now?
I think it's because one of the members got married and stuff.
Oh right
You married a member of FT Island?
Yeah, that's right
He was the most popular, but he got married and that's why he disbanded, right? Kiki
Oh really?
I heard you're living well now that you gave birth to twins!?
Yeah, okay, then
I want to live well like that later too Kiki
Oppa, aren't you interested in things like figures?
Yeah, I'm not really interested in toys, Kiki.
okay?
I want to have a figure of every cartoon I've seen that was fun!?
Well, I don't really have time to put down the figure, I just don't really think about Kiki
The place to put it is to pioneer it.
Don't you know about Moses' miracles?
Oh Kiki, so I have to buy that display case too, but I don't really like Kiki
Kiki, do you know about Attack on Titan?
Yeah I know but I've never seen Kiki
Oh really?
This is also really fun, I recommend it!
Yeah, people around me tell me it's fun to watch, but I can't seem to find the time. Kiki
But this has a lot of cruel scenes, so opinions are divided!
Well, wouldn't it be more fun if there were more cruel things?
Are you saying that the animation is really good? Kiki
Yeah, that's right
This is cannibalism!
Yeah, yeah Kiki, you were just flying around and playing around, you little kid.
It looks fun, Kiki
Yeah Kiki
They're animating that, and the animation is really awesome!
Oh, I'll definitely have to watch it sometime when I have time Kiki
Have you ever tried sushi with toppings on it?
Hey, these days, everything has toppings.
Yubu Sushi is really good
Dude I just tried it and it's delicious!
right
It's like a crab that's going up, Gemty
that's right
I like salmon, bulgogi, eggs, and shrimp!
Wow, the sushi roll has salmon on it.
Oh! And it has raw salmon on it too!
Kiki's daebak salmon tofu sushi is killing two birds with one stone
Kiki, it's so delicious that you put wasabi on it too!
Ah, I really like wasabi, raw wasabi ㅡㅡ
that's right
Fresh wasabi is on the menu!
I'm a real wasabi fanatic, so adding wasabi to sushi is a must
Kiki, huh, you too?
Wasabi is a must for me in my soy sauce!
Kiki ah soy sauce no no~ wasabi yes
Kiki, do you have three nostrils?
Kiki, is it because of sinusitis?
If you eat wasabi, your teeth will be pierced and you will be able to grow
I need to organize my clothes. What should I do?
Yeah, you have to know how to boldly throw away things you don't wear.
But you know that women don't throw anything away, right?
Kiki, if I leave this alone, I think I'll wear it again later
Kiki is right
I have something I brought from Nonsan that I've never worn!
Kiki, I'm wearing the one that number 27 gave me for my birthday last year for the first time this year.
Kiki, I have some clothes for number 27 too.
Kiki, what the heck?
Birthday present~? &gt;
No, that's not it
Clothes that don't fit me
Kiki, what is that? How can you wear number 27?
I had it altered, but it was cut too short.
Oh, this 27 was smaller haha?
of course
Among us, I'm the tallest~
Kiki aha okay~
Acorn friends~!
Kiki, we have to see every centimeter!
Well, you have to give it 0.5 centimeters to get recognition
What do you ride when you travel?
We almost...
When you go on a trip to New Gu...?
Um, family or boyfriend?
What are you riding?
Family is mom's car~
My boyfriend is my boyfriend's car~
Kiki: Then you don't have a car?
Kiki, I don't even have a license.
Kiki ah right
When will the license be released!
Kiki: Ugh... I'll... I'll definitely get it next year, right...?
But if you're not going to buy a car right now, you don't have to get a license.
Oh yeah right
I don't think I need a car right now since I have a commuter car.
Kiki, you have two strong thorns too~
Kiki, even even
If you get a driver's license, you can borrow your boyfriend's car.
Kiki Oh, my sweet boyfriend lent me that?
Yeah, he said he'd lend it to me haha. I don't have a license yet, but I got permission in advance.
Wow your boyfriend is really cute~
Kiki, okay, let me teach you how to drive~
When did you first start working part-time?
When I was 21?
started late
What were you doing when you were 20?
When I was 20...? What did I do...?
Did you just play at home...?
Kiki: Then what did you do with your allowance back then?
It seems like you just received pocket money and lived...?
Wow, I'm trying out different things!
What have you tried? Chinese restaurant~!
that's right
I worked at a Chinese restaurant for a year~
Kiki, I also worked there for a day.
Kiki, that's right
How was it then?
Well, it seems like the boss is doing business as a hobby.
Kiki is right
That boss used to drive a truck
Kiki Oh really?
I guess it was really a hobby, not a main job
You run a second-hand store, right?
Wow, the leisure of the rich
Have you seen the Netflix series DP?
No no, what is DPI?
Catching that escapee?
that's right
It's a story about being in the military!
Oh, what is that?
Is a drama about military life?
But among them, catching deserters comes out!
Deserter Kiki
Ah, it's not an escape, the military calls it a deserter.
Kiki, I did something because you said you were an escapee.
Kiki whatever haha
It's okay if the meaning is understood
Kiki But I asked my brothers about this?
Hey, is this really some kind of position?
Hey, this is a real position, but is this the kind of situation where you desert?
Hey, why are you deserting?
Now, I usually get bullied by my seniors.
Oh no ㅜㅜ
As expected, the seniors are bad&lt;~=
That's why the letter from the heart was created!
Is that a letter from the heart?
Feeling like filing a complaint
Didn't your boyfriend say he's studying something these days?
Yeah, my boyfriend is working on computers and 3D tools.
I know that computer skills are famous, but what is 3D tool?
3D Tool is a design editing program.
I see
What level of computer skills are you preparing for?
Looks like you're preparing for the first-level computer skills test?
Wow, wow! Isn't level 1 incredibly difficult?
Oh, it seems like I only passed the 12th level written test and not the practical test
Kiki, wow, I didn't even get a level 2!
Kiki okay I don't even have Excel Kiki
Kiki, what do you call that PPT?
Hey PPT ITQ? PPT PowerPoint?
Kiki, that's right
ITQ Kiki, this is gone for me too ㅜ
Oh, man, does that have an expiration date?
I also learned Korean and things like that
Yeah ㅜㅜ
They said it's been 3 years, but it's already passed.
Wow, it must have disappeared and still remains haha;
Aren't you going on a family trip?
Yeah, I think I went there when I was a baby.
Me too, but I haven't been to Kiki since elementary school
right
I think you won't be able to go as you get older
Even my dad died while following me ㅜ
Kiki's father is almost like a mountain traveler, I like it
Kiki no
I have to go to every place in that area.
Oh, you're so diligent;
I have to wake up at dawn
Oh, but I have to solve everything in 1 night and 2 days
Kiki Huh where the hell do I have to go to this small town?
Kiki no
Even in Busan, are you kidding me?
Kiki Oh my goodness, how many oceans does Busan have~!
Kiki: That's why I see so many seagulls!
Kiki must smell like the ocean
You must have gone to the aquarium too
Kiki, I think I went to that observatory too!
Oh, I haven't been to the observatory either
How do you guys celebrate your anniversaries?
We didn't take care of it for 3 years!
I'm thinking of taking it for 4 years!
Why didn't you take care of it for 3 years?
I already took care of it once for 3 years
Kiki Oh, I see
I know what you mean~
Kiki haha ^^ I celebrate my birthday every year~
You guys must feel something new~
Kiki, it's your first time in 4 years, so I'm going to take care of it for 4 years.
Kiki, it's already that time,
That's what I'm saying
As I get older, time passes quickly.
When is the 4th anniversary this year?
Our 20th day ~^^
Hmm~ I hate Wednesdays
Oh my goodness, my anniversary is on the 21st~
Wow, really? This is awesome.
It's October for you too~!?
Kiki Of course~
We dated for a week~
Wow how can one day be different than a week?
How old is your fat one?
Fatty six pictures ^^
Cute Age Kiki
It's already like that!?
I know,
My little one is already old enough to talk
Kiki, you know, she's so assertive
Kiki, yeah, she's stubborn. She won't stop until you listen to her.
Kiki, but do you know why he does that?
Are you giving me too much love,^^?
that's right
There is someone who listens to that stubbornness~
Looks like mom ㅡㅡ
I won't listen to your stubbornness
Has Kiki been going to the hospital these days?
Well, I went early this year so I haven't been there yet
The hospital said you're healthy? How is it?
Yeah, my teeth aren't in good condition, so I'm having them pulled out and losing weight.
Wow, you pulled them all out?
Yeah, my teeth are especially bad ㅜㅜ
Don't you like things like fishing?
Oh man, I'm so bored I could die from fishing
Kiki: Indoor fishing spots are all the rage these days!
I don't know
I haven't been there
Can't catch fish
Don't you have a younger cousin?
Young? Well, there are two!
Aren't you going to take them out to play?
But one of them is a middle school student and shy, and the other one is an elementary school student and doesn't listen to me.
I'm going there with my little cousin!
Okay, are your younger siblings having fun?
Dude I love it so much it's going crazy!
Kiki, are you kids good at catching fish with your hands?
Hey, it's mine, hold it yourself.
Kiki, take the sweet fishing bus~
He won an event there and got a box of Shin Ramyun!
Wow, Kiki is a fishing prodigy~ Genius fishing
Are you going to the PC room today?
Oh no no
Kiki watching her boyfriend at home
What games do you play at your boyfriend's house?
My boyfriend also plays Overwatch, a game similar to Kiki's
What character does your boyfriend use often?
My boyfriend does everything, but he mainly plays dealers.
If you're a dealer, what about that sunset character?
Kiki oh right
That character is also a dealer
What was this character's name?
McCree~! This time there was a controversy over the character name Kiki
Oh right Kiki
Why McCree?
McCree is the name of a Blizzard employee who was recently fired due to a sexual harassment controversy.
Huh? Really?
Why is the name McCree?
Kiki was named after the developer on purpose, but that's how it turned out.
Oh my gosh ㅜㅜ Did you really sexually harass me?
Yeah, that's why the company got cut too~
When did you go to Jeju Island?
Kiki when I was in high school?
Math trip?
Oh my gosh, Kiki, you got hit hard that time, right?
Yeah - - The happy face of the cooking teacher who used to call me &quot;Social Science Teacher&quot;
At that time, only me, number 13, and number 6 didn't match Kiki
Kiki, are you serious?
Wow, how did it not fit?
We used to play with red cards Kiki
Kiki Ah me too but as soon as the teacher came I laid down on the floor and got caught
Kiki, you're saying you were pretending to sleep there?
Kiki, you kind of just laid down in the middle
Kiki but we also get caught playing Hwatu Kiki
Kiki is really a dog-eat-dog cooking class Kiki
I deserved to be single
no
Your room is worse so I just keep telling you not to do that Kiki
Kiki ha honestly we would have done the other half too ㅡㅡ
Kiki, come to think of it, it was another classmate who got it early!?
What I'm saying is~
I really should have chased him and fought him
Here, the rain is falling steadily,
Wow, it's so sunny here
How many hours is the difference between there and here?
Kiki, what did you say?
It seems like there's an hour or two difference
Then the sun can rise there!
Kiki oh yeah right
It's so hot here.
Oh really?
Is the sun shining brightly?
Yeah, so I can't even go for a walk.
Kiki, it's raining here so I can't go out ㅜ
Ah honestly, it's so annoying not being able to go out because it's raining
Kiki Ka funny Kiki it's already dark here
Oh really?
It's raining so it's going to get dark quicker
Oh right
Turn off the lights and it's just like a movie theater
I wish I had Kiki
It's so bright in here!
Kiki Fatty needs to go for a walk!? Huh?
Ah no ...
What would you do if your successor was always late by 2-3 minutes?
I think I'll be called by the team leader before I can say anything?
Kiki, but what if the team leader tells you to be careful?
I'll give you some attention, being late is a no-no.
Kiki, there was a writer who was worried about this, and he warned me about it at first!
Yeah, but did you report it as workplace violence?
no
Then the successor apologized and came to work on time for a few days, but that was the last time.
Oh, but isn't it a problem if you keep being late?
that's right
Even the successor's house is only 20 minutes away from the company!
Ah, as expected; the closer you get, the more you realize it's a national roll
Kiki, that's right
But I posted this because I thought it might be weird to keep talking for 2~3 minutes!
No
The company pays you money because it compensates you for the time you worked, so you have to be punctual.
that's right
The company doesn't allow overtime and even lets me leave work 30 minutes early on Fridays!
Wow, this company is great
No matter how much I think about it, being late is an exaggeration
I want to step in as his successor.
Seriously, if it were our company, I would be fired
Russia is on alert for another 4th wave of the pandemic!
Hey, Russia didn't get the vaccine well?
There is even a vaccine made in Russia itself!
Oh; isn't that a low preventive rate?
But it doesn't work because Russian people don't trust Russian products.
Wow, the country can't give trust to its people.
So even if you get vaccinated, you have to go to a neighboring country to get it!
Aang, don't they import things like Pfizer?
Don't you see?
Because it was made from itself!
Oh, oh my, I see;
Uncertified vaccines are a bit unsettling;
therefore
They say there are already a thousand coronavirus deaths here.
Wow, a thousand people come out in one day?
no
The cumulative total is a thousand and the number of confirmed cases is 30,000!
Ah, the total is a thousand.~
Wow there are so many, oh my gosh ㅜㅜ
The vaccination rate is so low that it spreads quickly.
ㅜㅜ Please import something like Pfizer ㅜㅜ
You bleached your hair back then!
Yeah, when you bleached your hair 3 times?
Yeah, that's right
How much did you give me then?
I dyed my hair and it looks like I'm over 20?
Did you get that done at Jochiwon Beauty Salon?
No no
I did it in Daejeon~
Jochiwon is not possible
I saw a flyer saying that Daejeon has a huge discount~
Kiki: Yeah, but even with the discount, it's still expensive;
It's not Kiki
If you did it somewhere else, they would have given you the basic 30?
Kiki, really?
I guess it's because I always look for places that have discounts
Because I paid 350,000 won because I bleached and dyed my hair twice.
Wow, aren't they really scammers...?
It's too expensive, ...?
no
My older sister also did it in Sejong and she paid that much!
Hick Sejong is expensive too ㅡㅡ
Oh but why do you keep putting up with double prices?
Kiki is a regular there so she gets a 20% discount now!
Ah, now?, 20 percent is a bit too much
My fingers have been itching so much lately!
Oh, it itches?
Is it a skin problem? What is the problem?
Yeah, that's right
I think it's either eczema or atopic dermatitis!
Wow, you have atopic dermatitis
You have to be careful about what you eat
Yeah ㅜㅜ
I thought my atopic dermatitis disappeared when I was young ㅜㅜ
ㅜㅜ They say that children and adults also have atopic dermatitis
that's right
When I was young, I couldn't even eat hamburgers as I pleased.
Wow - - If you have atopic dermatitis, you can't even eat things like snacks as you like.
that's right
I can only eat Jjajangmyeon once a month ㅜ
Poor thing ㅜㅜ You can't eat a lot of flour?
that's right
There was too much to cover up
Oh, then what do you eat? Organic fruits and vegetables?
Just a home-cooked meal made by mom Kiki
Kiki, this is so; Mom must have been picky too ㅜㅜ When it came to you,
Kiki, oh my, you've been an unfilial daughter since you were little.
Kiki oh no no
I never got seriously sick when I was young.
Do you know Market Kurly? It's a shopping mall?
Oh, I know. I ordered something there once and it came out frozen.
Isn't it originally frozen? It's refrigerated?
Oh, I remembered
I ordered those bananas, but they came frozen and black
Kiki, huh? Bananas shouldn't be cold, right?
That's why I got a refund because I was so shocked
They are now selling it again for banana shakes Kiki
Kiki, no, just get your money back!
I'll throw away the banana!
For things like bananas, it's better to just go to the supermarket and buy them!
That's right - - The mart bananas were small, so I ordered them from Market Kurly and they were...
Kiki, why does the mart sell monkey bananas?
Just a regular banana?
That Deltintin is big and nice
Kiki, that place is really delicious!
Right Kiki
Sweet Ddang Ddang Ddang is also very big and good
Kiki I like the Stone brand too~
Kiki admit admit
The one without a brand is too small
What songs did we often sing when we went to karaoke?
Us,? Idols 10cm IU Kiki Big Bang?
Oh right
Big Bang can still sing!
Kiki Big Bang is okay, the song is really good,
But I think Big Bang's songs are really good because they don't follow trends!
Yeah, yeah
How did you become so good at writing and composing songs?
Kiki is also G-Dragon!
You're dating a member of Blackpink these days~
Kiki Yeah, that's right -_-
G-Dragon is even in commercials these days
Oh really?
What commercial is it in?
Didn't you see him in the anti-hair loss shampoo commercial with his head shaved?
Kiki, are you talking about T-Tang?
Kiki, that's right Kiki
I just had my hair cut short and straight in front
Kiki, the funny Kiki, that disease that even G-Dragon couldn't avoid,
Kiki I don't really understand why GD is doing commercials Kiki
Wow Kiki is so funny
By the way, isn't GD releasing a new song?
I know
Just filming commercials and wearing clothes - I'm jealous
Are there any comics you enjoy reading these days?
I enjoy Spongebob and Shinchan
I heard a new Spongebob movie came out recently?
Oh really?!
I only watch the old ones, the new ones are brutal
Spongebob's voice actor is the same, but Patrick's voice actor has changed.
Oh my gosh ㅜㅜ Why!?
Is the voice actor not active?
I don't know ㅜㅜ
You know you can't get immersed if the voice actor changes, right?
Yeah, Shinchan's dad changed too, so it was hard to focus for a while.
ㅜㅜ But that person passed away ㅜ
Yeah, I can't help it, he was such a perfect voice actor.
that's right
All of Shin-chan's voice actors are perfect!
Yeah, yeah
Especially Shinchan Kiki
It'll be hard to see if it changes ㅜ
Kiki, but did you know that something changed in the beginning of Crayon Shin-chan?
Oh really?
At first, the voice actor was different from the current voice actor~?!
Oh but it's still very early on so you probably won't know!
Kiki Oh, I see
I like the voice actor now
It's almost time for lunch!
Yeah Kiki
I have to eat lunch after work.
Right Kiki, what do you want for lunch~?
So Kiki, what are you going to have for lunch?
I'm thinking about eating fried tofu sushi right now!
Oh the menu is fine
Should I eat sushi too?
There are a lot of delicious Yubu Sushi available these days! I highly recommend it!
Yubu Sushi then delivery?
Or go to a restaurant?
Delivery? Did you know that these days, they put toppings on sushi?
Wow, there are toppings on the fried tofu sushi?
It's changed a lot
Kiki, right? Salmon and beef and all that!
Okay, Kiki. Isn't that really expensive fried tofu sushi?
Kiki is 12,000 won for 4. Kiki is a jackpot.
The price is reasonable and it’s good. Then pick Yubu Sushi!
Kiki: Right? I'm going to eat something with salmon, beef, and eggs on it!
My mouth is watering
Then I want to eat fried tofu sushi too
Do you know anything about refrigerators?
Refrigerator? No
I don't know very well, but why?~
No, water is leaking from my fridge,
Oh, then I guess I'll have to call the after-sales service center?
But did I change this to the removal mode?
Yeah, I changed it, but is the water flowing?
Oh, and I don't know where this is flowing from
I guess we can't solve it at our level, Kiki
Kiki, there's a groove on that refrigerator handle, it's stuck there.
Kiki, you have to fix it no matter what
Make a reservation quickly
Kiki or should I just switch back to river mode?
I just think there's a problem...?
Aah ㅜㅜ No, this isn't mine ㅜ
Isn't that your house refrigerator? Kiki
No
I'm paying rent now!
Then contact the owner of that house and tell him!
Do you have a car you want to buy?
Of course my goal is a Benz!
You have to work hard to earn money.
Well... the Benz triangle star is so pretty
Kiki, when do you plan on riding!?
10 years later?
After that?
Until then, let's ride the real car Kiki
Kiki, do you have a car that you drive now?
Of course I'm walking now...
Kiki, you're still young~
My two steel legs are full, aren't they?
Kiki, but it's really better to buy a car as late as possible
Really? Kiki
But I like driving so I want to buy it right now ㅠㅠ
Just use something like Socar
Your insurance premiums are no joke
Actually, I'm a total VIP of Socar and Greencar haha
Kiki Oh, can I rent a car in your name?
I rent it with my ID, register as a passenger, and ride around~
What qualifications do you have?
I have a lot of mechanical engineering certifications!
Oh, how many in total do you have?
There are about 7 or 8 of them, do I have to call them all?!
Wow, this is awesome. Sing them one by one~
Is it okay if I shorten it to something simpler?~
Hey, I won't know even if I hear it anyway~
Milling, lathe, mold, overhead crane, etc.
Even if you listen to everything, it'll be difficult Kiki
Yeah, Kiki, but what's the mold?
Should a mold be used to shape iron into something pretty? Kiki
Oh really?
Where can you use something like that?
I'll use it when I get a job...
It's almost like a certificate for show.
Is that so? Kiki
Still, it will come in handy later!
Yeah Kiki, so I just put it aside for now~
Kiki, you did well. When was the last time you got it?
One per year consistently since my second year of high school!
Where did you go to training camp?
Of course I'm from Nonsan Training Center~
Oh, isn't Nonsan so nice?
Hey Nonsan, the facilities are really bad...
Why! Nonsan is such a great place to live!
no
The facilities inside are not good, especially the bathroom
Kiki, really?
I'm okay?
okay?
But I heard that it varies from year to year
Kiki, really?
What regiment were you in?
I'm in the 27th Regiment and I heard they've completely remodeled it?!
Oh really?
I know someone in the 27th Regiment~
okay?
Do you know anyone among the officers of the 27th Regiment?
Kiki Yeah, the boyfriend of the sister I know is now broken up ^^
Oh... What year are you from?
Kiki, I'm a girl,
I got in there by working part-time.
Of course it's a joke
Hey, don't fool me just this once~
Have you taken a test recently?
I just started school and have midterms...
Wow, how are college midterms?
It's just like high school, right?
Kiki study and solve problems
Kiki but your scores are different, like A, B, etc.
Of course, I study with the goal of getting an A+!
Kiki Oh, so far everything is Apple?
I want to do that, but that's not reality...
Kiki, that's fine as long as you don't get the lottery!
There's no such thing as a winning ticket Kiki
Everyone is just doing above average
I heard that if you get hit once you have to take the class again, is that true?
I heard that, but I don't know the details.
I see
As long as it doesn't match the F1, it's fine!
Right, how many credits did you get in college? Haha
Kiki I got a job right away without graduating from college ^^
Wow, that's not a bad idea, is it?
How old are your parents?
There's almost a 30 year age gap between us ㅠㅠ
Oh my god, you're such a late bloomer.
That's right, I'm really late bloomer, so there's a big age gap!
So you're really going to stop raising Kiki?
I have a son who grew up so preciously~ haha
Kiki, I'm the second daughter in our family~
Really? How old are you and your sister?
Kiki, I've been with my sister for exactly 3 years!
3 years won't make that much of a difference, so it'll be comfortable!
Yes, we are like friends!
I'm jealous. I wish I had an older sister or brother. ㅠㅠ
No, it's Kiki
I think it's good to be an only child~
For example?
What do you like about it that makes you think that way?
I'm the second child, so I always wore hand-me-downs when I was little.
Ah Kiki, that could be a drawback...
How did you meet your girlfriend?
I met him by chance when I was traveling abroad haha
Oh really?
Where have you traveled abroad?
I went to Eastern Europe alone, remember?
Oh right
You didn't go alone?
Yeah, I went alone, but coincidentally my girlfriend and I had the same schedule so we went together.
Kiki Oh, both of you, I think the MBI is preceded by an e?
that's right
It starts with e and ends with j, both of us
Kiki Oh, your personalities really suit each other!
I guess so Kiki
So I think we're still on good terms
Kiki said that her girlfriend is two years older than her?
Yeah, my girlfriend and I are 2 years older and younger than each other.
Did you go there after you came back from the military?
It was my last trip before I went into the military ㅠㅠ
Oh, I see
Then when did you start dating your girlfriend?
A year after I went abroad haha
Is your cat hospitalized now?
Yeah Kiki, I just got home after admitting her to the hospital today.
Oh my gosh ㅜㅜ My friend's dog is getting discharged from the hospital today too
Oh my, the cost of hospitalization at an animal hospital is really expensive ㅠㅠ
That's right. Kids definitely need to save up something like a savings account.
I want to save money, but I have absolutely no money right now...
Money comes when you earn it, so put in at least 50,000 won a month.
I guess so Kiki
It's not easy being a cat butler
Kiki is right ㅜㅜ
Our Obok is sick too, so he takes medicine.
Is Oh Bok-i taking her medicine well?
no
Mix it with churu and give it to me!
Oh, my cat is too young to know Churu yet...
Ah, you can't eat it if you're young?
I'm afraid my taste will change ㅠㅠ
But I don't take my medicine well
You have to force yourself to take that pill.
Pills? I got the pills, I have to try them Kiki
I heard you go to the gym these days?
Yeah Kiki
Helen starts working out in a week~
Kiki Oh, wow, are you quitting PT?
Of course Kiki
I don't think I could even try without it.
Kiki is right
I just canceled my membership and wasted my money.
I heard they also teach posture correction and exercise methods?
That's right, posture and breathing are the most important when exercising!
But I think I just did it in a style that filled in the numbers...
Just filling out the number of steps doesn't mean it's exercise.
Really? Then I guess I'll just add 10 more pts
Kiki, if you do it 10 times, you get about 2 weeks?
Yes, I have to use it 10 times a month, so I use it 2-3 times a week as a basic.
Wow, how much does a pity ball cost?
It costs 55,000 won, but people around me say it's more expensive than they thought.
Yeah? It's cheaper than you think.
It starts at 60 thousand won here?
Oh, it's more expensive there
Then I guess I'll just have to stay here...
What games do you play besides PUBG?
Did you know that I'm playing Kart Rider on Nexon these days?
Kiki Oh, are you doing it with your girlfriend?
Yeah, my girlfriend is good at Kart Rider too~
Oh really?
I am the god of item wars~
Item wars are all about luck, no skill required...
Kiki, that's right, but I throw it with good timing
Defending that is useless haha
Kiki, you have to keep flying before that~
Of course, the skill transfer is speed transfer rather than item transfer~
So you're good at drifting?
He's a god in the drift world, he's just so good at it Kiki
Kiki, is your girlfriend doing well too?
He's worse than me, but he still gets in.
Kiki, didn't you say you were doing really well earlier?
I said that because I'm much better at it~
Where do you want to go when Corona is over?
Are you talking about domestic or overseas?
Just say both!
Domestically, I want to go to Jeju Island again, and overseas, I want to go to Japan?~
Japan? Where do you want to go?
I've been to Osaka and Fukuoka, so Tokyo?!
I want to go to Tokyo!
Tokyo? Kiki, have you been anywhere in Japan?
I've been to two places: Osaka and Fukuoka!
Oh, I just went there too
I want to go to Tokyo Disneyland
Wow, I want to go to Disneyland too!
Disneyland is only in Japan and China ㅠㅠ
I'm going to Universal Studios in Osaka!
Oh, I couldn't go at that time because I didn't have money...
Really? But people are awesome
I can only hold 3 all day,
Hey, what is this...
I'll just save money and not go haha
Wow the weather here is really nice!
Yeah? Why is it so cloudy here...
Oh really?
Did you just say Busan?
Yeah, I'm in Busan right now, but the weather here is really bad.
Oh really?
Did you say it was going to rain today?
no
No, it's not, but it's cloudy so I'm worried it might rain Kiki
Isn't it nice when it rains?
Is there anything good about getting your shoes wet...?
Kiki no
On days like that, you should stay at home. Where should you go?
I'm thinking about going out for dinner right now Kiki
Kiki, just order delivery on a day like today!
Is that so?
But the delivery fee is expensive and it's also a hassle to carry an umbrella.
Kiki, order from a place with low delivery fees!
Is that so? I bet your neighborhood is nice and sunny ㅠㅠ
I feel so good right now I want to go for a walk!
I'm jealous... If my neighborhood was like that, I would have already left Kiki
Hey, do elementary school kids smoke these days?
Wow, these days elementary school kids smoke? Kiki
Oh, even openly within the apartment complex,
What the... Are elementary school kids these days fearless?
therefore,
So I paid attention to it and their mom sued them.
Wow, that mom is really...
What is the right thing to pay attention to?
therefore,
The person who wrote this article said that he grabbed the baby by the neck,
Ah, I guess it would be sensitive if there was physical contact ㅠㅠ
therefore
But this elementary school student is under surveillance at the police station or something?
Really? I guess he was just a kid who was a troublemaker haha
It's just that the parents raised the child wrong.
I think so Kiki
Where did you not submit the petition~
Dude, you should know how embarrassing it is,
Smoking openly within the apartment complex,
I guess he hasn't been properly educated at home yet. It's really bad.
So, he said he was also harming other good kids.
That's crossing the line and deserves punishment~
How many cups of coffee do you drink a day?
Me? At least one glass a day is basic.
Oh really?
Do you like coffee?
Yeah I really like coffee
Especially Americano Kiki
Oh, you know what?
Are you saying the price of coffee beans will increase by 70%?
Wow, then the price of coffee will go up too...?
of course,
Now coffee is also becoming a luxury item.
A luxury item...
Coffee is not a luxury, Kiki
They say it's hard to grow this now, and cacao too!
Of course, if the amount of cultivation decreases, the price will naturally rise.
So I really like chocolate ㅜㅜ
Chocolate? I don't like that, so that's a good thing.
Kiki, but did you know that coffee costs 5,000 won?
It's like that these days, so it would be burdensome if it goes up any more.
Kiki is right
Now you can get a drink for just ten thousand won!
Wow, I'll just not drink and save money...
Have you got anything like a piercing?
no
I'm still scared of getting my ears pierced
Oh really?
What about something like a ring?
I have a ring that matches my girlfriend's ring~
Oh, is the ring made of gold?
Is it an 18k gold ring?
I matched them together but I don't remember Kiki
I did it with my boyfriend too, but it didn't even work out.
okay?
Why doesn't it fit?
Does it not fit your hand?
When I wear it, my hands get red and swollenㅜ
I guess the ring and your hand don't match, right?
that's right
But the funny thing is, my boyfriend doesn't even notice!
What? You matched them, so why aren't you wearing a ring? Kiki
Kiki was lost. What do you think?
Are the rascals different?
You lost it?
Then I should have guessed one secretly
Kiki: So I lost it in my second year and haven't heard anything since.
Then just leave it alone~
I'll figure it out haha
If you exercise, what is your diet like?
Of course I'm eating chicken breast Kiki
Kiki, are you sure you can eat chicken jjigae for the rest of your life?
no
I'm going to eat some regular food soon...
Kiki put regular food in slowly
Otherwise your body will be ruined
Right? I haven't eaten regular food so it's so hard.
Kiki, if you don't increase it little by little, you'll get fat
The yo-yo effect is coming Kiki
I want to eat chicken
Kiki, me too
When you talk about chicken, I want to eat it!
I should just order one with the thought of eating chicken healthily.
Kiki, that's right, chicken is protein so it doesn't make you fat~
I'm having a hard time consuming protein intake these days ㅠㅠ
Just mix protein powder with milk and drink.
Yeah? I guess I'll just do that and take care of myself.
Kiki: Yeah, mom's cooking is the best!
Okay, then I'll just pack that rice and eat it!
Where do you buy things like clothes?
Have you ever heard of Musinsa?!
Oh, I'm going to get custom-made couple clothes with the kids this time!
Wow couple clothes?
They sell a lot of couple clothes at Musinsa
no
Matching friend looks with 4 kids!
What did you match it with?
I wonder Kiki
Show me!
Kiki, do you know the brand Who Are You?
Oh I know Kiki
I think that was in Musinsa
Kiki that's right we got our hoodie right here!
Oh it's okay Kiki
I'm looking at pants at Musinsa right now too
Kiki, really?
I have short legs so I can't live there.
Hey, there are a lot of pants that are long enough to fit even if you have short legs?
Kiki no
I'm all grown up, Esdo.
Then there's nothing I can do
I guess I'll have to buy it offline haha
Right, or a short girl shopping mall haha
Ah, you should look carefully in a place like that!
Are there any TV shows you watch these days?
I can't see it very well
But I'm looking for it these days haha
What have you seen before?
Variety show!
Something like Infinite Challenge or Running Man?
Kiki is also Infinite Challenge ㅜㅜ
I still see
Didn't Infinite Challenge end?!
Kiki, now watch it again!
Is that so?
But there are too many episodes of Infinite Challenge
Hey Infinite Challenge, that's a total flop!
Oh Kiki I'm bored so I guess I should watch that
Kiki is right
I personally recommend Myeongsu for 12 years old!
Oh, the title of that episode is Myeongsu is 12 years old?
Hey! You didn't watch Infinite Challenge much?
Yeah, I just saw a few so I don't know anything ㅠㅠ
Kiki, what did you see?
I saw Infinite Challenge, GD is in it
What movie have you seen recently?
I saw a hostage alone recently!
Hostage? Who's in that movie?
Do you know that Hwang Jung-min? Kiki
He's a famous actor.
Oh right
Is that Hwang Jung-min appearing as Hwang Jung-min?
Yeah, it was new because Hwang Jung-min came out as Hwang Jung-min.
Kiki, but I heard opinions on that are divided!?
okay?
I'm totally Hoya! Kiki
The development was also interesting
Kiki, really?
Why were you taken hostage, Kiki?
Of course, money is the goal...
Kiki, how much did the kidnappers ask for?
I asked for it in hundreds of millions, but it was so big I can't remember Kiki
Kiki wow awesome but how did you get out
When the kidnappers were gone, I broke free of the chains and ran away with the hostage girl.
Wow, who is the actress that played that amazing woman?
It's my first time seeing this actor, but he said he was a new actor!
Honey, what are you going to eat with me today?
Um, how about some steamed agujjim boneless? Kiki
Oh, agujjim boneless?
Is it okay?
right
Add flying fish roe rice ball to it
Kiki, wow, what about the amazing fried rice?
Yeah Kiki, here add some rice balls
Kiki, really?
Where is that area?
It's in front of Pyeongtaek Station. Word of mouth has spread that it's good.
Oh really?
Isn't the raw fish restaurant in front of Pyeongtaek Station the best?
That's delicious too, Kiki
It's new
Kiki, who else did you go with besides me?
I ordered delivery alone~
Kiki Oh my, that's a lot of beef, isn't it?
Yeah, so I shared it with my little brother.
Ah, if you eat it with your younger sibling, it's possible~
I'll make it for you when you come over to my house later, Kiki
I finally started doing laundry,
Kiki, you're only doing your laundry now
Kiki ha, I really didn't want to do it,
Oh really?
But why laundry all of a sudden?
Today is the day, ta-da!
Do it at home?
Do you do it at the coin laundry? Kiki
no
I have a washing machine at home, so I'm doing it right now!
Ah, where do you dry your Kiki?
Your house is small
Kiki drying now goes to the laundromat,
Oh, then isn't it expensive to run a dryer?
Well, how much do you think it will be?
It might be around 5000 won ㅜ
I don't know the prices in Seoul
Hey, try lowering the price a little bit!
Hmm, it's 4 thousand won, Kiki
Is that worth running?
Ding~ It's 3,000 won~ Cheap, right?
So turn it!
Wow Kiki is really cheap
Is it a creative economy?
Have you had your car repaired recently, oppa?
Yeah, the battery is dead anyways ㅜ
Oh my gosh what is this?
I think it's old and stuff, Kiki
How often should I replace my battery?
Um, you should change it when your car is sick Kiki
I didn't know either
Kiki, oh my gosh, when I tried to get in, the engine wouldn't start.
Yeah ㅜㅜ That's why I called in a hurry and they said to go to the repair center
Oh my gosh ㅜㅜ So that's why you said I had to change it there?
Yeah, that's right ㅜ
So I got a little bit of money
I see
How much did it cost?
It came out to about 50 Kiki
Ugh, my allowance,
Huh? Why are batteries so expensive?
I don't know either...
Have prices gone up?
I paid 80 thousand won to fix mine.
Wow Kiki did a great job and cheaply
I'm a total replacement
Have you had any part-time work recently, oppa?
Yeah, I'm working a side job these days, Kiki
Oh my! What kind of side job are you secretly doing?
I fold the box...
You know what?
Snack shop skewers
Kiki: Are there any side jobs like that these days?
Of course Kiki
I asked around since I was in the neighborhood.
Kiki Oh my gosh, are you looking for a part-time job?
Yeah, I guess we need someone to fold the Kiki boxes.
Kiki Box So how many do you fold a day?
Fold about 500 pieces and Kiki's work is over, so take a quick look
Kiki Hul, how many hours does it take to fold 500 of them?
Kiki, you can do it all in about 3 hours
Kiki Oh, then what time do you finish?
Okay, I'll finish at ten and go to sleep.
Oh ㅜㅜ Isn't it hard when you do this after work?
It's okay, it's our 7th anniversary soon~ Kiki
Where did you go for training, oppa?
Of course I graduated from Nonsan Training Center Kiki
Kiki, did you know I worked there?
Kiki, why are you working there? ㅜㅜ
It's the Bridge of Lamentation
Kiki's Bridge of Weeping?
What is that?
There is something like that,
Kiki, the place that steals men's tears
Kiki, really?
Is this a place where they train hard?
I think it's going to be hard because it's my first time staying here after enlisting
Kiki, really?
Kids, but it looks like it's hard for you ㅜ
Yeah Kiki, it must be so hard, especially on hot days
Oh my gosh ㅜㅜ When did you go in, oppa?
I went in the summer of 2012 Kiki
Oh my gosh ㅜㅜ You must have had a hard time as soon as you got in ㅜ
I really don't want to go to the military again
Kiki Of course
Who wants to go to the military again!
Yeah, the military was really traumatic for me.
Bro, what are you studying now?
I'm currently preparing for a public corporation ㅜㅜ
Kiki is right
Are you working hard, oppa?
Oh, then~
I sleep 4 hours a day these days
Kiki oh my gosh ㅜㅜ
So that's why you're always tired?
no!
I'm still young~ That's right Kiki
Kiki, are you sure?
You snore all the time?
Ssary~ It's not easy to be a public corporation, so I want to read it once a day.
Kiki's workbook, you bought a lot of it back then, is that it?
Yeah, that's right.
I'm a bookstore VIP Kiki
There's also something called Kiki's Bookstore VIP!?
Yeah, I guess so because I'm a regular, Kiki
I need to stop buying books
Are there no more books to buy?
Yeah, now I just have to go back and look at the books I have several times.
Yeah ㅜㅜ
I'll be able to get it next year!
I know
I want to hurry up and get over the exam life
What is your family structure like?
Me, my brother, mom, dad, you?
I am mom and dad's sister, Kiki
Then you all live together?
Kiki, that's right
Aren't you living with me too?
Yeah, I'm planning to become independent soon.
Oh really?
Where do you plan on going?
I don't want to take the subway near my company ㅜ
But in Seoul, are the housing prices okay?
I'm thinking about living with my younger sibling, Kiki
Oh really?
But my brother's workplace isn't in Seoul!
I'm changing jobs so I'm going to bring Kiki with me
Kiki, are you thinking of moving to Seoul?
Yeah, he said he wants to go to Seoul too, Kiki
Kiki, you failed to go to Seoul last time, but are you really going this time?
Yeah right Kiki
I need to go up to earn more money
How did you meet your current girlfriend, oppa?
I met Kiki when I was working at a buffet.
Oh really?
How old were you at that time?
Oh, it's been a long time, we met when I was 23
Oh really?
So you met right after you were discharged from the military?
yes,
I met you when I was the ugliest ㅜㅠ
Kiki, that's right, oppa, back then he was really ugly,
Oh, I know tooㅜ
But now my girlfriend says I'm pretty
Kiki's girlfriend is really covered in beans,
Bean pods, this is my charm Kiki
Kiki, why does your girlfriend like what part of you?
Well, I guess it's because I listen well
Kiki's brother is quite gentle, isn't he?
What are you talking about?
Where is my rank?
Kiki's brother's ranking?
I'm in the village at the very end of the earth
Oh, don't be like that~
If you want to get married, I have to give in
Does your brother have a puppy now?
Oh right
My name is Merong, Maltese Kiki
Kiki is right
I think Merong is so cute!
Yeah, I took him to a dog park last time. He liked it.
Kiki is right
I have to take it again ㅜㅜ
Then do you want to go together later?
Oh good
Are you the same member that went with you last time?
Yeah Kiki
You can just tell them to bring tofu too.
Kiki tofu?
What kind of paper was he?
He's a Pomeranian Kiki so tofu
Oh right
He's really small and cute!
She's so pretty that she even got offers to be a model.
Kiki, really?
Where did the offer come from?
Kiki said she came from Instagram
They said they'd take an ID photo for me
Oh really?
So you decided to do it?
Yeah, I think I'll take a picture of Kiki's dog
Honey, how was the gym session you did last time?
I quit working out because it was too hard
Oh my gosh ㅜㅜ Didn't you say you were going to get PT?
Yeah, that's right
It was so hard that I ran away
Kiki Oppa, you ran away after going there for a few months!
I know
I think my stamina is really poor Kiki
Kiki is right
Oppa, your stamina is really poor ㅜ
But I worked hard to increase it.
Kiki: So you lost a lot of weight?
Hmm, I think my stomach has sunk in a little bit. Can't you feel it?
Kiki Oh, I see...
That's what went in,
Oh, right
It seems better than before ㅜ
Oh, I see~
That's better~
It's not Kiki
I'll go back when I change jobs. I'm busy now.
Kiki Oki Oki I heard your excuse well~
Oh really~ What am I going to do when I become a fit person later?
Oppa, are you going to the PC room again?
Oh my god, I got caught. When did you see it?
I saw a comment on Instagram saying, &quot;Are you going to a PC room with your friend?&quot;
Oh, I got caught like this, Kiki
I'm going to meet a friend for a bit ㅜ
I'll meet my friend Kiki at the PC room now~
that's right...
I was thinking of playing a few games with him for a bit ㅜ
Put me in a few of those bags.
You just keep farming and you die all the time
Kiki, I often give you bandages and injections instead!
Kiki is a walking loot but he's so cool
Kiki: Well, I helped you a few times!
Kiki, then let's play a game together now.
Kiki, but it takes some time to go to the PC room
Kiki Hmm, can't you play games at home?
I can't do it because I have a laptop.
Oh, then of course that won't work
Come to the shelter
Honey, are you going on a trip with your girlfriend this time?
Yeah, I think I'll go to Busan since it's our 7th anniversary Kiki
Oh my, you've never been to Busan?
Yeah, that's right.
I'm from Gyeonggi-do so I don't go there often
I've been there~ It's so good~
Oh really?
When did you go?
The last time was when I was 13 Kiki
Hey then I don't even remember Kiki n
no
I remember it well~
What should I do if driving in Busan is tough?
Oppa, are you going to Busan by car?
Um, maybe it's better to take a plane?
Where does your brother live now?
I'm in Pyeongtaek right now, but my girlfriend lives in Seoul.
Then I can go to my girlfriend's house and sleep there before I leave!
Yeah Kiki
I think that would be better and faster too
I have to go on a date with my boyfriend today, but the weather is gloomy.
that's right
It's going to rain again this week
Ha, seriously, how long is it going to rain?
They said a typhoon is coming this time
Wow, it's fall, why is there a typhoon?
Okay Kiki
I have goosebumps thinking the typhoon is still there
Kiki, hey, I can't go to work?
Hey, not that much
The coast is deep
Oh, I see ㅜㅜ
Honey, are you going on a business trip to Busan again?
It's a big deal if you go to Yeosu instead of Busan.
Oh, Yeosu is also close to the sea.
Yeah Kiki
So, I guess my business trip will be postponed
Oh, is it really that bad?
Yeah, last time I was in Jeju Island, there was a typhoon.
Oh my gosh, Kiki, what did you do back then?
I just stayed at the hotel and ate something delicious
Honey, did you see the card that came out from Kakao this time?
Oh, what kind of card did you get?
Oppa, do you know the Kakao character Chunsik?
of course
How much I love Chunsik!
Oh, oppa, do you like Chunsik too?
A card with that character drawn on it came out!
Oh my, is that a check or credit?
Oh, I see, it looks like a check card!
Aha, I didn't have a check card!
Oh, oppa, then I can use this!
Yeah, okay
How do I get it issued?
Issuance is now done through Kakao Bank, but it's first-come, first-served basis.
Oh no, I don't think I can do it because my hands are slow.
no
Rather, you will receive the card in the order it was issued starting from 2014!
Oh? I've never made one before ㅠㅠ I'm new
Oh, then I think you'll be pushed back in line
Oh, it's so hard to get a Chunsik like this
This time, a Japanese fighter jet encountered a problem during flight!
Oh really?
What's the problem?
The fighter cover suddenly fell off.
Wow, isn't that a totally dangerous situation?
So if this had really been a real situation, it would have been a big problem!
I think it's a maintenance defect ㅜㅜ
People's lives are at stake.
therefore,
So Japan is in a state of emergency now
I know
Was anyone hurt?
Oh, come to think of it, the person who piloted this fighter jet was probably the most terrified!
Right
How did you overcome gravity...
Kiki, that's right
But what's amazing about this guy is that he landed it safely!
You must have been trained a lot to do that!
So shouldn't this person be given an award!?
I know,
But if I were you, I think I would consider being discharged
that's right
And they said they are looking into why this unfortunate incident occurred in Japan.
right
We need to investigate quickly and do proper maintenance.
Have you ever followed your girlfriend to the hair salon?
Yeah, I was totally taken in, Kiki
Kiki, what did your girlfriend do back then?
My girlfriend is watching and perming my hair
Kiki, was it your brother who did it?
Yeah, but I felt sad because she was like an old lady
Kiki, by any chance, what's the name of that perm?
Baby Perm said he would make Song Joong-ki, but it's just my mom~
What do you think about Kiki's girlfriend? She looks good with you.
My girlfriend is shaking her head too. Is this wrong?
Kiki Yeah, no, did you get a perm?
that's right...
I looked in the mirror and cursed with my eyes ㅜㅜ
Kiki, what did the hairdresser say there?
Oh my, you're so handsome~ Customer~ I can't believe it
Kiki So you asked me to do it again?
no
Just ran away quickly, Kiki
Oppa, do you think you've gotten a lot healthier by working out?
No, I'm losing my health
Huh? Why do I lose my health when I exercise?
Because exercise makes you tired...
By the way, doesn't it feel refreshing after exercising?
Only then do I feel refreshed and my muscle pain hurts
Kiki, I see
Muscle pain, but isn't it about to go away?
Well, every day is new, right? Kiki My Apa
Kiki, you must be working really hard there!?
Yeah, brother, your body feels a bit sick;
Kiki, you're amazing. Come to think of it, you're younger than your brother, aren't you?
I think so...
Still, he's older than me
Kiki, I see
But I think your skin has gotten better.
That's because you sweat and lose oil.
Kiki's so funny Kiki how many months old is it now?
It's been about 3 months. Kiki's resolution is 3 months.
Where do you buy things like clothes, oppa?
I often buy sake at the shrine
Wow, I also bought clothes at Musinsa this time!
Oh, what clothes did you buy?
I matched my clothes with my friends~
Because it's fall, there are a lot of hoodies and man-to-man shirts.
Oh right
I bought a hoodie~
Where did you buy all the Kiki brand?
Am I Lacoste?
Hey, do you know that brand?
Ah, crocodile~ I know, I know Kiki
Oh right Kiki
I bought it from that crocodile brand!
Good job Kiki
Is that on sale these days?
Well, when I saw it, it was 90,000 won, but they were selling it for 78,000 won!
I got it really cheap
That's too expensive Kiki
that's right
I bought it because there was a 20% discount coupon for Musinsa!
How do I get that coupon?
Oppa, there's something I've been watching a lot lately!
I'm watching Gaetmaeul Chachacha these days
I heard Shin Min-a is going to be in it?
Yeah, that's right
My ideal type Shin Min-a
Kiki, can I tell my girlfriend about this?
Shh, it's a secret between us Kiki is so pretty
Kiki's Laughing Show - Who is the male lead?
Kim Seon-ho appears and he is handsome too
Oh right
Kim Seon-ho has been really popular lately!
Yeah Kiki
Kim Seon-ho's worth is no joke these days
Oh really?
I only saw Kim Seon-ho in 100 Days My Prince!
Oh, what drama is that? Kiki
This is a drama starring EXO D.O. and Nam Ji-hyun!
Aha I don't know because I haven't seen Kiki ㅠ
Check that out too, it's really fun!
I'll try to watch it on YouTube later Kiki
I'm planning to watch a movie, can you recommend some?
I heard that the voice that came out recently is fun
Voice? Who is that?
I don't know either, but it's number 1 in popularity these days
Oh really?
Is this the new one that came out recently?
Yeah yeah Kiki I think so tooㅜ
There are no movies to watch
Is that all you have to see these days?
Yeah, that's right, Kiki
Or maybe venom would be fun too
Are you talking about Venom 2!?
Yeah right Kiki
This is totally my style.
Kiki Are the same people appearing again?
I guess so?
Watch the trailer, I don't know much ㅜㅜ
That's right
I have to take my boyfriend to see it!
Age~
Yeah, since they said Kiki is coming out in 4D, go see it somewhere with a good screen.
Kiki Oh Night
You absolutely have to see Podi!
I also wanted to go there with my girlfriend.
A movie date after a long time~
I'm so hungry I'm dying
Why? You haven't eaten yet?
Yeah, there's a place I want to eat, but it's not open yet.
Huh? How delicious is it that you don't want to eat lunch and go? Kiki
First of all, I've never eaten it before!
Huh? What is it? What do they sell there?
Oppa, do you know what a nightingale is?
Octopus, tripe, and shrimp!
I've heard of Kiki, but I've never eaten Kiki.
Right? I'm going to try this because the reviews are good!
Well, I don't eat seafood so I don't want to eat it Kiki
Oh, then do you eat tripe?
Yeah, the tripe is really delicious, Kiki
But I haven't eaten it once since I started working out
Kiki, wow, what kind of fun are you living for!
Okay Kiki
I don't know what I'm living for these days, Kiki
Kiki, let's go eat some tripe, I'll buy you some!
Oh no Kiki, you're losing muscle mass Kiki
If you eat that, you'll get scolded by PT teacher ㅠㅠ
Don't you want to live in an apartment, oppa?
Yeah, not really?
I think a house is more comfortable than an apartment.
really?
Is your brother's family home a house?
Yeah, it's a house, and it has a yard, so you can fight with people in an apartment.
I also have a house Kiki
But I want to live in an apartment!
The house is more comfortable, and I like sharing side dishes with my neighbors.
But places that don't do that don't do that either!
Well, life is hard, so people have to rely on each other to survive, Kiki.
I think apartments would be inconvenient to recycle
Why aren't recycling centers well-organized?
Yeah, but if you want to throw it away, you have to go all the way down to the first floor, and it's annoying.
Then you can live on the first floor of the apartment~
Yeah? Then wouldn't it be better to just live in a house...? Kiki
Kiki's house has a lot of bugs!
Isn't that how it is for you?
Oh, my house is on the second floor because the first floor is a garage and storage space. Kiki
But even if it's the second floor, don't a lot of bugs come in?
Well my mom hates bugs so she's almost like a Sesco Kiki
When did you get your driver's license, oppa?
I got it right when I turned 20 and was selected as a driver in the military. Kiki
Oh really? Kiki
Then I'll drive well!
Well, I'm not very good at it, but I'm good at finding broken things Kiki
Oh really?
Oppa, can you fix it?
Um, just the very basic stuff?
Would the driver be able to do that level of repairs?
okay?
I send my car to the factory if it hurts even a little bit
Yeah Kiki but that's the best Kiki
It's best to leave it to a professional rather than trying to fix it yourself and making it worse Kiki
Kiki, didn't your teacher scold you when you first started driving?
Well, I got scolded at first, but the more I did it, the more Kiki fell asleep next to me.
I learned while getting hit by the teacher with an umbrella
Kiki, I learned it in the military while getting hit with a water bottle. Kiki
Hey Kiki, who hit you like that, Senior?
I hit my seniors and executives, I hit everyone.
Oh my gosh ㅜㅜ What did I do so wrong that I hit someone!
There's no point in hitting people in the military, Kiki
What are your bosses like at work?
Well, they are all nice people, but they are all young for their age.
Oh really?
What is the age range?
Well, it's similar to regular office workers.
The manager is in his 40s or 50s, and the section chief is in his late 30s. Kiki
I see
Are you the youngest?
no
I have a friend who is younger than me, Kiki
Oh, are you the person who came in as your successor?
Yeah Kiki, but I can't really scold her because she's a woman ㅠㅠ
When did that woman join the company?
It's been about two months since you joined the company, right?
Kiki, you can't do much right now
Since it's my first time, I need you to teach me well!
Hmm, I guess I should explain it well.
But since I have an optimistic personality, it's hard for me Kiki
The first button is the most important
It seems like the kids change depending on what their senior does!
Hey, kids these days are so scary. If you treat them well, they'll bite you. Kiki
Kiki, why are you trying to bite me when I'm doing such a good job for you?
Well, these days most kids are like that, but I don't know the details, Kiki
How did you get into driving, oppa?
I don't know?
I just kept nagging at home to join the military, so I just went in whenever I wanted, and I ended up getting the driver's license.
Looking at the DP, if you were a chef outside, you would have been given a cook's license or something like that?
Those are people who didn't have a position to begin with, but drivers apply to go, so Kiki
I see
What kind of car did your brother usually drive?
I've pulled 5 ton trucks, 2.5 ton trucks, everything Kiki
So, do I have to drag everything manually?
Of course it has to be manual
The only car that can carry tall people is Kiki
Then, don't you need a large vehicle license to drive that car?
no
You don't need a large one Kiki
But you need to have a trailer license
So you became a driver because you had that license before joining the military?
Um, no?
Kiki, I'll let you have it because you need it in the military.
Oh, there's something good like that?
amazing!
Yeah, there are a lot of good drivers
If you drive a bus in the military, they will give you a large license in society.
I want to try driving a big bus!
Oh, I'd like to try that too
Kiki, that looks like a lot of fun
Oppa, what kind of academy did you go to when you were young?
Well, I went to private tutoring classes like English and Math, Kiki.
Oh, isn't private tutoring expensive?
Ah, it's just private tutoring, it's the same as an academy Kiki
But isn't it almost a one-on-one class?
No no
Just gather everyone together and teach them together
Should I divide it by grade?
I had math tutoring, and my mom said she gave me 350,000 won at the time.
Yeah, Kiki, I think I gave you about 300,000 won.
But I like the teacher so much that I still keep in touch with him and meet him often.
Oh wow, you had private tutoring when you were in high school?
Yeah, I went to that teacher from 4th grade to 3rd grade, Kiki.
Wow, wow, Kiki, you've really known each other for a long time?
Yeah, right, you're so funny and you're such a nice person, I really like you Kiki
Teacher Kiki, how old are you now?
I don't know the exact age, but he's the same age as Park Myeong-su.
Huh? Kiki, then you're almost 50?
Yeah, I guess it was around that much?
But he looks like he's in his 30s
Aren't you going on a family trip?
Yeah, we've never been to anything like that since we were kids, Kiki.
We don't go because our travel styles are different from my dad's
Kiki, we're all individual players, so it seems like no one has ever asked us to go.
We followed dad's schedule and got a torn calf Kiki
Oh, Kiki, your father must be traveling a lot, Kiki.
My dad is much worse than me!
Still, you must have a lot of stamina, Kiki
Kiki, seeing that your father is physically stronger than you
My dad has to see the sunrise in any area he goes to.
Kiki, adults always have that kind of thing Kiki
That's right Kiki
But the problem is that we all have to see it together.
Ah ㅠㅠ My family is a gangster so I only go to see the people I want to see
I envy you Kiki
If that's the case, shouldn't we meet somewhere at a certain time?
Um, not really?
Just put a message in the group chat asking if anyone wants to go see the sunrise, and if there's no reply, I'll just go by myself
Kiki, are you being too respectful of other people's privacy?
Is that so Kiki?
Kiki is the type that just likes ganples
Do you want to get married quickly, oppa?
Yeah, if I could do it right now, I'd like to do it right now
Oppa, do any of your friends go?
Yeah, there are a few people here and there are a few more who will go.
Are you all close friends?
Yeah, we've all been friends for over 10 years, Kiki.
I'm also visiting a friend next year. How much would be a good amount to give as a congratulatory gift?
I think if it's old friends, it's more than 20 Kiki
But I have four close friends and we decided to give each of them 1 million won!
Oh, you're really strong?
I don't do that even with my 20 year old friend Kiki
But that includes housewarming gifts, congratulatory money, and bridal shower expenses!
Kiki, cash is better than material things, Kiki
But this guy said he wanted to buy a dryer!
Yeah, I guess I can buy it with the money I got, Kiki
But that's all debt, Kiki
It's not Kiki
We're all working hard to collect them!
So the person who received it has to give you a million won when you get married too, Kiki
That's debt Kiki
Have you ever been to the zoo, oppa?
Yeah, I've been there a few times with my girlfriend before. Kiki
Oh, so you went to Everland Safari?
Ahn Kiki
It's just a park in Daegu, Kiki
Is there really a zoo in Daegu?
Rather than a zoo, it's just a large park with lots of animals lol
Is that a zoo?
Is that the place where there are things like peacocks, deer, and camels?
Yeah, yeah, there's elephants and tigers too Kiki
Wow, then it's not a park, it's a real zoo?
That's true, but what park is it called? Kiki
Kiki: Then it's just called a park and it's a zoo!
Yeah Kiki, right, right, that's right Kiki
It was so amazing to go to the zoo Kiki
Yeah, but don't you feel a little sorry when you see what's inside?
Oh, really?
Isn't it a pity that they are living more comfortably?
When I look at it, it looks like you're stressed out in that small space ㅜㅜ
You could think of it that way
I look comfortable and nice, Kiki
Have you ever tried climbing, oppa?
Yeah, I just did it as a joke with my friends when I was little, but I've never done it professionally. Kiki
Oh really?
Are there any places to climb in Daegu?
There used to be a park where you could climb, but I don't know if there is one now.
So, is this a place that has professional equipment?
No, there's no such thing as Kiki
Kiki, it's just a mattress on the floor.
Wow, isn't that too dangerous?
Anyway, it's okay because you can't climb much without equipment
I did that for a long time and it gave me blisters on my hands and it was no joke ㅜ
Oh, if you climb, your grip strength must be amazing Kiki
You should try judo too Kiki
Yeah, that's right
But climbing isn't just an exercise that relies on hand strength!
Oh, is that right?
Kiki, it's not just about getting there by force
no
Climbing becomes a true full body workout!
Well, it would be fun if you did it professionally Kiki
Thrilling and Kiki
If you do this, you'll get spots on your back and thighs.
Oh, I can handle it because I learn it every day Kiki
Do you know Oppa Jjangkangpo? Kiki arcade
Is that really cool?
Is this your first time hearing about it? Hmm
Don't you know the one among those arcade machines that plays rock-paper-scissors?
When men go to the arcade, they only play Tekken Kiki
These types of arcade machines are often found in front of stationery stores!?
I only played the wrestling game machine in front of the stationery store Kiki
Kiki Hul Kiki Daegu doesn't have a game console like this?
Um, Jjangkangpo? I don't think even our kids know, but is there such a thing?
If you win at this arcade game and rock-paper-scissors, you get money and Kiki
Oh Kiki, so you were interested in gambling since you were young? Kiki
of course
This comes out at least 1 and up to 27!
Oh Kiki, then it feels like a slightly smaller Gangwon Land Kiki
Kiki is right
From here, I grew my dream!
Hey Kiki, go to Kangwon Land once. You have potential. Kiki.
Kiki, I have to go and hit the jackpot!
If you hit the jackpot later, let me know Kiki Banthing...! Haha
Oppa, do you know a place called Gunsan?
Yeah, I know, isn't Gunsan Park Myeong-su's hometown?
Oh, Kiki oppa, are you by any chance a fan of Park Myeong-su?
Ahn Kiki
I'm more of an Infinite Challenge fan than a Park Myeong-su fan.
Kiki, there's a place called Railroad Village here?
Yeah yeah Kiki, what's so funny about that?
Here is the Jjangkangpo I was talking about!
Kiki, do you have to go all the way to Gunsan to do that? Kiki
If I do it there, can I go to Kangwon Land too? Kiki
no
There you can go on a trip to the railroad town and have fun at other places too!
People who originally lived in Gyeongsang Province did not travel to Gyeongsang Province.
Kiki, is it in Gunsan, Chungcheongnam-do?
Oh...? Really?
Wasn't it Gunsan, Gyeongbuk...?
I was wrong Kiki
No Kiki
This is the area above Nonsan.
Ah Kiki, why did I know it was Gyeongsang-do... Kiki
That's so funny Kiki
Isn't that because there is a region called Gunsan in Gyeongsang-do?
Is that so...? That's strange
Why did I know Gyeongsang-do? Kiki, ah...! Kiki
Do you like rainy days, oppa?
no
I hate it the most
It gets humid when it rains
But isn't a rainy weekend morning nice?
Um, no?
The laundry I hung out to dry didn't dry and it smelled ㅠㅠ
That's why I love using a dryer!
Oh, the dryer is nice, but if you don't clean it often, it starts to smell. Kiki
There's a laundromat nearby, so I go there and use it!
Ah, the laundromat is nice, Kiki
But it costs money
But isn't 3,000 won a week okay?
Yeah, that's okay
But sometimes, don't blankets get more expensive when you wash them?
Yeah Kiki
But doesn't it get cleaner than doing laundry at home?
Yeah, I feel that way, Kiki
I don't know if it's cleaner, but it feels cleaner Kiki
First of all, the drum in our house doesn't even wash the blanket.
Oh, it's a drum washing machine.
We are the stones Kiki
But I also have to go to the laundromat and wash the blanket.
If you wash your blankets with a Kiki tongs, you can wash them easily!
But there's no place like you, so I think the laundromat is more convenient Kiki
Wow, there was a guy who died fighting with his friends?
Yeah, I saw that article too, really -_- lol
Wow, people are wondering if this was intentional or an accident?
Hmm, but if it was an accident, you would have found out right away if you killed and dropped it...?
It must have been an accident while drinking, right?
Yeah, but the punishment should be very severe.
Oh my gosh ㅜㅜ How did we end up fighting ㅜ
This damn alcohol is the problem, it's the problem, huh...
They're investigating whether this dead kid fell off on his own during the fight or was pushed by his opponent!
But is the investigation important when someone is dead?
In the end, he died and deserves to be punished.
No
This is the most important thing to the other person, their life depends on it!
I guess so?!
If it's an accident, you should be punished.
Our country's laws are too weak
I hope a proper investigation is conducted!
I hope they properly investigate and reveal the truth.
Wow, if 3 people drink 6 bottles, we'll all really get drunk!
Yeah, 2 bottles per person is enough to get you drunk.
Wow, a Japanese university professor made a really absurd statement?
Isn't that totally true?
I don't know why those guys are like that
Seriously, this is probably the worst nonsense of the 21st century!
I admit, people like that really need to be beaten up.
The claim that Korean comfort women were sex slaves is a fantasy?
Hey Kiki, what kind of fantasy is that?
The dog is eating grass, for sure!
Kiki just says no without providing any direct evidence and turns a blind eye to it
Wouldn't that be mentally unstable?
Who hit you Kiki
But I heard that young Japanese people are signing a petition to oust this professor!
Yeah, you're doing great, Kiki.
I wonder if it will be enough to get kicked out
I don't know, but I heard that an anti-discrimination group led by Japanese college students filed a petition!
Yeah yeah so Kiki
The person who made that remark needs to be scolded properly to come to his senses.
Without any evidence ㅡㅡ
But isn't Waseda University a very famous Japanese university?
Hmm, I don't know the details about that.
As far as I know, it's a very famous place, but this professor is the one who spread such nonsense!?
That professor is going to get kicked out of there Kiki
You ruined all the images Kiki
Have you ever waxed, oppa?
no
I've never done it before, but I'd like to try it sometime later Kiki
Oppa, do you have a lot of beard?
no
I do it once every three days?
Oh, so you don't have much of a beard?
It's not that much, but it's not that little either, right?
So which area would you like to get waxed on?
I wanted to receive the whole body Kiki cleanly
Kiki Oh Kiki Should I give you about 500,000 won for that?
Oh, is it that expensive?
Still, I'll try to get it later when I have time
Oh, because men are hairy!
Is that so Kiki?
But if you receive it, it will be clean and good Kiki
Have you ever received it?
Yeah, I got my arms and legs done too and it was fine!
My friend said he was really sick because he didn't have much hair.
Hey, I can just use a depilatory cream!
Wow, I'm a little jealous of that ㅠㅠ
When I have time, I should get my whole body checked Kiki
Brother, have you ever had surgery?
Yeah, I've never had surgery before. How about you?
I've never had surgery, but I've had procedures done!
Um, is the procedure a bit like plastic surgery?
no
I cut my hand while handling a knife and it's now paralyzed!
Ah Kiki, how bad must your stomach have been that you had to go to the hospital and get treatment?
Didn't we make cucumber kimchi during our class?
Oh, Oisobak, I'm suddenly hungry Kiki
I had to dig a cross shape inside, but I ended up cutting my hand while doing that!
Oh my, that must have hurt a lot ㅠㅠ
It's not like it's a scar right now?
Yeah, the injured area is so exquisite that it's hard to tell!
Oh, that's good, Kiki
When I was in elementary school, I was making a water rocket, and the junior sitting behind me scratched his wrist with a knife and it bled a lot.
Oh my, isn't that attempted murder? Kiki
no
My junior's wrist Kiki
He accidentally cut himself while cutting a plastic bottle and cut an artery.
Oh my gosh ㅜㅜ So that's why I didn't have time to hear things like that when I was in elementary school!
I guess so?
It's too dangerous to do it with a knife ㅠㅠ
I just ordered food from Baemin!
Ah, Kiki said he was going to eat nakgopsae
What did you order?
No, no
I ordered acorn jelly~
Ah Kiki, you're eating dinner earlier than expected?!
Then, do you eat late-night snacks too?
no
This is my first meal!
Well, you'll probably be hungry late at night, right?)
It's okay, I've become used to eating one meal a day~
Kiki, is this an unintentional intermittent fasting diet? Kiki
Yeah Kiki
This is what happens when you live alone ㅜ
That's right. If you live alone, you order delivery more than you cook.
Kiki: That's right. Since I only eat one meal, I eat properly!
Oh, you're good at cooking, huh?
Can you make things like soybean paste stew?
no
It meant that I don't order instant food~
Kiki, just a simple fried egg? Kiki
Kiki no
I mostly order Korean food for delivery!
Hmm Kiki, you're a delivery person after all Kiki
But I still eat out sometimes
Oppa, I'm going to eat while watching Infinite Challenge. Can you recommend some fun episodes?
Well, if it's Infinite Challenge, I also enjoyed watching Infinite Company. What do you think?
Oh, is that the episode with G-Dragon?
Yeah, G-Dragon was in it and it was a musical and it was fun. Kiki
Yeah Kiki
Oppa, do you know Mr. Kim Kyung-sik, the author of Don Quixote? Kiki
Oh Kiki, that's a total rip off Kiki
Yeah Kiki
Even at that time, it was a really unfamiliar word!
Kiki oh right Kiki
Written by Kiki
It was so funny, I want to see it again
I have to watch it since my brother told me about it!
Yeah, every episode of Infinite Challenge was really fun.
It was so funny that the donation was good and Kiki
Oh, I don't think I've seen that!
That was a special feature for a few hundred times, and if you get the question right, you have to donate, Kiki
Then Yoo Jae-seok must have donated the least!
Ah, Yoo Jae-suk didn't donate because he's an MC, Kiki
Hal Kiki didn't donate at all?
Yeah, yeah, only the members donate and Yoo Jae-suk is MC Kiki
Have you seen the new movie that came out recently?
Well, I don't really watch movies, so I don't know. What movie?
Oppa, then you don't watch movies and stuff like that?
Yeah, I don't really watch it because I'm not really interested.
Oh, I see. There's a movie about voice phishing coming out this time!
Oh, who's coming out?
Is it fun? Kiki
Oppa, do you happen to know Byun Yo-han and Kim Moo-yeol?
Well, I know Byun Yo-han, but I don't know who Kim Mu-yeol is.
Oh really?
They're both famous actors!
Oh really?
The only fever I know is Hanho fever Kiki
Kiki Ah Kiki Han Ho-yeol isn't that the name of the play?
Yeah Kiki, that's right. Han Ho-yeol Kiki from Kiki Dip is cute.
Kiki is so cute
These two actors are in it and it's really fun!
Oh really?
I should go see it later when I have time.
They say sinkholes are fun too
That's already been in for a long time ㅜ
Oh, wasn't that a recent movie called Sinkhole?
Has it been that long?
What food do you hate the most?
Me food, I don't really like tomatoes
Is it okay if you just don't put tomatoes in it?
Yeah, I like tomato sauce, but I hate raw tomatoes.
Do you drink tomato juice then?
no,
I don't eat tomato ice cream or drink juice.
Wow! So you're only going to eat spaghetti?
Yeah, I like spaghetti and ketchup, Kiki.
Kiki: Oh right, there was ketchup too?
Kiki Woong I especially like mixing ketchup with ramen
Ah, so bibindan means eating it like bibim noodles?
This is how you boil ramen, drain the noodles, and mix them with ketchup to eat.
Oh Kiki, what does that taste like,
You should try it too. It's really delicious.
no
I'm fine, I'll decline
Kiki, people don't really know, but it's so sweet
Are you good at cooking at home?
Well, no,
Sometimes, when someone comes over to play, right?
Kiki I don't even go to the kitchen in my house
Kiki's cooking is best when delivered~ ^^
Kiki then~
Are you just going to take the ice cream from the fridge?
Yeah, yeah, what about the storage notice for drinks or ice cream?
Kiki: Right, you use the microwave to heat up something?
Kiki, right, the microwave is good
I can't even wash the air fryer because it's a hassle.
When I say I cook, it's just boiling ramen or frying eggs?
Oh, even frying eggs requires a lot of courage
Kiki, if oil splashes on you, your arm will get burned ㅜ
ㅡㅡ That's right, if oil splatters, it's hot and it's hard to wash the dishes~
Kiki and our mom said, &quot;Hey, come out!&quot; and mom did everything~
Kiki, okay, Mom~ How do I do this? Like this? If I do this, you'll come
Kiki Someone was trying to make scrambled eggs, so I called my mom and asked if I could put water in the frying pan. Kiki
Kiki, what the hell, there's water in the frying pan Kiki
Are you steaming eggs in a frying pan?
Do you know the train called SRT?
Yeah, I've heard of it, but I guess I've never ridden it?
I also said this is the fastest train?
Wow, this train is faster than KTX?
Wow, it only takes 2 hours to get from Seoul to Busan!
Wow, this is awesome
How did you discover such technology?
Instead, there is no place to stand in the middle!
Ah, it goes on nonstop! Oh good.
Yeah right Kiki
So I'm going to try it out!
Oh oh oh but then the price will be very expensive?
Oh, when I saw it, it was about ten thousand won more expensive than KTX!
Oh my gosh - KTX is so expensive that I can't ride it often ㅜㅜ
Yeah ㅜㅜ
From Seoul to Busan, KTX costs 50,000 won.
Wow, seriously, for 10,000 won, you can eat two delicious meals.
Kiki admits and SRT has its own app!
Oh, there's a separate SRT app besides Korail.
Is there a part-time job you've had that was the hardest?
I'm a part-timer who picks wasong in the fields
Kiki Wasong Is that the wasong that YouTube mukbang creators eat?
Kiki Yeah Kiki That grass looks like a succulent Wasung
Where did you get that part-time job Kiki?
Kiki Yeah, my dad's friend is working in a wasong field, and my grandmother took me there.
Oh, did you do it in Nonsan by any chance?
Yeah, that's right.
Wake up early in the morning, soak up all the sunlight,
Wow, Kiki Wasong can't be raised in a house?
Yeah, I just grew it in a dirt field where the sunlight shines down on it.
Kiki: Then, should I dig it up with a hoe?
no,
I planted it,
Because of that squatting thing,
Don't you even give me a Kiki's Squat Chair?
Yeah, I put a chair on my butt and walk around with it on, and I planted it.
Kiki, a friend with no flesh on his butt, sitting on it,
Kiki it was so hard
Farming part-time job is extreme
None of your cousins have a younger sibling in the military?
There's a kid who came back
Kiki, I was discharged from the military a while ago
So he's 23 now?
Oh no!
22 years old!
I think you went as soon as you turned 20?
Oh, I heard he got pushed back, but he got lucky and got there quickly?
Yeah, I guess so
I heard he went right away
That's awesome. What was your position?
Where was the sleeping quarters placed?
Uh, I don't know,
I remember the deployment was towards Gyeonggi-do.
If it's Gyeonggi-do, it's almost Paju, right?
Right,? I think you went to Paju,?
My older brother was also in Paju
My cousin also went to Paju!
Kiki Wow, a lot of people are being transferred to Paju~
Kiki, that's right
But this guy came out for a bit
Huh? What are you talking about? You're on vacation?
no
They told me to go to a big hospital for a blood test!
Oh my; is that the kind of thing that a doctor does?
Which teacher did you like best when you were a student?
I,? I didn't have a teacher that was that good.
My academy teacher when I was in middle school ^^
Kiki, if it was our school, I would admit it, I really hated it all.
Kiki, right?
Our school only has a first-year teacher and a baker?
Kiki, are you the baking teacher?
Secretly, they were on our side!
It was a bit of a tsundere style!
Yeah Kiki
You took our side and stuff!
When we were about to go eat, I told Kiki to go behind my sisters.
Yeah Kiki
And they take care of all the volunteer work for you.
Kiki is right ㅜㅜ
Even though he was a bit of a grump, if you think about it, he was a good teacher.
Kiki is right
That's why you say so!
Right? I didn't know when my first-year teacher was my homeroom teacher, but I think it was good.
Yeah ㅜㅜ
That teacher has retired now, right?
Oh my gosh, really ㅜㅜ?
Wow, wasn't he one of the real powers?
Yeah Kiki
My high school 3rd year teacher and I were members.
Kiki, right? What kind of party? What kind of party are you with? Kiki
The first grade teacher was strong and good
Have you ever fought with your mom?
Yeah, just to the point where we argue occasionally, right?
I grew up being beaten by my mother when I was young.
Wow, that wasn't a fight, it was just a one-sided fight, right?
Hey, I guess I'll have to talk back later when my head grows bigger~
Kiki, there's no point in talking back to a mom like this.
But I nag my mom so much that she gets annoyed?
Kiki Ah, I'm also the king of nagging my mom these days Kiki
Kiki, you too?
I guess my daughter can't help it~
Yeah, my daughter takes good care of me and nags me a lot, haha.
Kiki, that's right, my parents said that their daughter is the only one left around them~
That's right, these days, daughters are the trend~ ^^
Kiki is right
My sister and I have been fighting lately, so I guess I'm the one who's fighting
Kiki, what the heck, your family only has two daughters.
Oh, good luck with your children.
Yeah, that's right. You have an older brother, right?
Yeah we have one son and one daughter haha
What are you guys going to do for this anniversary?
We were supposed to take a picture, but we're busy this month so we'll probably take it next month
Oh my, a selfie camera?
That's trendy these days!
That can't be done with Photoshop ㅡㅡ
I want to take a picture or something like that
no
Please correct that!
Oh really?
Are the writers here?
We take the pictures as we please, and the author chooses the ones we want!
Ah, so we were the only ones taking the pictures and the photographer did the editing and developing!
Yeah, that's right!
If you ask me to correct it then please do so!
I like the correction to be strong, huh,
Kiki, how do you want to make it tough?
Um, ^^ I wish you would make my face a little tighter
Kiki, what are you doing, dilate your pupils and shrink your face to the point of disappearing?
A must for a slim face!
Bright eyes are a must! A narrow nose is a must!
Hey, if you make your face like that, won't only your neck show?
Kiki Ana ㅜㅜ Seriously, I need to lose weight or I'm screwed
Have you ever had your fat dog hospitalized?
Anning,
Fatty didn't have any particular surgery because the extraction was the biggest surgery.
How much did the extraction cost?
Well, at that time, I got an X-ray, blood test, and scaling done and it came to 240,000 won.
Aren't you going to do the whole thing?
Oh, no, not all of them, I just took out the two rotten ones!
I see. Cat teeth removal costs are expensive.
How much is it?
Did you also have Oh Bok-i extracted?
no
I looked into it and it starts at 2 million won.
Huh? One Kiki tooth? 200?
Wow, is it too much?
no
The cat has to go to the whole bathroom ㅜ
Oing? You can't just pick one?
If you want to pick one, you have to pick all of them?
That's not it, but anesthesia is absolutely necessary ㅜ
Yeah, that's right, puppies are put under general anesthesia too!
Just scale it
But anesthesia for cats is expensive ㅜ
Oh, it seems like anesthesia for cats is expensive.
Have you ever watched a soccer game?
Oh, when was it? I saw it on a projector at school when I was in middle school.
Oh really?
Who were you with then?
At that time, the Olympics and World Cup were in full swing, so it was really hot.
Oh really?
Maybe it was the Olympics then?
Was it the Rio Olympics?
Was it Park Ji-Sung at that time?
I don't remember
That's right, Park Ji-Sung played the game and retired at that time.
Oh, I see. Rio was the last game?
I guess that's what I thought?
Ah ㅜㅜ I miss you, Ji Sung
Heung-Min Son is famous these days~
Kiki, stop it~ My son Kiki
Are your hands in Manchester?
Kiki, did you transfer this time? Maybe?
Oh my, where?
Did you say you went to Tottenham?
Oh right
Shouldn't it have been there from the beginning?
Ah, the rumors of transfer keep going around!
Did you often go to the arcade across the street from us?
Kiki, didial?!
I used to go there often, Kiki
It's so much fun to watch!
I also went to punch a lot with the kids!
Kiki, that's right
There are punches and kicks in front.
Yeah Kiki I've always been last ㅜ
Me too me too ^^
I get basic score every time I punch Kiki
Kiki, there was a really strong friend among our kids ^^
Oh right, that number 24,
A friend who gets better grades than most guys
We were quiet when he got the highest score.
Kiki, yeah, that guy is honestly beyond my reach in terms of strength ㅜㅜ;
From the start, it's game over for us~
Kiki, don't be discouraged. We can play other games instead.
Kiki I saw that dinosaur blowing up a balloon? That was good!
Kiki, what is that? Bubble bubble?
What do you do with a joystick?
Oh right
I've beaten that boss!
Wow; did you catch the boss too?
Joystick talent is amazing
I want to go to Boracay. Have you been there?
Wow, Boracay is in Vietnam?
No no, I won't go either ㅜㅜ
Oh, no, it's probably an island in the Philippines, right?
Kiki a Glukuna
Boracay is an island with really pretty water, right?
Yeah ㅜㅜ
I want to go there and enjoy the activities!
Oh my god, you're just diving and riding a snowboard?
That's right, you can even see sea turtles!
Is the turtle just watching?
Can't you get off?
What if I touch it for no reason and get bitten?
Oh my, even turtles bite ㅜㅜ
Boracay would be fun,
Then turtles are omnivores Kiki
Ah, it's an omnivore, so it bites people's hands too.
Don't look down on me
Kiki, then it's a nutritious and delicious piece of meat.
Kiki this boracay
But wasn't there a controversy about trash in the past?
That's right, it was closed for a while because people were throwing away too much trash.
Ah, it's okay now and it's open again!
Did you know there was thunder and lightning this morning?
Wow, I don't know, we didn't even get a drop of rain!
It's raining heavily here in Seoul right now ㅜ
Wow, as expected, Seoul is a tough place to live in~
Doesn't it rain this often in Nonsan or Chungnam?
Yeah, that's right, that's right,
It rained moderately though ㅜㅜ
Yeah Kiki, I've been here all week ㅜ
Kiki and the river depth...? Anyway, it must have gotten a little higher
I don't know, now that the rain stops, I'm going to go to the Han River!
Oh~ The Han River is nice~
The water is deep so you have to be careful when you go.
Kiki, I'm scared to go that close!
Kiki, I won't let you get that close anyway.
Yeah Kiki
I should just go and eat some tanghurino!
Wow, if I eat tang-hulu, it feels like all my teeth will fall out.
It's not Kiki
Well-made tteokbokki doesn't stick to teeth!
Oh really?
Please introduce me to tang-hoo-ru next time too
Oh my god, 3 people died in a one-room apartment in Gumi.
Oh my god, why!?
The three of them committed suicide?
It hasn't been revealed yet why he died, but there are no signs of murder.
D D Is it like a family?
Or friends? Club?
no
If it was a family, it would have said that it was a family death, but it didn't say that!
Aang, isn't that something that people who commit suicide do together?
Oh, is that so?
But they said that people in their 10s to 30s gathered together
That's why; the age groups in those gatherings are diverse.
Ah, why are you a teenager? ㅜㅜ
Oh my gosh ㅜㅜ So 3 people died and one person dropped out now ㅜ
ㄷ ㄷ He dropped out. When he wakes up, we'll know the whole story
The person who dropped out is that teenager!
Ah, it seems that teenagers are still alive because they have young blood.
This guy was found after his teenage friend reported that he couldn't contact him!
ㅜㅜ Oh my god, what happened to my family and why did my friend report me?
So I guess it sent some kind of signal!
ㅜㅜ Oh my, this is really suicide,
Why is there such a gathering in 2021!
Do you know the woman who is the greatest con artist in America, Jobs?
Female jobs?
What is that?
Is this your first time hearing about it?
This woman, who was called Woman Jobs, developed something incredible!
Looking at the fact that he's called Jobs, I guess he must have created something IT-related.
Well, they said that one drop of blood can diagnose 200 different diseases!
Hikki, you pulled off a scam by linking medicine and Haiti;
Kiki: That was a huge hit, because at the time there were only 16 types that could be identified with a single drop of blood!
Oh my, so he was called Jobs because he was innovative and revolutionary;
That's right, the company this woman started was worth tens of trillions!
Kiki, what about the shareholders who have tens of trillions?
But the medical community said that what this person was claiming was completely unreasonable, so I looked into it and it turned out to be true.
Ah, I guess they caught it in the medical field;
How could you commit such a fraud when you have such a big heart?
But if you're not an expert, you probably don't know anything
ㅜㅜ Well, that's true,
Did you get caught by the police?
Get life imprisonment
He's been in a legal battle since 2012 and is now in prison.
Kiki Ou has been at the workshop for a long time
I guess that's because you earned a lot of money
Do you like things like watches?
clock?
Well, I have an Apple Watch, so I'm not really interested.
You have an Apple Watch
When did you buy it?
Kiki, I got a present around summer~!
Oh, who would you call your boyfriend~?
To my boyfriend~^^ hahaha
I got it as a birthday present~!
Oh~ But isn't your birthday in the fall?
Yeah, I got it in advance~
It's okay to receive it in advance, right?
Kiki, that's right, but what's the use of having that?
Oh, it's pretty and the clock is digital so it's easy to see the time.
Those kids just changed the lines and decorated it nicely!?
Kiki yeah right right
It seems nice that you can change the line!
Kiki, what design are you wearing now?
Am I just comfortable?
Neither leather nor metal, that genius, huh?
Kiki what is that
Is it just a basic item?
Hmm, that's right, that's how it feels
The buckle is perfect for convenience!
What are you eating these days?
I take Omega 3, skin nutrients, probiotics, lutein, and vitamin C!
Do you take collagen as a skin nutrient?
Yeah, that's right
It's collagen, but it's a cat that takes pills
Do you think that would definitely work?
Well, I don't know for sure, but it seems like my skin gets rough when I stop using it.
Kiki I'll just eat the pig's feet deliciously
Kiki, okay. Eating raw food is the best way to absorb nutrients ^^
Kiki, I tried collagen when I was 20!
How did you eat it?
It's almost like powder and jelly
I also have one in pill form and one in jelly form!
Oh, if it's a pill, it's the one with pink and white combination!
Oh I was a little lavender!
Oh, this is my first time seeing this.
I ate a lot of powder too
Whether it's powder, medicine, or jelly, they're all the same to me.
Kiki, really?
Actually, it's good for your skin to drink a lot of water.
Have you bought anything online recently?
I got body butter and perfume from Carrot yesterday Tikki
Body butter?
What is that?
Is it lotion?
It has a thicker texture than body lotion, but it's super moisturizing in the winter!
Is your face or body dry overall?
My body is so dry that I can't live without lotion in the winter and spring.
Kiki Oh, I see
I feel like I'm going to get acne if I use that butter!
Kiki Oh my, I'm jealous. I hate putting on lotion.
Then what about the rush scrub? Try that!
Ooh, that's good for exfoliating?
Oh but Rush is so expensive~!
It moisturizes while removing it at the same time!
Oh really?
Sigh, but first, I'll use up all the body lotion I have.
Kiki is right but I don't go to Rush often either
Right - - Rush is too expensive
I use spray every day,
That's also true, I'm introverted so I don't get along with people there.
Kiki, you're so popular, sis and brothers, Kiki is the kindest
Do you like upbeat music or sad music?
When I work, I listen to exciting music, and when I rest, I listen to ballads~
Then, have you heard of the new songs that idols release these days?
Hmm, Espa? I don't really listen to new songs, ^^,
Kiki I also listened to aespa. Isn't it good?
I didn't like it when I just listened to the song, but when I watched the music video, it was so pretty that I started liking it
That's right, they're monsters born from Yoo Young-jin~
Kiki, isn't she really pretty?
I was surprised
Yeah ㅜㅜ
All the kids are so pretty ㅜ
Oh my, that snake guy, especially his jaw is so straight~
Are you talking about Kiki Karina?
It's a perfect V-line!
So the eyes are big and ㄷ ㄷ
Seriously, what a heavenly face
Yeah, that guy and I, Jang Won-young are really so pretty ㅜ
Ah, yeah yeah, that little kid has a face the size of a fist and is as tall as a giraffe.
Right, your legs would probably be as long as my ribs?
Kiki, you are truly a great person
Completed Youth
Did you try Shinchan again today?
no,
I didn't see you today,
I couldn't watch TV ㅜㅜ~
I saw it on Facebook~
Wow, what did you see?!
You saw Shinchan on Facebook!?
I saw the episode where I went to Daege Nara's unlimited refill Kiki
Kiki, what is that?
Just a regular version? Or a movie version?
It was just a regular episode, but it was really funny
Kiki, really? That's funny
I watched a little bit of the movie on Facebook
I've only seen the Kiki movie in the bathhouse!
I recently watched the movie on TV and it was fun ㅜㅜ
When you say TV, are you talking about Tooniverse?
Yeah, that's right. There are a lot of cartoon programs on Tooniverse!
Kiki, I think I know what it is.
A 26 year old is watching a cartoon program~
Kiki's heart is like that of a 26-year-old, but she's still 16.
Kiki then~
It's not a sin to watch cartoons~
Right right
Crayon Shin-chan, you have to get older to see it to understand the emotion
Sister, what's for lunch at work today?
I decided to eat salad today!
Oh my, they even serve salad at work!?
You can choose between a lunch box or a salad Kiki
Wow, you work for a good company, sis!?
no
The salad is always the same ㅠㅠ
Hey Kiki, what kind of salad is coming out?
I ordered chicken breast salad today haha
Of course, salad has to have chicken in it~
What should I eat?
What do you usually come up with?
I'm sick of packed lunches ㅠㅠ
We have to go out and find our own food ㅠㅠ
Wow, that would be a job Kiki
It's raining, so I have to go out...?
Oh no ㅠㅠ So I'm thinking of going to the convenience store!
I like convenience stores these days because I want to eat something at the convenience store.
Do you know about the red bean flat noodles that are coming out these days?
To eat that!
Wow I haven't tried that yet Kiki
Is it delicious?
Is this your first time trying it?
Is your sister living alone now?
Yeah, I've been living alone for a long time ㅠㅠ
Oh really?
How many years has it been?
It's been over 5 years
I think it's a bit old Kiki
Oh really?
Isn't it uncomfortable to live alone?
It's not comfortable to live alone
The only other thing that's a bit inconvenient is rice!
Right, isn't it uncomfortable to always eat alone? ㅜㅜ
No it's okay
I'm getting used to eating alone haha
so do i
Sister, are you going to cook and eat?
no
Almost order delivery!
It costs a lot of money to make it
Yeah Kiki
I'm also using Baemin now~
Do you like Baemin the best?
Coupang Eats also came out
Oh right, but I use Baemin more often!
What about your sister?
I also use Baemin often haha
Sister, I'm using Baemin VIP right now~
Wow Kiki I'm not that bad this is no joke
What does your sister ride to work?
I walk to Kiki, 5 minutes walk away
Wow, you've had a successful life, sis?
no
Still it's hard ㅠㅠ Kiki
Kiki: Then you don't have a car, do you?
Yeah, yeah, I can't save money because it's a waste of money~
Kiki Me too
I take the subway to work ㅜ
I hate the subway so much. It was hell when I lived in Seoul...
Kiki, have you ever lived in Seoul?
Yeah, I've lived in Seoul! Of course.
Really? When were you in Seoul, Unnie?
I was there two years ago and four years ago too!
You came and went twice?
Aren't you having a hard time?
Yeah, I was there that year
To Yongin and Jamsil!
Oh, I see ㅜㅜ
Are you in Nonsan now?
no
Now, other regions besides Nonsan!
Sister, have you ever worked part-time?
Yeah, I've done a lot of part-time jobs.
Oh really?
What kind of part-time job have you had?
I've tried it in restaurants, marts, wedding halls, etc.
Wow, you really did a lot, sis. Wasn't it hard?
Yeah, it's fun and hard at the same time.
Oh really?
Which part-time job was the most fun?
Um, I'm at the mart?
Scanning barcodes was fun
Kiki Hehe, don't you like that beeping sound!?
Yeah, it's kind of fun and it feels good to touch money...
Kiki, how many hours a day did you work part-time?
Doesn't it take almost half a day?
So what was the hourly wage then?
7690 won... I don't remember
I think it was around 7,000 won
Oh, then it would have been 7540 won! Kiki
It's a memory, that amount,
Oh right
I think that was it, I remember Kiki
Sister, do you have a younger brother or older brother?
Yeah, I have a younger brother and a younger sister, but I don't have an older brother!
I see. How old is your little brother now?
My younger brother is now twenty years old, Gotsuriya Kiki
Oh really?
Are you going to be a senior now?
no
I'm an adult now that I'm twenty haha
Soon, Gotsuriya
Oh, I see, now I'm going to get a letter from the military haha
It's still a long way off
Kiki, I think you're going straight to the military
Kiki: Then I guess I should go get the new sword now!?
It's still far away, Kiki
I haven't even graduated yet ㅜㅜ
What would you do if your younger brother went to the military?
It seems like it'll be a bit exciting, but it'll probably be lonely only at first...
Wow, you're really close with your younger siblings?
Yeah, I'm the type that lives without any worries, Kiki
Oh, I see ㅜㅜ
What does your brother say about the military?
Kiki, you said you were going to the Marines or the Special Forces
Sister, are the straps of your bag long?
Did you graduate from college?
Yeah I graduated from college Kiki
Wow, your bag strap is really long, sis.

But if you watch a lot like this, time goes by quickly haha
Yeah Kiki
If I work today, when do I rest?
I rest every Wednesday and have Sunday as my day off!
Then I'll take a day off tomorrow!
Let's stay here, sister!
Yeah, I have the day off tomorrow and the day after, so I have to endure it, I have to endure it...

Wow, wow, physical therapy is a place you have to really study hard to get into!?
No Kiki
Not necessarily
Does your sister have a boyfriend now?
Yeah I have a boyfriend
Oh~ How long has it been now~?
It's been over 2 years. It seems like a long time since we last met...
Wow, it's really been a long time~!
How did you meet!?
When I was having a college reunion, my older sister called her close older brothers and one of them!
Wow, is this what they mean by self-satisfaction!?
Yes, we met naturally, Kiki
Like flowing water
I'm jealous of Kiki ㅜㅜ
How old is your boyfriend?
Kiki is 3 years older than me
I see. What is your boyfriend doing now?
My boyfriend is a firefighter! He's a civil servant

Kiki oh my gosh I think that's really going to happen
My cat asks all the time ^^
Oh, there's a cat?
How many? Kiki
Kiki, we only have one kid that we raise inside and three kids that we feed!
Wow but why do you always ask Kiki ㅠㅠ

I was going to go running but it started to rain.
Kiki, were you going to run outside?
Yeah, I feel like I'm sweating a lot when I walk around the park.
Oh Kiki, are you going to the city park by any chance?
no
I don't live in Nonsan haha
So where does your sister live now?
I'm in Daejeon right now.
I see!
Do you like the park in Yuseong or the park in Nonsan?
The park in Yuseong is much bigger and better.
Wow, I want to go to Yuseong Park too!
How many minutes do you run?
I think I'll run about 3km. Kiki 30 minutes? No.
Huh!? You're saying 3 kilos is possible!?
Go quickly and just look straight ahead and you'll be there in no time Kiki
Wow, that's awesome. I should try running with my sister later!
I walk and run repeatedly so it's easy ㅜ Kiki
Does your sister like playing games?
No ㅜㅜ
I don't like games
Really? You don't even play mobile games?
Yeah, my phone is clean~
Wow, Kiki, your boyfriend doesn't like playing games either?
The dog was playing with a bag, but he was playing with a bag and a mobile phone.
As expected, Beg Kiki
But Beg Mobile came out too!?
Yeah, that's what they said. They said a lot.
Oh my, Kiki, you just saw what you were doing?
Yeah, I saw it from the side and I thought it was funny
Kiki, but was your boyfriend having fun with that?
Yeah, it's fun. I guess surviving is fun...
Did you know that if you get first place in Kiki's bag, you get to eat chicken?
Oh really?
Are they just giving out chicken there?
Yeah~ That's right~
Ask your boyfriend~
I bet you ate a lot of chicken without telling your sister~?
Kiki, you always eat chicken
I guess that's why
Sister, you went on a trip last week!?
Yeah, that's right, it was a vacation...
Why, but what happened when this happened!?
I hate going to work today Kiki
Ahh Kiki, that's right, I admit that
Where have you been?
I went to Yeosu for 2 days and 1 night haha
Wow, you saw the night sea in Yeosu too, right?
Of course, Yeosu night sea is a must Kiki
Kiki, you went to the romantic pojangmacha there too, right!?
Yeah but the romantic pocha is below expectations
Kiki Huh!? Why are so many stores closed these days because of the coronavirus?!?
no
There were a lot of people
But it was more expensive than I thought and the taste was just okay...
Oh my gosh ㅜㅜ I really liked it, but has the taste changed now? ㅜㅜ
Oh really?
Forty thousand won is the basic amount for one thing.
Wow, a latte was around 30,000 won, but it's gotten a lot more expensive?
Yeah, I guess so then ㅠㅠ Kiki is expensive
Sister, is it still raining a lot in Daejeon?
Yeah, I think it's over now
Thank goodness there were a lot of people yesterday, right?
I think there were a lot of people at dawn
Oh really?
Didn't you come home yesterday?
Yeah, you're not here yet?
Oh, I see. There have been a lot of people to Seoul.
Oh really?
You've been to Seoul a lot, but you haven't been to Yeosu...
Oh right, you're really lucky, sister!
The local government is coming down now!
How long will it rain?
It doesn't feel like fall
Yeah ㅜㅜ I've been coming to Seoul since last week
Oh really? Aren't you cold? How is it?
Ha, it seems like it's going to be cold.
no
It's just hot and humid,
Yeah, it's humid
A musty smell in the laundry
That's right, that's why I need a dryer!
Yeah, I also have rhinitis and need a dryer haha
Sister, do you know the Netflix series called Squid Game?
Yeah, I did that before Kiki
Sister, do you know who made the dalgona that appears there?
no
Is there someone who makes dalgona?
Oh, that's right, there's a Dalgona craftsman! Kiki
Are you Korean?
Who made this haha
Oh, that's right. He used to make and sell dalgona, and now his business is doing really well. Kiki
Oh really?
I used to eat that a lot when I was little
Oh, sister too? Me too Kiki
But I heard that this CEO has a huge problem these days ㅜㅜ
Wow, what are your worries, Kiki, I think your business will go well
Yeah, business is going well, but YouTubers and African BJs are filming videos as they please!
Oh my, why are you doing that without even asking permission? Kiki -_-
The boss says it can't be done, but they keep doing it.
The boss's face is also shown ㅜㅜ
Why is that? You have to get permission to take pictures like that...
That's why I even told you not to take pictures!
Don't listen to me!
People are selfish and only care about their own benefit...ㅠ
Sister, there was a famous company in the US called Theranos. Do you know about this company?
no
What kind of company is it?
Let me see Kiki
no
You don't have to look, Kiki
By the way, have you seen the article that says you can detect all diseases with just one drop of blood?
Oh yeah I just saw it
The greatest conman? Kiki, what is that?
Oh, right!
There were tons of articles about how Theranos' diagnostic kits could diagnose all kinds of diseases!
Was it like that?
I just know that she is a female representative...
Oh, that woman was really famous in the beginning as the female Jobs?
Yeah, I think I saw that article
But what about Jobs ㅠㅜ Kiki
Kiki, so at first, the company's value was like 470 trillion, but now it's 0 won.
Wow, 470 trillion is a jackpot?
If I had invested in stocks, it would have gone bust...
Kiki If you keep having it, you'll be in big trouble Kiki
That's right, you should sell it when it's expensive
Wow but it's 0 won ㅜㅜ
Kiki's corporate value is worthless
This conman finally ended up in court, and guess what she said?
You're a scammer, Kiki
Is that what happens when you make money?
Kiki turned out to be a scammer, but he said he wasn't a scammer.
Everyone is like that, the criminals don't know Kiki
Does your sister use perfume often?
Yeah I like soft perfumes
I see. Do you like to smell perfume yourself?
Yeah, that's right, either try it yourself or use one that you receive as a gift!
Kiki Hall me too
Which brand do you like personally?
I just want Lanvin and Dior, which are cheap?
Was Dior a cheap place!?
Isn't it expensive!?
It's kind of cheap haha
It's not expensive!
Kiki, right? Kiki, I'm in Bulgaria now!?
I'm using the one I got as a gift. Do you know the brand?
Oh I know, the first one I wrote was Bvlgari Kiki Purple
Oh really?
What's creepy is that I just saw the color and it's purple Kiki
Purple, that smells good, Kiki, so gentle
Kiki Oh, that's right!
Sister, you don't like fresh perfumes?
Yeah, I don't like that
It's almost all pink
I like calm things so Kiki
Oh, right, Kiki
I think I've decided on a birthday present for Unnie Oki!
Oh thank you in advance
Still far away... Kiki
Sister, did you get all your shots this time?
What kind of injection?
Vaccine or flu?
vaccine!?
Did you get everything right up to the second time?
Yeah, of course
We are old!
Oh, that's right, you're a medical professional!
When did you do it!?
It's been a while since I've been here, maybe July or June ㅜㅜ
Oh, what happened to you then, Unnie?
I got Pfizer because I'm under 30!
Is Pfizer suitable for people under 30?
Then does Moderna also have a standard?
Wasn't Moderna the next one to come out after Pfizer?
Oh, I see!
So, what did you feel after you got hit, sister?
I thought I was going to die after the second shot...
Wow, the second one is really strong.
Were you in a lot of pain?
Yeah, I was in so much pain at dawn that I thought I was going to die.
Oh my gosh ㅠㅠ I must have called in sick the next day ㅠ
no
Fortunately, the next day was a day off...
Sister, do you use Naver Shopping often?
Yeah, I use Naver Pay a lot too!
Oh, I also use Pay a lot, but don't I get a lot of points?
Yeah, it actually became quite a lot
That's so cool when you order from Baemin
Kiki Wow, you could even order Baemin with that!?
Yeah I can use my PayPal rewards when I pay haha
Kiki, wow, awesome, unnie, what did you buy and eat?
I eat various things from Baemin
What should I eat today...
Kiki, today I personally recommend the whole pork belly kimchi stew~
Wow that looks delicious Kiki
Kiki, I just saw a mukbang YouTuber eating and it looks really delicious ㅠㅠ
But even if you say it's a whole pork belly, there's nothing really real about it...
Kiki, that's right, it'll all come out cut off haha
I really want to come out and eat it whole ㅠㅠ
That's right ㅠ
Oh right, Baemin gave me a discount coupon until 5pm, but I forgot!
Is there something like that?
Delivery is the best these days haha
Sister, do you know the picky eater named Haetnim?
Yeah I know
Funny, eat well Kiki
Yes, that's the person eating the food I saw earlier haha
Do you watch this person's broadcast?
I only check it out occasionally when it comes up on Facebook.
Kiki, really?
Did you know that this person also appears on cable TV?
Where? I think I saw it when I came out with that Harry.
That's right, it's a program with Shin Dong-yup and Park Na-rae!
Oh yeah I think I saw it there too Kiki
Right, did you see them eating there!?
no
I didn't see it there very well
Are you eating there too?
Kiki, that's right Kiki
Kiki ate delicious food in front of the panelists, causing the panelists to feel distressed
Oh really, then it would be really painful
Kiki, that's right, now if you guess the lyrics correctly, the panelists can eat then!
Oh, I watch that sometimes when I have nothing else to watch haha
Kiki me too
But Hye-ri quit ㅜ
Taeyeon isn't coming out? Taeyeon
Sister, what movie have you seen recently?
I recently watched the Black Window Marvel movie
Black windows?
When did that movie come out?
It's been a few months, Kiki
I know who it is
Whale,? But I haven't seen Marvel Kiki
I don't know about anything else, but I absolutely have to buy Marvel with my own money...
Kiki, seriously, that's really fun, but did you see it in 4D?
I saw it that way, of course it was like that haha
Kiki, I see ㅠㅠ
Did you see it with your boyfriend?
Yeah, I was scared so I watched it with you
Oh, isn't it true that Kiki's boyfriend likes Marvel movies!?
We've changed. I'll guide you through the Marvel universe...
Kiki Oh wow, so your boyfriend just joined Marvel?
Yeah, that's right, my brother wasn't that good
Kiki, then we'll watch Marvel together every weekend?
No, I've already seen it all Kiki
I'm planning on eating gopchang today. Aren't you jealous?
Oh, are you Jacob? Kiki
Would you like to eat grilled tripe?
Oh, my boyfriend bought me some tripe~
Wow I'm jealous Kiki
Fried rice with tripe
That's right~ It's even my favorite tripe restaurant!
Oh my gosh, Kiki, you eat tripe for lunch?
no
I'm planning to go there in the late afternoon!
Aha Kiki, I think it'll be around dinner time today?
That's right, my boyfriend is coming home after 3 o'clock!
What haven't you eaten until then?
Ah, roughly what should I use to make it~
Aren't you going to eat natto again?
Kiki, my natto got hurt, it's so painful ㅜ
Oh my gosh, Kiki, you should have eaten quickly, Kabi
No, I mean I ate it sparingly because the expiration date was long.
Oh, how long is the shelf life?
Oppa, aren't you thinking of living alone?
I want to branch out too, but the house prices are expensive
Oh, I admit it, but isn't your company a small to medium-sized company?
Yeah... my bones really hurt ㅠㅠ
If you go to a public corporation, you will be separated
Are public corporations easy to get loans from?
It's not easy to save money Kiki
Because the salary is high
Kiki: Oh, I see. When you were in a small business, you had a loan. What was it?
Youth loan and such, but public corporations are not included
That's right, I'm working at a small business now, so I can get it!
Oh, I see
Should I pull it out in advance...?
So, it would be better to quit working at a small or medium-sized company and run away to a public corporation!
Kiki Yeah, I'm thinking about it, but I think a two-room apartment would be goodㅜ
Kiki, I'm going to live alone, isn't a two-room apartment a bit big?
I should tell my girlfriend to come and live too~^^
Kiki Oh, I think my girlfriend would really like it
I have to say that I have a house, Kiki
Oppa, what kind of car is it?
I drive an Avante Hybrid!
Oh really?
When did you buy your car, oppa?
Oh, I picked it out as a birthday present last year Kiki
Is this a gift from oppa to oppa?
That's right... I bought it with my own money ㅜㅜ
The expenses were too high
Kiki, how many months is the car installment for that car?
I made it 2 years, so pay it off quickly Kiki
Wow, then how much do you spend per month?
Um, over 50?...
Haha it's a secret from my girlfriend
Kiki, why do you buy things with your brother's money?
no
I got a new car because I thought I was going to get in trouble
Kiki, what's wrong? It's not like your girlfriend manages the money~
Still, Kiki will probably get scolded for spending too much
Kiki, didn't you buy it knowing you'd get in trouble?
That's right, a man's curiosity can't be resisted lol
Oppa, what was your first part-time job?
I think I've tried solo serving
Oh really?
How old were you when you did it?
Well I've been working since I was 19 Kiki
Wow, Kiki, isn't Gosam the age to take the CSAT?
Yeah I gave up early and made Kiki money
Oh, right, Kiki
I got a job early!
Where did you get a job last year?
I work at a buffet restaurant in Pyeongtaek.
Oh my, Kiki, that must have been hard. Did you cook it?
Or serving?
Kiki I was in the form part~
Oh Kiki, you're really good at cooking.
Then~ I'll cook Jjapaghetti well
Can you make Jjapaguri too?
Of course~
I'm a pro at making Jjapaguri~
Wow, please make me one next time Kiki
Oppa, how was your military life? Was it good?
I think I have some memories
Oh really?
What memories do you have?
I was in the mountains and I heard screams every night.
Kiki, is this true?
But it's true that there is a really big wild boar in the mountains
Yeah right Kiki
That scream is exactly the sound of a deer~
Oh my gosh ㅜㅜ Why is the deer crying?
They say that the sound of a goral's cry is originally like a scream.
Oh really?
Then, you must have heard that sound every time you were on duty or something.
I was surprised when I heard it during my Jamjji days, but now it's just like that
Oh really?
But how many hours do you work on duty?
Um, I stand all day Kiki 24 hours
Oh really?
Then isn't it difficult?
I'm sleepy, but the manager takes good care of me so it's really great
Oh really?
thank god
How is the cycle?
You have to stand once a week and take turns doing it
What kind of qualifications do you have, oppa?
I have a rather unusual certificate, hehe...
Really? What kind of certification is it?
Joju Functionalist Kiki is making cocktails
Oh really?
Oppa, are you good at drinking?
no
Can't drink
But I like cocktails
Kiki, really?
What kind of questions came out on the test?
Does Kiki know about Junbuck Tequila Sunrise Kahlua Milk?
Oh, I think I know what Kahlua Milk is
It's chocolate milk, right?
Yeah right Kiki
A bit like chocolate coffee milk
Oh right
They said it was delicious!? Really?
Yeah it's delicious Kiki
I liked it the most while taking the class
Oh my gosh, Kiki, if oppa could drink well, he could have become a bartender?
no
I don't like that, I just want to enjoy it as a hobby
Kiki Oh, have you ever made one for your girlfriend?
Um, I'll make it for you when I go on a trip next time!
What is the age difference between you and your brother?
I am four years old China Kiki
you?
Kiki I'm 3 years older than my sister!
Your brother is your younger brother, right?
Yeah, that's right, I wish I had a younger sister too.
Kiki, why don't you two share clothes if you're younger brothers?
Well, her and I have completely opposite styles.
Why? Oppa, don't you dress so ordinary?
Yeah but he likes street fashion
Oh, Kiki, she's still young, so that's possible!
I guess so
Sometimes I get really upset when my clothes disappear.
Kiki likes street fashion, but do you borrow your clothes too?
Yeah, only the expensive ones disappear.
Does Kiki like to go out and play?
It seems like Kiki still doesn't know reality
Kiki, don't smoke while wearing that. That's a piece of cake.
At that moment, it's war ㅡㅡ
I hate the smell of cigarettes too
How many years have you been with your girlfriend?
Um, it's my 7th anniversary this month, Kiki.
Wow, this is awesome.
I'm a long way from that, Kiki
How long have you been dating your boyfriend?
I haven't been dating for very long!
Aha Kiki, it's a good time~
I'm old now and I want to get married ㅜ
When are you getting married, Kiki?
My girlfriend said she wants to do it when she turns 30...
Still 5 years left
Kiki, since you met such a young girlfriend, you should wait that long!
That's why I'm a thief haha Kiki
Kiki: So how old was your girlfriend when you first started dating?
I have nothing to say because I'm a minor...
But I protected you anyway!
When I tell Kiki's friends, they don't say anything?
Got hit Kiki
But I thought I was an adult, but I found out that I was born early
Kiki Oh, so you met when you were 19?
Yeah, I totally got fooled haha
What is your dog's name?
Merongiya Kiki
I often do Merong, so Merong!
Kiki, what's your name? You're so cute!?
Yeah Kiki but she always looks at me like that
Kiki is cute, what kind of puppy is she?
White Maltese Kiki
I have a report on my profile picture
Kiki Oh, you're so cute
But the snout is a bit long?
Yeah, I don't think it's a purebred Maltese.
Did Kiki Merong bring it from the store?
Yeah, I brought it from the store, but I got it cheap!
Kiki, really?
But it's not obedience!?
Yeah, I think it's a mix.
But they all sell like that, right?
Kiki, so that's why you gave the baby away so cheaply?
Yeah, I think I gave about 30 at that time.
Then there is a very high chance of mixing!
Yeah Kiki, but still a character ~ Merong
Oppa, you said you went fishing with your friends last time, right?
Yeah, I wanted to go fishing on a boat.
Kiki and her friends went fishing on a boat!?
Yeah, Yeosu Geomundo is a good fishing spot.
Kiki Yeosu Geomundo?
Did you go fishing on the island?
Yeah right, I love Kiki so much,
There's a world of food
Wow Kiki, you caught a lot of fish?
I caught a red sea bream and ate it as sashimi right away. It was so delicious.
Wow, you're saying that you didn't sell the red sea bream and ate it!?
Kiki, we didn't sell it, we just shared it together.
How many kilos was it!?
If it's red sea bream, it must be really expensive!?
Length is more important than height, about 5 characters.
How many friends did you go with?
The three of us went and had a great time
If three people sleep 5, it's okay!
Yeah Kiki
I ate a lot
Fishing is fun
Oppa, do you play any games other than PUBG?
I'm playing Maple Story these days
Kiki, didn't there used to be a Maple Story chaos before?
Yeah Kiki
I'm thinking of the old days again these days
Where did Kiki Maple come from?
Nexon Kiki,
Just how much money was poured into it,
That's right, Nexon messed around with random draws and caused a huge mess!
Oh really?
I don't know that
Oh, I asked them to reveal the probability because I couldn't get a random draw no matter how much money I spent, and then they found out I was joking!
Oh my gosh Kiki, you guys are bad, you shouldn't be like that ㅜ
There's not much to say these days
It's obviously buried now
Now, those who are going to do it have done it and those who are leaving have left ㅜ
Aha, so that's why it's quiet and fun to raise
Kiki: So there are still a lot of users who do that?
Yeah I think so Kiki
Server crashes all the time
Kiki Hul, this is why Koreans are a problem!
Kiki, they're all gathered on popular servers
Have you ever traveled abroad, oppa?
I was a travel fanatic Kiki
Kiki, really?
Where have you been recently?
I think the last one is Japanese Kiki
Kiki, where did you go in Japan?
Osaka?
Fukuoka... I've been there 5 times, but I just wanted to eat ramen...
Wow, you went to eat Fukuoka ramen?
Yeah, I was really tempted by Ichiran Ramen...
Wow, Ichiran is really delicious,
Yeah, so I went to play right before Corona Kiki
Kiki, thank goodness
Then you haven't been able to go since last year?
Yeah, that's why my body is so ticklish ㅠㅠ
Kiki: That's right. Take your girlfriend to Jeju Island!
Well, I have to go when the timing is right ㅜㅜ
Okay, Kiki, go and get some time!
That's what I'm saying,
My girlfriend is so busy that's why
The weather is sunny now. Is it like that there too?
Ah, I don't know because I don't go out...
Today is a holiday
Kiki, that's right, open the window!
Wow, it's so clear and nice
It rained a lot yesterday
Yeah, the weather here yesterday was no joke either
Right Kiki
I was really sad because I didn't have an umbrella.
Kiki, did you go out yesterday?
Yeah, all of a sudden, when I was going home, it started raining.
Wow Kiki is awesome
So you're not going out today?
Yeah Kiki
But I'm going to go out and try it later
Why are you going to meet your girlfriend today?
Kiki, come out because your mom bought you coffee
Oh really? Kiki
Where are you going?
Kiki, come out right now in front of Starbucks
Kiki, I see
I'm going to go and come back before it rains again
no
They said it wouldn't rain today
Did you know that these days there are things called pet stones?
Huh?
What's your pet rock, Kiki?
These days, instead of a pet, I live with a stone called Kiki.
Kiki, where do you adopt something like that?
I think I'll just order it online!?
Wow, Kiki. That's amazing. There are so many different types of stones?
When I look at it, it looks like a cute character was attached to a rock!?
Kiki... Then I'll bring you to Basalt
Kiki: But these days, raising pets is popular!
I want to raise one too...
I have a pet plant.
Kiki, really?
What kind of plants do you grow!?
I'm an old tree, but call me Gosun.
Kiki, can you grow a pine tree in your house!?
Yeah, I'm growing it on the veranda and it's growing very fast these days.
Kiki, when did you start raising Daebak?
Kiki that was a month ago
I got a gift from an acquaintance... Gosuni
Now, there is a rent crisis in the US too.
Wow, are house prices skyrocketing in our country?
Oh, right, Türkiye did that too, and so did the US...
It seems like house prices are rising a lot worldwide.
That's right, in Turkey, college students are living on the streets right now.
Wow, there's no such thing as a dormitory there?
Now there are kids who can't go to dorms and have to live on rent.
Oh, this is so sad ㅠㅠ
We need to provide more support to young people.
Yes, in the case of Türkiye, the monthly rent has doubled.
Oh, they're telling me to just sit on the street.
That's right, they say the average in the US is now up 13%.
Kiki, what should we do about the housing prices in our country?
Kiki: Right, since when did house prices go up like this?
I think it's because interest rates have dropped significantly since Corona.
Ha, do I even have a house to live in?
Well, I have to go to the countryside to buy a house.
Does your brother wear things like hats well?
Yeah I really like hats
Honey, what brand do you like?
I like the MLB hat
Kiki is hip
MLB!? Oppa, do you like straight hair?
Kiki, I'm just collecting NoNo ball caps
These days, even beanies are pretty
Kiki, these days, beanies are the trend~
Should I buy you one?
Kiki, this is totally great ㅠㅠ
Please make it blue
Kiki sky blue,?
Oppa, you must like wearing my clothes too!?
Yeah right I'm interested in fashion Kiki
Kiki: Okay, then I'll buy you a hat with a fish~
Yeah Kiki, you didn't forget that it's next month, did you?
Kiki Of course, that's why I asked~
I think I'll wear a hat more often because it's winter.
Kiki Then I guess I'll have to buy a fur hat!
Have you ever tried a military hat?
It's so warm Kiki
Oppa, why is your finger hurt?
Merong asked Kiki
Oh my gosh ㅜㅜ Merong isn't a bitch
Yeah, but I guess you got mad after getting your hair done
Oh my gosh ㅜㅜ You don't really like having your baby's hair cut?
This time, the hairdresser did it wrong.
Oh my gosh ㅜㅜ Did you take it out on your brother?
Oh no, Kiki, so I went to the hospital and got it disinfected and put on some medicine.
I guess it didn't bite too deeply, thank goodness.
Yeah right Kiki
But when I wash my hands, it hurts so bad I die ㅜ
Oh my gosh ㅜㅜ Didn't they bandage you at the hospital?
I had a bandage on, but I washed my hands often so it was uncomfortable
I admit that
Kiki, what do you do when you take a bath?
Don't do it while wrapping it in a Kiki plastic bag ㅜㅜ
Oh my gosh is that the best you can do?
Yeah Kiki but the recovery is fast so I'll release it in 2-3 days
Honey, what did you buy online this time!?
Oh, that!
I bought an air fryer Kiki
Kiki Oh, have you tried the Daebak air fryer?
Yeah, I really like grilling chicken breast.
Kiki, have you ever tried grilling something like french fries?
Ah, I like cheese balls, so I grill them and eat them. They're so delicious.
Kiki, how much did you pay for that awesome air fryer?
That's 80 thousand won?
I bought a large capacity one
What brand is it?
It's cheaper than you thought?
I don't remember the name very well,
I just ordered it
Kiki, really?
You should get one with a brand name so that AS can do well later!
Hey, it's a consumable item, so if it breaks, just throw it away and buy a new one.
Kiki, oh my gosh, you had that much money?
I don't skimp on electronics haha
Kiki, you're funny~
Lend me some later too~
Yeah, come and try it. It's amazing.
Who is your favorite celebrity?
I like Moon Geun-young
Kiki's eyes are big and pretty
Moon Geun-young? She's an actress who doesn't appear much these days.
Have you liked it since you were little?
Yeah, that's right. It appeared a lot in old dramas.
Kiki, that Cinderella sister?
I saw that well!
Oh my, that's right, Moon Geun-young's pronunciation back then... was awesome
Yeah I saw the highlights too, it was awesome!
I'm so sad because I haven't been very active lately.
Yeah, but you said you stopped because it hurt?
Oh really?
Where did it hurt?
I didn't know,
I don't know, I think they said it was a rare disease
Oh, I thought you retired because I haven't seen you on screen lately ㅜㅜ
no
Just type in the article and it will come out!
Aha, I see. I'll go and take a look.
Okay, okay, then tell me what disease it is.
Yeah, Kiki, you're a movie director now.
Oppa, the comic I introduced you to was fun, right!?
Oh my gosh, that was so funny
Kiki's Blade
I told you to look at it like that, but you didn't look!
Oh, I heard it so loud that I saw it yesterday
Kiki, but was it worth watching?
Have you seen the movie?
no
I haven't gotten there yet
So now you've seen all of season 1?
I watched up to the middle of season 1
I'm busy these days
Okay Kiki, if you see that, I'll introduce you to something else~
What else is there?
My brother likes action and comedy genres!
That's the genre!
I like comedy more than action
Did you know that One Punch Man has both Kiki and Lee?
Ah Kiki, I think I've seen that character a lot.
Kiki, that male protagonist has bald head. Kiki, you're so funny!
Oh, he was a cool bald guy too, Kiki
What do you eat on Friday night?
I'm going out drinking with my friends today Kiki
Hey, can you eat after 6?
Yeah, it's possible here, but not for you?
Oh, first of all, I haven't been vaccinated.
Then it won't work
You should order delivery food~
therefore...
And I'm originally a homebody so I don't go out so it's okay
So what are you going to eat for dinner tonight?
I think I need to think about it tonight. Recommended.
I recommend Mala Tang. It's delicious.
Kiki Oh, I really like Mala Tang~
Right? That was a great recommendation.
Menu picks complete!
Kiki oh good good
What do you put in your mala-tang?
I put udon noodles in it and eat it
It was chewy and delicious
Oh really?
I eat it with corn noodles!
I eat it with both corn noodles and udon noodles~
When do you plan to become independent?
My goal is within 6 months!
You said you live alone in Busan?
Yes, I'm looking for a room in Busan right now.
I see
What app do you use?
When I looked at the app, it seemed like the photo was washed out? Kiki
Isn't that right?
Kiki, that's right...
Peter Pan also has a lot of fake listings...
So I'm just going to go to real estate after work tomorrow.
Kiki Oh, that's right. You have to do as much research as possible about real estate.
The prices and properties would be different for each property, right...?
Kiki But there's usually a market price in that area
Yeah Kiki
I guess the price in Busan is a bit expensive
Ah, I can't ignore Seoul and Busan...
So I made a plan, but it was a little burdensome.
Kiki, so
How much is your expected monthly rent?
The maximum is 400,000 won per month, and the basic amount will be around 300,000 won!
How far is your current company from your house?
I think it takes about an hour by bus or 30 minutes by car? Haha
Oh really?
Do you have a car now?
It's not my car, it's a company car, it's a rental car, just Kiki
Oh really?
Does your company give you a car too?
Yeah Kiki, I got a morning dose anyway
Oh really? Kiki
Did you just give it to me for commuting?
Yeah, I got it to use for commuting rather than for other purposes.
Did you guys get it because you were dispatched?
You have to ride it at times like that, Kiki
So it's convenient because it takes 30 minutes to get home
So your company's welfare is awesome!
Yeah, I actually like this
Public transportation is so hard ㅠㅠ
Kiki, why aren't there many buses?
There is one, but it's too crowded
It took a long time Kiki
Kiki: Then it would be better to drive yourself.
I'm so happy because I commute by company car, it's so comfortable!
Is there a part-time job you've had that was the hardest?
I am a Coupang loading and unloading logistics center!
It's so hard
Wow, getting on and off is so hard
I know because my boyfriend did that too ㅜ
right?
I go there every week
My back hurts
Kiki, are you still going regularly?
Yes, I passed the regular job application and I go out 5 times a week.
Kiki Oh wow, you got a full-time job!?
Even full-time employees are interviewed these days Kiki
The hourly wage is okay too
Kiki Oh, what is the hourly wage?
It's 9,200 won, but they charge an extra 500 won for getting on and off, so it's 9,700 won!
And don't you also do night shift work?
Yeah, but I'm not a night worker, I'm a full-time day worker!
Kiki Oh, I see
Have you ever been on a night shift?
I just work in one place all the time so that doesn't happen haha
I see. But it's still pretty good, isn't it?
It was okay, Kiki
But I'm going to stop soon
Have you ever been hit by a senior?
I don't have any yet because I enlisted two years ago haha
thank god
But looking at the DP, is there really such a case?
That's too much~
Not to that extent
Kiki But the guy I know really did that ㅜ
Wow, I guess that's what it used to be like
It's changed a lot now
therefore
That guy got locked in a closet and got beaten...
Even if I told the executives, nothing would have changed
therefore...
This guy was at a base on top of a mountain in Gangwon-do...
I think there will be more of that kind of culture in places like that.
So ㅜㅜ
That's why I really didn't want to come back ㅜ
What should I do? I have to return from vacation to finish my military service.
So ㅜㅜ
But it wasn't as bad as D.P.
DPI is too exaggerated
Not now haha
no
I said it was based on a true story!
Really? Kiki
Then it would be a completely old military story
Is there anything you want to learn these days?
I'm interested in cooking these days Kiki
Kiki, you want to get a cooking license?
Yeah, is that a Korean cuisine certificate? I have that.
But do you know that writing that down is incredibly difficult?
Wow, I didn't know that
I was only thinking about practical things haha
That's really hard to write down
You need to know all the causes of food poisoning!
Is that difficult? Kiki
I'll still try
Kiki, I also studied for a year and got the certificate.
A year?
I've been looking at the practical exam for a year, but it's going to take a long time ㅠㅠ
Kiki's skills are great, but you just have to keep practicing!
Yes, the practical test is not burdensome, but I'm worried about the written test.
Kiki But if you get a Korean cuisine certificate, you only need to take practical exams for other cooking certificates!
Oh, I knew that!
But I feel burdened because writing is difficult ㅠㅠ
Kiki, writing is really hard
After all, this is something people eat
Yeah, but I'll give it a try~
Are your parents not feeling well anywhere?
That would be great, but my mother has high blood pressure ㅠㅠ
Oh my gosh ㅜㅜ My dad also has high blood pressure
Be careful of high blood pressure
Always take your medicine
Yes, you have to take medicine for high blood pressure for the rest of your life.
There were so many pills, not just one, haha...
Yeah, that medicine is really expensive too
So, please go to the hospital for regular checkups.
Yeah, and you have to be careful about what you eat too
I think high blood pressure is secretly prevalent among my parents' generation.
That's right, tell them to eat less salt!
Oh, that's a good tip.
I have to tell my mom today
Right, and you shouldn't eat a lot of meat and stuff like that.
okay!
I hope you get better soon, but I heard it takes a long time...
Yeah but my dad eats whatever he wants
Actually, my mother is like that too
Did you eat everything?~ Haha
How do you celebrate things like anniversaries with your girlfriend?
I keep track of years, 100-day periods, and birthdays!
Wow, really?
You guys said it's been over a year now?
Yeah it's been over a year and 3 months~ haha
But isn't it difficult if it's 100 days?
It's not too burdensome yet
What did you guys do?
We're just keeping track of the years and birthdays as the year goes by!
Ah, we should do that too~
That would be convenient
Kiki: Then what do we do when we meet every 100 days?
Let's meet up and date like usual and eat something delicious!
Kiki, don't you exchange things like gifts?
No~
Exchange gifts prepared by each person during dinner
How much does a gift cost?
I think both are possible without much burden for around 100,000 to 200,000 won.
Kiki Oh, wow, if you can make that much in 100 days, you'll have to work hard!
Yeah, you should go to work, earn money, and then go on a date!
What kind of food do you feed your cat?
I'm a Royal Kitten Mother and Baby, you know?
Huh!? Is this coming from Royale?
That'll be right!
I think it's Royal Canin!
Yeah Kiki
How many kilos does that weigh?
I bought a 2kg one for about 30,000 won.
Wow, it's 2kg but it's more expensive than I thought.
Oh, the original price is cheaper than this?
No, isn't the one from Royale worth ten thousand won?
Oh my, why is it so cheap...
Did I buy it wrong? It was 32,000 won
no
You didn't buy it online?
Yeah I just bought it straight from the vet haha
Kiki, it's a lot cheaper if you buy it online!
Ah, now I have to buy it online ㅠㅠ I didn't know
If you buy online, they also give you a lot of feed samples!
I'll have to find the best one by feeding him samples of feed.
Is there a sport you want to learn?
I just want to ride a bike professionally
Can't you just ride a bike?
Equip yourself like that club and do this Kiki
Kiki, those bikes are expensive, costing thousands...
Yeah, whatever the equipment is, it's fast
So I'm going to change my bike too
Kiki, are you going to climb a mountain?
I'm not going to climb a mountain, I'm going to ride a road bike
Hey if you're going to ride a bike why don't you swallow the bike
It's the same bike, Kiki
The only difference is the words
Kiki, aren't you riding a motorcycle or something?
no
Those players have bicycles!
Kiki, are those wheels thick?
That's a mtb and I'll buy this thin and fast wheel road bike
Kiki, really?
Oh, I think I saw that on YouTube too!
Yeah, I'll take a look at that later.
Do you know about the arcade game called Jjangkangpo?
What is that? It's the first time I've heard of it since I was born
Oh really?
Don't you guys have an arcade game called rock-paper-scissors?
What is this? This is my first time hearing about it? Kiki
It's an amusement device
Kiki, you're saying that this famous thing doesn't exist in your area?
I'm not sure what that is
Is it famous there?
Kiki, if you win this arcade game, you get money
Wow, you're giving me money?
I have to go to your neighborhood right now haha
Kiki, do you know this is a railroad town in Gunsan?
Oh I know Kiki
It's famous as a tourist destination there.
Hey, there's this over there, go try it!
So, if Kiki wins, how much money do you get?
I can earn up to 2700 won!
How much do you give if you win once? Haha
Kiki That's random 200~2700 won
Oh, that's okay. 2700 won is totally max?!
Where have you been with your girlfriend recently?
I went to Gangneung last week~
Oh, did you come back from the sheep ranch?
no
It was raining and foggy so I couldn't go there haha
Oh really?
Then where did you go?
How about playing along the Gangneung coast and going to Haslla Art World and Surf Beach?
Haslite World
Oh, is that the famous art museum?
Yeah, that's right
The admission fee was 12,000 won and it was worth seeing.
Oh really?
Art museum admission fees are more expensive than you thought?
Yes, it's an art museum, but it's a bit expensive because there are a lot of photo zones...
Oh right
You're saying you're standing in line there to take pictures?
Yeah, the basic time there is 30 minutes, and it was the same when we went there ㅠㅠ
Kiki Oh my gosh ㅜㅜ So that's why the photos are so pretty?
It depends on the weather, but it's pretty basic haha
Hey Kiki, can you show me the pictures later?
Okay, I'll show you the picture.
I took this when it was completely clear
It's starting to rain here too...
Yeah? It stopped raining here a little while ago haha
Oh my gosh ㅜㅜ I guess I came up here ㅜ
I guess so Kiki
I wish the rain clouds would go to your neighborhood soon.
Kiki, you're so funny
I really wish it would stop raining in Seoul ㅜ
If it rains, just stay at home~
Kiki, I'm playing while listening to the sound of rain right now!
Doesn't the sound of rain sound nice?
Is it just me?
Yes, in this kind of weather, a nap is absolutely necessary.
When you take a nap, you're a total sleeper, right?
Kiki admits, all of a sudden I want to take a nap
I fell asleep listening to the sound of rain earlier haha
I'm so jealous of Kiki
But I can't sleep at night when I sleep
But when it rains, sleeping is the best~
Okay, Kiki, close all the curtains and make it dark~
Next time it rains I'll do it right away haha
Didn't you say your house is in Busan?
Yeah, that's right
But why is that?
The rib house in Busan is going crazy right now.
Rib house?
I really like ribs
Kiki, that's right
But there's chaos here because of recycled food!
Wow, reuse?
Do not reuse any side dishes
That's too much
Do you know of any rib restaurants that serve grilled kimchi?
no
Everywhere I go, there's still fresh kimchi!
I see
This place serves grilled kimchi!
Phew, thank goodness it wasn't where I went~
So, how do you know how it happened?
Huh? I don't know, Kiki, how did you get caught?
Fresh kimchi is also served as a side dish, and it's served mixed with roasted kimchi.
Wow Kiki, of course I'll get caught like this~
Kiki, so
But this boss asked me to look into it...
Oh, right, Kiki
Of course, an apology is mandatory
These days, house prices in Türkiye are no joke.
Turkey is also a country that is familiar to our country haha
That's right, the monthly rent has almost doubled.
Wow, isn't that too high?
It must be burdensome
So the original monthly rent was around 140,000 won...
So it must have gone up to close to 300,000 won now?!
It's 240,000 won now
It's a bit like the monthly rent in Seoul going from 500,000 won to 1 million won!
Wow, it's so expensive. If I were you, I'd have to rent a room...
So, when I applied to university in our country, it felt really real...
So college students lost all their homes?
So I'm living on the streets ㅜㅜ I'm so sad
Wow, homeless...?
If I were you, I'd just go home.
But there are some kids who can't go home ㅜ
So you're just living as a real homeless person?
Oh, they were laying out a mat outside.
Wow, it's such a shame, it had to be Turkey ㅠㅠ
Do you have a tattoo or something?
no
My body is completely clean Kiki
Oh really?
Your parents don't like it?
Of course my parents are closed off
Kiki But if you get a tattoo wrong, it'll be even harder to erase itㅜ
Oh my gosh, I don't think I'll even think about erasing it, it hurts so much
Yeah, I saw that video and I cried so much...
I didn't even think about trying
Does Kiki's girlfriend have a tattoo or something?
Yeah, lettering? There is something like that!
Oh, these days a lot of women get lettering tattoos!
Yeah, but I heard that you end up regretting it a lot later.
Oh really? Why?
The text isn't that great?
no
As you get older, your skin becomes less elastic.
Oh, I see ㅜㅜ
Then, are you going to erase it?
I can't even erase it, it hurts so much...
What are you eating for health these days?
Nothing special, maybe some vitamins?~
Where do you get your vitamins?
Omega 3 is just a multivitamin? Take this.
I'm also taking a multivitamin and diet supplement.
Diet supplements?
Isn't that bad for your health?~
But I have to eat it because my stomach is not feeling well.
What does a bad stomach have to do with diet supplements Kiki?
I need help because I can't have bowel movements.
Oh right Kiki
There's a subtle connection, huh?!
Yeah but if you eat too much of this it's not good for you ㅜ
I'm fine with my bowel movements, so I'll just take a multivitamin.
Kiki, that's a good idea.
Oh, and magnesium is good too!
magnesium?
There are a lot of good things
Then you should do it like that haha
Kiki, and use domestic nutritional supplements.
Domestic nutritional supplement? Kiki
Okay, I'll definitely go with domestic products.
What are you buying from Coupang this time?
I bought a cat neck collar today Kiki
Hey Kiki Cat Neck Collar, do they sell those too?
Yeah I needed a cat collar so I ordered rocket delivery
Why is the cat sick again?
Yeah, I need it so I can lick the wound!
Oh my, how much is one of those?
It's around 10,000 won, but mine is a little cheaper at 8,000 won.
Oh really?
Is it because I bought it in a mini size?
In the most mini size!
Kiki is still a kitten
yes?
I have a necktie at home, but I can't use it anyway.
Yeah Kiki, I thought about that too, but the size doesn't fit
Kiki, I bought my house for 15,000 won!
Oh, then the design and quality would be pretty good, right?
Did you buy the Kiki Neckarra after seeing the design?
If it's expensive, the design won't be pretty either~ haha
Do you know all the idols these days?
no
I'm not really interested in idols Kiki
So you're definitely a ballad person?
Yeah I like ballads more than rap
Then do you like Kono?
Yeah, I like singing in Kono!
People who like Kiki Kono like ballads a lot
The ballad is somewhat sad and emotional.
Kiki, you're a very sensitive kid, aren't you?
Of course~
Do you want to go to Kono together next time?
Kiki I like places like Junko better
Where is that?
This is my first time hearing about this?!
Kiki, that karaoke place where they serve food
Oh, it's okay there, Kiki
Want to go next time?
Kiki I'm good
But I play without stopping
Okay, let's go together next time.
Do you know the cartoon called Black Rubber Shoes?
Of course I know, Kiyoung and Kicheol are in it
Kiki, I watched the ramen episode yesterday and why does it look so delicious!!
Ramen? You mean that delicious, curly ramen?
Kiki, that's right, that's Samyang Ramen.
Oh, is that Samyang Ramen?
It's been like that since then!
Kiki: The first ramen to enter our country was Samyang Ramen!
I didn't know Kiki
Is Black Rubber Shoes a Korean comic book?
Kiki, of course
Samyang Ramen was made with the technology learned from Samyang in Japan!
Somehow~
It's been a while since I've seen black rubber shoes, they're fun
Did you know that Kiki's Black Rubber Shoes was originally based on a manga?
Oh really?
Isn't this just the beginning of a comic?
Kiki No, it started out as a comic book
Oh, right, Kiki
Then I guess I'll have to read some comics next time
Kiki, no, that one's been discontinued, right?
Ah... I wanted to see it, but it's too bad ㅠㅠ
Sister, what did you eat for dinner tonight?
I'm getting ready to order chicken today
Oh my, it's not even Friday night for chicken?
You can eat chicken even if it's not Friday!
Hey, where are you eating chicken?
I ordered Kyochon chicken haha
Wow, you know it's definitely a honey combo, right?
I like honey combo the best

Would you like some rice cakes too?
Yeah, how did you know?
Kiki, hey, you're not going to eat that alone, are you?
of course
I'm preparing to eat with my mom right now
Wow, this is awesome. Two servings of rice cakes?
I ordered a set of yeoptteok for two
You two are going to eat it all!?
We'll both eat it all and then Dad will eat it all when he comes.

It's the royal floor but it's too noisy
Huh? It's the 15th floor, why is it so noisy?
The living room window side is the 4th floor road
Then the noise gets seriously louder?
When cars crash, the noise is loud.
Sister, do you have a car?
Yeah I have an Avante

It's the 2019 model, not the new one
Kiki, you're only two years old, baby~

Sister, how many years have you been wearing that?
I've been wearing it for 5 years now
Wow Kiki, wouldn't that be enough to tear up your sleeves?
Kiki, so my mom told me to throw it away, but I just kept it.
Kiki Huh? You still have that now?
Yeah, it's my precious thing.
Did your sister say she had a younger brother?
Why do I have an older brother?

Still, I'm glad we're meeting well!

If Kiki and Mobile are 208, aren't they old?
I guess you could call me an old hand!
Sister, aren't you going somewhere to play for Christmas this year?

Oh my, this is really amazing in Hongdae?
Oh, but that person is the one who actually created Dalgona in Ogame!
Wow, wow, I want to see it too
But there were so many people gathered that he was sensitive.
Oh really?
I think I would do the same
Looks like someone was taking a video with their phone!
But I think I would take a picture because it's so interesting
But the problem is that I took a picture of the president's face too ㅜㅜ
Oh, it's too much to take a picture of the boss's face
I happened to see an article today and they said they had a headache because of that interview!

Me too Kiki
But it's our brother's country, so my heart hurts a little.
It really breaks my heart, he's my brother
In the US, the average monthly rent has gone up by 13 percent!
The rent went up that much? Wow
So the US government introduced a bill to sanction this, but real estate agents are strongly opposed to it!
Why are real estate agents so resistant?
Because it's their way of making a living, and they're proposing a law to regulate it!
Oh, it's too much for me to earn a living
Kiki But from the citizens' perspective, some level of coordination is necessary.
Yeah, that's right
Does your sister like wearing earrings?
Yeah I really like wearing earrings
Sister, what design of earrings do you like?
I prefer a sophisticated design
Which brand do you prefer that makes such designs?
I like Louis Vuitton
Was Louis Vuitton also a brand that made earrings?

Chanel knew how to make perfume!
So does Chanel make earrings too?
I don't know about Chanel?
I know how to make perfume
Kiki, but if it's made by Louis Vuitton, isn't it really expensive?
Yeah, it's really expensive.
Still pretty
How much for a pair of Kiki earrings?

Oh my gosh, Kiki. Then I have to buy it online.
Yeah, online is the best

That guy must have already started middle school, right?
Then you will be studying hard when you enter middle school.
Kiki time really flies ㅜㅜ
I want to see that guy in another movie later!
That's why I miss you too, Yesung ㅠㅠ
What are you having for dinner tonight, honey?

No, I ate it with my girlfriend and my younger sibling who works at Kiki
Kiki Oh~ Is it possible for 3 people to eat there after 6 o'clock?
Yeah, this place can accommodate up to 4 people Kiki
I envy you Kiki
I ate with my boyfriend yesterday~
Oh, gopchang? That's supposed to be shared between two people Kiki
Yeah but the two of us came out to 70,000 won Kiki
I think the three of us got 80,000 won too Kiki
Kiki, is that the price for just the tripe?
I ate both the tripe and the stew Kiki
Wow, even stew? Kiki
I have one gospel meal in the middle!
I should have fried rice ㅠㅠ
The stew didn't taste good...
Does your brother live with his parents?
Yeah I still live with my parents Kiki
How old is your brother now?
I'm 29 now... and I'm about to turn 30.
Don't your parents tell you to get married?
Kiki, you don't talk about leaving home because you work with me
Aah Kiki, what are you doing now?
I'm helping my parents at the Kiki Makguksu store
Then the house and the store would be connected?
Yeah, pretty close
About 5 minutes by car?
Kiki, I see
I guess I can just walk~
No, it's not that bad because it's a big road Kiki
What time does the store open?
I always wake up around 10:30 Kiki
Oh, right, Kiki
Are you going to work with your parents?
no
Your parents are in there Kiki
What kind of car does your brother drive?
Have you never seen mine?
Rexton big car kiki
Hmm! Rexton? I'm hearing that for the first time!
Oh, there's a cargo area behind this, Kiki
Really big
Oh my gosh, Kiki, did you buy that because it's pretty?
No, I had a lot to do while working from home so I didn't have a choice ㅠㅠ
Kiki, do you use it for work and also for personal use?
Yeah, I personally ride it and use it for work, it's a versatile Kiki.
But if it's a big car, it'll eat up a lot of gas ㅜ
That's also really inconvenient when parking Kiki
Kiki Oh seriously, but if you drive such a big car, you must be a good driver!
Didn't you know I'm a former driver? Kiki
Oh,? There are a lot of people around me who used to be drivers, right? Kiki
Kiki, you must be sending me to drive around Kiki
Kiki, that's Kiki
Do you ride that on dates?
Yeah, I'm dating that too, Kiki
My brother's house must have been really busy in the summer!
That's right, in the summer there's no time to breathe ㅠㅠ
Oh my gosh ㅜㅜ How many hours did you say you work?
I go in the morning and finish in the evening, but in the summer it finishes even later ㅠㅠ
Oh my gosh. Then how much is your daily sales?
I think it's different every time Kiki
Kiki is different depending on the weather
We'll have the highest sales when cicadas sing the most in summer!
Yeah, I think it was around 2-3 million won a day at that time. Kiki
Then how do you do business in winter?
At that time, I changed the menu to Yukgaejang
Oh Kiki Yukgaejang Kiki
Are you coming to eat a lot of Yukgaejang?
Yeah, I'm having that with kalguksu Kiki
I have to go eat some kalguksu at my brother's house!
Yeah, you come and visit too
I'll give you service!
Oh, if you're going to get kalguksu, do you also get bossam?
No, there are dumplings
I ate dumplings haha
Brother, if you were a former driver, what did you drive?
Am I just a taxi driver for the higher-ups? Kiki
Huh!? Isn't that something that needs to be interviewed?
No, that's not necessarily the case, is it? Haha
Brother, weren't you the executive driver?
Yeah, that's right
But I didn't have an interview, Kiki
okay?
As far as I know, executive drivers have to go through interviews?
okay?
I think it just happened somehow, but I don't know Kiki~
I see. How was your military service?
Well, I think it was delicious back then, Kiki
Have you tried Gunderia too, Oppa?
Of course, that's our memory Kiki
Kiki, I really want to eat that with strawberry jam on it!
But eating outside and eating inside are definitely different Kiki
Then, have you ever tried the Gunderia Burger that was sold at Lotteria?
No I haven't tried that one. I don't think it'll taste good haha
Did your brother graduate from college?
Or did you just graduate from high school?
I graduated from high school but I went to college and came back Kiki
Kiki, you took a leave of absence because of the military and then just dropped out?
It hasn't been processed yet and I guess it's still on leave? Kiki
Wow, is it okay to just do that?
Yeah, but Kiki said it didn't matter
Oh, that's amazing
Can I go back to school now?
Yeah, I could do that, but I have no intention of going Kiki
Bro, what did you major in college?
My major was food chemistry, Kiki
But it's still the same food now, Kiki
Is that how you got into it?
Kiki-chan is amazing
Kiki, how about a little bit of what you learned in college that helps you in your daily life?
No, not at all
This is something we need to experiment with, Kiki.
Kiki, oh my, Kiki, where are you going to go if you learn things like that?
Quality or researcher? This is the way to go Kiki
What about your family members?
Woojip has an older brother and parents, so there are four of them.
Oh, I see. How old are you now?
My brother is 4 years older than me. Kiki
Then, your brother must have treated you very well~
No, it would have been better if it didn't match at all, Kiki
Have you been getting beaten by Kiki hyung since you were little?
I can't even count the number of times I've been hit by my brother Kiki
Kiki oh my gosh ㅜㅜ where are you now?
Brother, I'm working in Seoul now. Kiki
Oh my, where in Seoul?
I'm in Seoul too!
Kiki, that's right, I heard it's tough living there Kiki
Kiki, that's right, I rode the hell train today too,
I've experienced that hell train once too Kiki
Oh really?
Just experience it and don't come again.
Yeah, I think that one time would be enough, Kiki
Does your brother have a girlfriend now?
Yeah, I have a girlfriend of about 6 months now, Kiki.
Oh really?
It's only been six months?
Yeah, it seems really old, but that's all there is to it, Kiki
Kiki: But it's good that you have a girlfriend now, right?
Then how pretty and lovely it is ^^
Kiki, isn't that too mechanical of an answer?
Yeah, I'm going to steal this, Kiki
You should say this Kiki
When is Kiki's girlfriend's birthday?
I thought it was coming soon?
Yes, it's coming soon
It's your birthday in a week... Kiki
Kiki Oh, do you have a birthday present in mind?
No, I already gave you a present, Kiki.
Oh my! You already gave me a present?
Yes, I made a reservation and got a phone stand
Wow, as expected, if you earn a lot of money, you'll be rich!
no
It's not that big, I'm just a little lazy haha
Don't you have a dog?
We have a dog that guards our house haha
Kiki, was that a puppy raised outside?
Yes, Kiki is always barking in the yard.
Kiki, is there a well-blended outbreak that everyone can get along with?
They don't match, but the feet are right Kiki
What color is Kiki's baby's fur?
It's white, but now I see it looks gray Kiki
Oh really?
Isn't that because you don't wash?
Yeah, but I said you don't wash the ones you grow in the yard!
Kiki, is that kid like a Jindo dog?
No, when I look at the fur, I think it looks more like a Shih Tzu Kiki
Is this really a real Korean outbreak? Kiki
Yeah, that's right
So it has a very country feel to it Kiki
Kiki is also the cutest Shigorjabur paper in the world!
I wish a cute Injeolmi would come to my house too Kiki
Oppa, what kind of exercise have you been doing these days?
I'm learning yoga these days Kiki
Kiki, did you say you were going with that girlfriend?
Yeah, it's so embarrassing, but I was dragged around because Kiki asked me to go with him.
Kiki Oppa, you have to wear yoga pants there Kiki
no
Just wear a detective ring and go Kiki
Don't they usually tell you to wear yoga clothes?
I'm a guy so I don't think so Kiki
I'm alone
Kiki Aah Kiki What time is it?
I usually go to Kiki around 8 or 9 o'clock after work.
Will there be a lot of people then?
Yeah, if you go then, there will definitely be about 10 people. Kiki
I see. Then, if you include your girlfriend and brother, there will be about 12 people?
No, I think there are about 10 people including me!
Kiki Oh, how many months has it been now?
It's been about 6 months Kiki
Still green
Does your brother often go on PC room dates?
no
I play games at home all the time Kiki
Enjoy it alone
okay?
I heard there's a PC room called Cheolgu in Nonsan?
Yeah, they say it's good there, but my house is a PC room Kiki
Kiki Oh daebak
Do you have a dual computer at home?
It's not a dual, but the main body specifications are not lacking.
Wow Kiki, but the main unit is actually better than the monitor!
You know that one? The one with the bright lights, Kiki
Kiki Oh Neon Sign Oh my gosh, is that the real thing?
Then if anyone sees it they'll compliment it and say it's cool haha
Kiki Oh daebak
Did you assemble that?
No, I bought it and they put it together for me. Kiki
My boyfriend can assemble that~
Oh, then next time you should ask your boyfriend~
Kiki Okay, I'll ask my boyfriend~
Okay okay
Then I'll prepare to upgrade Kiki
Didn't you say you went somewhere with your girlfriend this time?
Yeah, I went to Jeju Island this time~
Wow, I'm jealous ㅜ
What did you do there?
Well I was just a photographer
Nothing
Kiki, so did you take a good picture?
Strangely, I felt like I wasn't doing well, Kiki
Kiki, no, my brother doesn't come out often
Is your girlfriend like that?
Just me... I think he's doing pretty well? Kiki
Kiki: Then it's not a camera problem?
Maybe your lover's fingers are weird Kiki
I need to go to Kiki Yoga more diligently~
Ah, if your fingers are flexible, you can take better pictures? Kiki
Kiki, I don't think your fingers are the problem either~
Both of them are photographers, so the composition is weird. Kiki
Are you sure there's a problem outside? Kiki
Oh, I think there's something wrong with your face, Kiki...
Wow, is the weather in Nonsan real?
Oh, it's so cold here ㅠㅠ
I think I'm going to catch a cold ㅠㅠ
A friend I know already took out her padding!
Wow, that guy is not joking.
Should I take it out too?
I have a sister who loves Kiki North Face!
What is that Kiki
When is North coming out? Kiki
Kiki said it was something she had been wearing since long ago!
I think there should be a hole in there?
I already said that!
Ask me how many times I've been to a tailor shop, Bakiki.
Kiki oki kiki
What did you wear today, oppa?
I just wore a windbreaker and pants? Kiki
Oh, oppa, you're wearing that because you're going to work soon?
The windbreaker blocks the wind well, why is that, Kiki?
Kiki, I see
My brother doesn't seem to catch a cold very easily!
No, I'm cold ㅠㅠ I'm okay because I'm driving Kiki
This time, I took a hidden camera photo in Singapore and it turned out to be of a Korean person!
Hey, why are you embarrassing the country?
therefore!
He was even an interpreter at the North American summit!
Why would you go to another country to commit such a crime?
So Kiki
If it had been done during the North American summit, the face would have been shown too!
So, I guess my personal information was completely wiped out? Kiki
Kiki ha, this is a disgrace to the country and to the parents!
I don't think I can go anywhere Kiki
I'm embarrassed
Wow, looking at your age, you're now 28.
Wow, you're old enough to eat and still have no thoughts?
He was sentenced to 22 weeks in prison in Singapore and his personal information was made public.
They only gave me 22 weeks?
Shouldn't it go in further?
But if you get caught in Korea, you'll just get fined and that's it.
Our country is worse Kiki
Not really
Kiki, so you got caught filming illegally in the bathroom? Kiki
I wish those criminals would just be cut out haha
Wow Bitcoin is rising again!
Hey, that was a drop, but it's going back up?
They say it's $57,000 now!?
How much is that in Korean Won?
Oh, multiply that by 1300 won. Kiki now.
Sorry, I don't want to knock either
Are you saying there are just a lot? Kiki
Oh, I just tried it and it's 75 million won!
Wow, the price has gone up a lot?
Ah, I should have just bought it and kept it ㅠㅠ
They say it went up 30% this month!
Why did it suddenly go up like that?
Yeah, I mean, but doesn't this happen all the time?
Yeah, I'm nervous so I honestly can't do coins Kiki
Yeah ㅜㅜ
Remember that time? When Dogecoin crashed?
Did you lose money on Dogecoin? Kiki
Kiki, it's not me, it's my boyfriend who fights with me so much because of that!
Oh, it's my boyfriend's money, so what?
Just leave it alone~
Where do you usually buy your clothes, oppa?
I wear clothes that my girlfriend buys me.
Kiki, I think that would be better, oppa~
Kiki always teases me for not being able to wear clothes
Kiki: So, do you go shopping with your girlfriend?
Yeah, that's true, and the dog goes shopping and buys things, Kiki
Then what style of clothes should I buy for her?
Dogs just seem to prefer a clean style Kiki
Then, should I buy you something like a shirt with cotton pants?
Yeah, that's right
I buy a lot of things with that kind of feeling, Kiki
Polo shirts are pretty these days~
But that price is no joke, 80,000 won per sheet ㅡㅡ
Wow, I'd rather buy 4 of them than spend that money!
So I'm wondering if I should buy an imitation Kiki
But I can't tell the difference between salty and steamed. It's okay Kiki
That's right, your face is a luxury item so you can handle it all haha
Has your brother never been in a car accident?
I was watching a movie and someone hit my car in the parking lot. Kiki
Huh? Oppa, you were just parked?
Yeah, so that guy asked 100% Kiki
Kiki, isn't it hard to hit a still car?
It wasn't even something that could cause an accident, Kiki
Kiki's opponent must have been a total beginner!
Yeah, but you know what's even funnier?
Is there anything funnier in that situation?
Kiki, I called the insurance company and asked about my fault.
Kiki, was that the car that gave you a glimmer of hope?
But I felt a bit bad, Kiki
Yeah Kiki
But in those cases, aren't you usually not covered by insurance?
But the car is completely broken?...
Hey,? You didn't just lightly press it in that state, did you?
Yeah, that's right
Kiki, it was completely shattered
Have you ever traded stocks, oppa?
Of course I'm investing in stocks Kiki
really?
Oppa, you have 4 monitors too?
No I only do it on my phone Kiki
If you have a cell phone, you need a public certificate, right?
Is this required when you first register?
Just log in now Kiki
When you go into the app, do you immediately see the stocks my brother bought?
Yeah, just enter your password and go in.
But is red better or blue better?
I like the red one, but it's hard to see Kiki Kiki
Then, can I scold my boyfriend for only seeing blue?
no
You must be feeling down, just comfort me, Kiki
Oh, I see
Then what does -30 mean?
Oh, that means 30 percent flew away haha
You should have invested that money in me instead!
Oh, or maybe it's just a minus of 30 won Kiki
Honey, is there a TV show you watch a lot these days?
I live alone these days. I watch this a lot. Kiki
I heard that I'm going to be really fun on Na-hon-san this time. Who's in it?
I don't know either?
I just watch the reruns all the time Kiki
Kiki I just keep watching Sunghoon's mukbang
Dog, I heard that grilled clams are really popular these days?
Wow, grilled clams look delicious ㅜㅜ
I like clams too
I don't eat seafood so I just did that Kiki
Wow, why don't you like seafood?
I don't really like bloody things ㅠㅠ
So don't eat Kiki
Wow ㅜㅜ I really like it and did you see Sunghoon's beef mukbang?
No, I only remember the dog eating cereal Kiki
Kiki, is that Sunghoon eating a box?
Yeah, just pour the milk into the bucket Kiki
Kiki right Kiki
But that looks delicious
I'm going to try eating it like that next time too~
Oppa, do you remember the cartoons you watched when you were young?
I've seen a lot of the Kkurki Guard before Kiki
Kiki's Little Sister Defense Force?
I'd rather watch Magic Warrior Mirgaon Kiki
Is that the correct title?
Is this the first time you're hearing about it?
Didn't you know that this is Yoo Seung-ho's debut work?
Oh Seungho? He's close to me too, Kiki
Kiki, are you sure?
Are you close with Seungho?
Yeah, I have a friend who is ** too haha
Kiki, your last name isn't Yu? ~?
Ugh... unfortunately, Mr. Yoo is not like that, Kiki
Oh, I see~ But the defense team is a cartoon?
It's a cartoon featuring the 12 zodiac signs
I studied with that, Kiki
Judging from the title, it looks like it's being done by IBS.
No, that's not true
It's a pity that you don't know this ^^
Kiki, you don't really want to know~?
I'll rent the video and watch it later Kiki
Do you know what Greek yogurt is?
Yeah, that's trendy these days.
Then have you tried that?
No, I haven't tried it yet!
I tried it for the first time today!
Wow, so how did it taste?
Would you say the yogurt tastes a little dry?
Really? That's very specific.
It must have been delicious!
Yeah but this price is shocking!
Kiki, that's right, yogurt is so expensive these days ㅠ
Kiki and Han cost 5,000 won for 200 grams!
I'm going to go to a cafe later and try it!
Cafe? Any good places?
Some info!
I heard that a new cafe opened in **dong this time.
Wow **Dong Kiki **Dong Seoul isn't it?
Oh! It appears a lot on SNS.
Let's go later
Are you living with your parents now?
no
I live with a friend now!
Wow, you live with a roommate? Just the two of you?
Yeah, that's right, we live together haha
Are you living together in a dorm?
no
I live alone so I have to pay rent!
I see. How much is the monthly rent?
About 200,000 won each for two people?
So, you guys have a 1.5 room? Or a two room?
Oh, that's right, so it's not as big as I thought.
Then, do you two sleep together in the room?
I thought it would be uncomfortable, so we decided to have separate rooms!
So who got kicked out to the living room? Kiki
I got kicked out to the living room because I paid less Kiki Q ㅠㅠ
Kiki, how much more did that guy pay?
I paid about 100 thousand won more
Are you going to school now?
Yeah, I'm going to school now
Then, do you take the bus to school?
I take the bus too, but I take the subway more often
Are you living in Suwon now?
Yeah, I live in Suwon now~
So, when going to school, is it better to take the subway or the bus?
I think the subway is better!
How many minutes does it take by subway?
The train takes about 30 minutes, but the bus takes an hour.
Wow Kiki, then it has to be the train!
That's right! I wish the subway would run more often ㅠ
Are you having trouble getting on the Kiki train because the train intervals are short?
It's a bit small, because it's a new route haha
I see. How many minutes does it take to get to the subway from your house?
It takes about 20 minutes from home.
Are you working part-time now?
Oh, I'm working part-time right now!
Oh, I see. What kind of part-time job do you have?
I work part-time at a PC room haha
Oh, I hear you've been seeing a lot of PC room faces lately?
So I guess I got picked
Kiki, are you really confident that your parents will take care of you!?
sorry
My parents won't let me
Kiki, how much is the hourly wage there?
Is it the lowest?
About ten thousand won including holiday pay?
Wow, but they still give me all the holiday pay?
That's why the boss is so kind!
Kiki, is that where they make food too?
Yeah, it was easy to make food!
But isn't it difficult because there are so many types?
I think it's okay because our PC room is small.
Have you ever visited a friend?
No, I've never been to an interview
I've been to Kiki once
Oh really?
What if I go for an interview?
There are just so many tough guys Kiki
I don't think I'll be able to tell who's who when I go.
Kiki, not that much, just something funny!
I should also go and meet him sometime later when I get the chance.
Kiki, do you have any friends who haven't gone to the military yet?
Come to think of it, I think I just finished my military service?
Kiki, you don't have to go, it's a waste of time,
Right... I guess there are only tough guys anyway.
It really took a long time to go to Kiki Kiki
Yeah, these days the military bases are too far away
Kiki: It seems like military bases are far away everywhere in the country!
That's right, it must be hard to protect the country ㅠㅠ
What are you studying these days?
I'm studying English these days!
Oh~ Can you speak English when you go abroad?
No, I can't converse...
How much do you listen?
Kiki Oh, that's enough, be my interpreter~
Instead, I can't speak... ㅠㅠ
Kiki it's okay
Can you read it?
Of course!
I'll read it to your heart's content
Then that's fine. I have to go on the train trip with you!
But do you need English on a train trip?
You need to know where to get off!
I'm already so scared...
Kiki it's okay
You said you were studying now~
I'll study more from today
Kiki, do it for at least 3 hours a day!
Wow, that's a bit harsh... haha
Are your parents in good health these days?
Oh my, you're so healthy these days.
Kiki, are you getting your health checkups regularly?
But strangely, he doesn't get health checkups very often.
Huh? Isn't this the age you should be receiving treatment at now?
Yeah, that's right, but you keep saying it's annoying and don't go ㅠㅠ
So you've never received one until now?
No, I haven't received it recently
When you got it before, you didn't say anything hurt?
Yeah, yeah, so I'm not forcing you right now!
Kiki, how old are your parents now?
You're both 60 years old!
Oh, then I have to get it once every two years ㅜㅜ
Yeah, listening to you, I think I should go get a health checkup.
Are the last digits of your birth dates even or odd?
Both of you are odd numbers
Do you have a boyfriend now?
No I don't have a boyfriend
So how long has it been since you broke up with your ex?
It's been a while, maybe a year?
Oh my gosh ㅜㅜ How did we break up ㅜ
Are you full?
I was tea...
That guy kicked me...
What the heck is this ㅜㅜ
What don't you like!?
That guy cheated on me!
Oh, but you're saying he kicked you?
Even if you beg, you can still get a hat on sale!?
Oh, so the balance between the opposing sides is also the same
So, Kiki, do you know what she's doing now?
No, I don't know anything because they're all blocked now
Kiki, you did well
That Phil guy is at it again!
I really need to block all the recognition
Yeah, I wish those guys knew he's a playboy!
I spread the word a little bit around!
Do you have any pets at home?
No, I don't have any pets at home
Don't you have any children to raise both at home and in your studio?
Yeah, but there are a lot of people raising them around me.
So, Kiki, don't you want to raise one too?
Yes, I want to raise it, but I can't just bring it in ㅠㅠ
So, you want to raise a puppy?
Oh my the puppy is so cute and nice ㅠㅠ
What kind of dog is it? Maltese Bichon?
If I raise one, I want to raise it as a large dog!
Oh Kiki, you don't know that big dogs really poop people?
Then I guess I'll just have to be satisfied with my younger sibling.
Kiki, you have a companion who can understand you~
Yeah, right~ Let's just go to a dog cafe later
Kiki oh good
It's been a while since I've been there, so I should go with you!
Then let's meet up next week
Have you ever been hiking?
Of course, hiking is good.
Wow, are you a hiking enthusiast?
It's not that hard!
Kiki and I went there last time and threw upㅜ
Where did you go and you even threw up ㅠㅠ
Do you know of Daedunsan, a famous mountain in South Chungcheong Province?
No, I don't know, but is it a notorious place?
Well, it's not that high, but it's a bit of an intermediate course?
Don't go there
It's too dangerous
Kiki, I went there without knowing anything and almost died!
Wow, I only went to beginner level!
Kiki But isn't the beginner's course just a walking path?
If you're not a beginner, it's too difficult.
Kiki, when was the last time you went?
Oh, I went last week.
What game do you like the most?
I like Overwatch the most
Kiki, Overwatch is popular these days, right?
Then then there's nothing like Overwatch!
Then, can you play games while working part-time?
no...
I hope that happens ㅠ
Kiki: Then just sit at the counter?
No, don't use your phone secretly!
Kiki, I saw my friend and he said there was a PC at the counter?
Oh my, where is that PC room? I want to go there too...
Kiki, are you confident that you can come all the way to Nonsan and work part-time?
Is there any military there?
How to Nonsan...
Kiki no Kiki
Are you ignoring Nonsan now?
It's not Kiki
I'll just go out and play next time
Kiki Oki
Come eat some Nonsan strawberries~
Nonsan is the best for PC rooms and strawberries!
Is there anywhere you want to go?
I really want to go abroad these days!
How many years has it been since you last went abroad?
I think it's been about two years?
Wow, so you went right before the coronavirus outbreak?
Oh, that's right. I haven't been able to go since Corona came out.
Oh my gosh, where were you back then?
I went to Vladivostok then!
Wow, wow, isn't that the closest European country to our country!?
Oh, right!
Have you been there too?
No, I wanted to go too, but I couldn't go because of the coronavirus outbreak.
Oh, you should go there too, it's really good!
How many nights and days did you go there?
I went for 4 nights and 5 days!
It's small enough there!
I see ㅜㅜ How much did it cost in total?
I don't remember exactly, but around 1 million won?
Wasn't it hotter than you thought today?
Oh really? I'm a little cold today.
Isn't the weather hot in October?
Oh that's right
I was wearing short sleeves
Kiki, what are you talking about short sleeves for in October, and it's mid-October!
I thought it was summer ㅠㅠ
Kiki is so funny lol
I got water in my armpit Kiki
Your birthday present this year is deodorant.
Oh honey Kiki is so good
I feel like I'm going to sweat even in winter!
What do you think the weather will be like tomorrow?
Tomorrow? It looks similar.
Tomorrow, our company plans to turn on the air conditioning!
That would be nice, we don't really turn on the air conditioner ㅠ
Kiki, really?
What should I do if I feel uneasy?
That's why I'm using deotrant too haha
Kiki Oh wow, I have to take what's yours~
There are already several
Take it lol
Wow, there is bullying even these days?
Oh really? This is too much!
Even the broadcasting station announcer was abusive!
How is that guy?
Kiki, you're an announcer, so how can you run away with a dine-and-dash?
So this is really too much ㅠ
They didn't even give me 1.5 million won for makeup ㅜ
It's not even 10,000 won or 20,000 won, but 1.5 million won is too much ㅠㅠ
That's right, I even got to fly here and get my makeup done!
That person must have had a really hard time ㅠ
So ㅜㅜ But this person's mom is also a problem!
Why that guy's mom?
This announcer's mother said she didn't want to pay for the makeup she did on her announcer!
Instead of drying it, you just add more oil...
So ㅜㅜ It looks like the announcer's identity will be revealed soon!
I'll be waiting for the article!
Now they say there's an edible coronavirus treatment?
Wow, this would be so great!
It keeps coming up and coming up, and now they say a decision will be made in a few weeks!
I hope it comes out soon and comfortably
So ㅜㅜ Is there anyone among your acquaintances who has coronavirus?
No I don't have any yet
There were people around me ㅜㅜ
The aftereffects are no joke!
I really need to get vaccinated soon!
But at that time, there was no vaccine available.
By the way, if you are treated with this treatment, the probability of developing aftereffects is greatly reduced!
Then I should go and take the medicine quickly once it comes out!
It's not Kiki~
I guess I'll get it once I get it?
Oh right... I guess I should just stay home...ㅠ
Right Kiki, but is this expensive or cheap at $700?
$700? Isn't that cheap for getting rid of the hangover?
This is 4 capsules taken twice a day, for a total of 40 doses!
Wow, I have to eat a lot
You said you were dieting, but is it working?
No, I think it's ruined now
Kiki, why were you working so hard!
I couldn't stand seeing the food again ㅠㅠ
Kiki ha, I admit that,
How many meals do you eat a day?
One or two meals a day?
But you have to eat properly at least once a day ㅜ
Yeah, that's why I think I binge eat
Don't you eat snacks in between?
Yeah, I don't eat snacks much
Eat healthy foods like almonds
Otherwise you'll end up binge eating like that!
I really have to do that
I'll go buy almonds tomorrow ㅠㅠ
Kiki Oh, your momentum is amazing?
You got some nuts that day, buy those!
I guess so, please recommend more
Haha just buy the one from No Brand
That's great value for money!
Okay, then I'll go to No Brand tomorrow.
My toes have been itchy lately. Could it be athlete's foot?
Hey, you, that's athlete's foot. Go to the hospital right away.
Oh my gosh, but your toenails aren't yellow?
Oh, so it's not athlete's foot...?
But why do the soles of my feet itch?
So it's not just the soles of your feet that are caught?
Can athlete's foot only affect the soles of your feet?
Well, it's spreading... haha
Oh my gosh ㅜㅜ I really just keep rubbing my feet at work ㅜ
What if I just rub my feet?
Let's go to the hospital quickly.
Or maybe I just bought new socks?
Is this why?
Oh, that could be the case?
I'll just endure it until today and go to the hospital tomorrow ㅜ
Go tomorrow and let me know what it's like haha
Kiki, I understand
Luckily, there is a hospital near my house!
It's a good thing it's close ㅠ
Be sure to go tomorrow
What model phone do you have?
I have a galaxy s10
When did that come out?
Isn't the 20th series coming out now?
Maybe so?
It keeps coming out and I'm confused ㅠ
Kiki, when did you buy that?
I think I bought it about a year ago?
Did you go to the store and buy it yourself?
No, this time I bought it over the phone!
Can I buy a cell phone over the phone?
Oh, you can contact the telecommunications company and do it.
Wow, that's really amazing
What did you give as a gift?
There wasn't anything like that, they just gave me a discount
Oh really?
How much discount did you give?
Well, maybe 10 percent
So, that's a discount of about 200,000 won?
Yeah, that's why I called.
Which idol did you like the most when you were a student?
I liked EXO the most
Wow EXO Xiumin is mine, don't touch him!
Xiumin take it
I'm Chen...
Kiki Chen,? Didn't Chen already get taken by someone?
That's right... he left first without anyone knowing...
no
He said that the fans knew but turned a blind eye!
Why was I the only one who didn't know that?
Kiki: So Chen has completely withdrawn?
I think it was because I got married?
ㅜㅜ So now there are 12 members in EXO?
Yeah, they're all leaving one by one.
Oh, come to think of it, didn't all the Chinese members leave?
So it seemed like there weren't many people?
ㅜㅜ EXO was really the top idol group!
So there are too many other idols now
Have you seen A Gift from Room 7?
Wow, I totally watched A Gift from Room 7!
Did you see that at the cinema?
Oh, I saw it at the cinema.
Do you remember what year it was?
Oh no, I don't remember
Was this the movie that came out when I was a student?
I think that might have been the case?
Wow, so much time has passed? ㅜ
Now I can't even remember when I saw it ㅠ
Kiki I saw that on TV recently and I cried when I saw it again ㅜ
Yeah, that's a sad movie ㅠㅠ
Did you see him getting dragged away at the end?
Oh, it was so sad there
So ㅜㅜ ha, my sensitivity is overflowing again,
I miss seeing you again after a long time
Where are you going out to eat tonight?
I'm probably going to go eat tonkatsu with a friend.
Is there a good tonkatsu restaurant in Busan?
Of course there is a good restaurant in our neighborhood! Kiki
Kiki, is that the place that serves Western food?
No, just udon with tonkatsu?
Ah, on a day like today, udon is the best!
It's been so long since I've had udon that I'm going to eat it ㅠㅠ
Kiki, I want to eat udon too ㅜ It's been a long time since I had udon!
That's right Kiki, it's been a while since I had udon in warm soup
Kiki: Well, I like spicy soup, so I often eat Jjamppong.
Jjamppong? It's so spicy... My lips are freezing.
Just ask Kiki Jjamppong to not be spicy
I just pass because the chili powder is too spicy
Kiki: Then when you go to a Chinese restaurant, do you order Jajangmyeon?
Of course, tangsuyuk is the basic option for jajangmyeon.
Are you living in an apartment or a house now?
I'm neither?~ It's a no-no!
Then it would be a villa, right? Isn't it there?
Hey villa is another concept Kiki
Kiki But I've never lived in a villa before. What do you think?
Our villa doesn't have an elevator so it's total hell.
Oh really? What floor do you live on?
I'm on the 4th floor, but there are only stairs...
Wow ㅜㅜ If you go up to the 4th floor every day, your thighs will be strong
My thighs hurt so much that I had to climb up to the 4th floor to get up.
Kiki, but still, a man needs to have strong thighs!
I just want to go somewhere with a convenient elevator...
Kiki, are your parents thinking of moving?
No, not yet, but won't it be there soon?~
Kiki, I see. There seem to be a lot of new apartments being built these days!
I want to move to a new apartment, but it's expensive...
What kind of car have you driven?
Me? I've rented a lot of Avantes, SUVs, etc.
Oh, what did you try, SUV?
I've driven a lot of cars like Seltos, Trailblazer, and Stonic.
Where did the Trailblazer come from?
That car from Chevrolet is so heavy.
Kiki Really? Then it will consume a lot of oil!
Yes Kiki, but the ride is good and the design is pretty
Kiki, what color were you riding?
Since it's a rental car, most of them are white! Kiki, but that car is black.
Where did you travel and come back from?
I rented a car when I went to Miryang alone haha
You went to Miryang alone?
Yeah Kiki, I just rented a car because I was curious about it.
How much did you pay for that ride per day?
Because it was carsharing, it was by the hour, not by the day.
Have you ever done any other part-time jobs besides getting on and off the truck?
I've been a facilitator before!
A progress agent? A bodyguard or something?
No, I feel like I'm a helper in the hallway when I'm taking an interview or a written test.
Oh really? How much was that hourly wage?
The hourly wage is 10,000 won, but it's worth it haha
Wow, this is totally a sweet deal.
No, but it's still a bit burdensome in cases like interviews.
Kiki, aren't you the one doing the interview, not the one helping?
Yeah, my role is to help the interviewers!
So what is there to be burdened by?
I'm the one who brings the interviewers around so if I make a mistake it'll be a big problem haha
Kiki, it's okay, it's easy, how many hours did you do that?
About 8 hours a day? Excluding 1 hour for meals~
Wow, so you got paid 70,000 won a day?
Yeah, I guess so. Of course, you have to deduct 3.3% tax...
Didn't you have a hard time in the military?
I think training was the hardest though...?
Have you ever done that backpack training?
Marching? Of course, that's always a must Kiki
You know, the Kiki outfit where you walk 20 kilometers?
Yeah Kiki these days it's a 40kg backpack
Wow, 40 kilos? Wow, how can you carry that and walk?
I thought I was going to collapse while doing it~
Kiki, seriously, those shoes are really uncomfortable,
Yeah, combat boots just don't fit me in the first place.
Kiki, my boyfriend said he got really annoyed and went to the hospital.
Yeah, so I just put an extra insole on and wear them.
Wouldn't it be much better to add one more insole?
By my standards, it's different for everyone haha
Kiki Oh, I see. You don't have any blisters on your feet?
No matter what I do, I get blisters on my feet.
Oh my gosh ㅜㅜ Are you calloused now?
No, it disappeared after some time haha
What was the most difficult subject you studied?
I find math the hardest?!
Did you ever have a mathematical foundation?
I don't know when it started, but it was there...
Kiki, did you study with that?
No Kiki, we only learned up to that subject so we don't use it
Oh, I thought I was going to die studying this.
Just the title itself makes me feel like I don't want to do it
Kiki, that's right, I originally liked math, but I started to hate it because of this.
Yeah I'm going to hate math now too haha
Kiki is right, but that doesn't mean other subjects are good either.
I think society is better than ever
Ah Kiki, have you ever studied modern and contemporary history?
Ah, I like things like geography, not that kind of society!
What did you learn in geography?
Studying climate, cities, and countries like that Kiki
I heard your mother wasn't feeling well. How is she doing now?
Yeah, he's hospitalized now and getting better haha
Thank goodness ㅜㅜ How many months will you have to be hospitalized?
They said they are looking at it for a month now, but we have to wait and see how it goes.
Oh, I see. You have to give birth quickly. How many days have you been pregnant?
It's only the third day and it still looks like things have gotten a little better!
Oh, I was really surprised when you said your mother was sick.
It's not like you're really sick, so it's not like that
But didn't you say your arm was broken?
That's right, Kiki, it's a fracture, so a cast would be better.
So ㅜㅜ if it's a fracture, you'll need to wear a cast for about 2 months?
I think I'll probably be hospitalized for a month and receive outpatient treatment for a month.
Yes, my aunt also broke her elbow this time, so I know her well ㅜㅜ
Right? You have to be careful not to bump into anything and cause an accident...
Yeah ㅜㅜ But even if you're careful, you'll still get hurt
Okay haha you have to be careful too you can't let your guard down
How did you and your girlfriends celebrate their birthdays?
We just give gifts, date and that's it
But that's not all, Kiki
Yeah? Other people do surprises and other things too.
Kiki, that's hardly a proposal
Yeah, I just like normal things
Even if you can't take care of Kiki in a big way, it's okay as long as it has meaning
That's right, I'm just careful to keep the meaning in mind.
Kiki: Well, that's not good anymore, even if it's been a while~
Are you just making sense now? Kiki
Kiki, no, we don't even see each other anymore
Wow, you've been together for that long already?!
It's already our 7th anniversary this month ㅜ
You guys dated for a really long time, I'm jealous...
Now I live with friendship and loyalty~
Right Kiki, I'll be following you for the 7th anniversary soon~
My friend's dog was hospitalized this time?
Oh my god, why was the puppy hospitalized...?
The blood inside the dog's body is slightly viscous.
Oh, then doesn't your body hurt a lot?
So, that's why he was hospitalized and was getting a Ringer's injection.
Wow, the vet bills are no joke, right? ㅠㅠ
Right ㅜㅜ I just asked and they said the hospitalization fee alone was over 500,000 won
500,000 won? Since when were you hospitalized?
Starting Friday? I brought it now!
Oh, it's expensive. Kiki, I think it would be burdensome for me.
Yeah, I think it's even more so here in Seoul.
The cost of animal hospitals varies greatly from region to region?
Probably, and the medical bills were around 100
Really? Kiki, then I guess I'll have to give up being the owner.
Kiki, that's right, my spine is also bent right now because of our Obok~
Oh Bok-i did cost a lot of money...
Have you ever been fishing?
Yeah, I tried it once in the ocean, Kiki.
Oh, these days are the best season for squid fishing!
Squid? You catch squid with fishing too? Hahahahahaha
Kiki, I didn't know you could catch them like that!
Oh my gosh I just caught a small fish or something
Kiki, you don't know what kind of fish it is? Is it just something like a pyramid?
Yeah, it was a completely new fish, but it was small.
Oh really? You were fishing on a boat?
No, sit on the harbor breakwater and fish!
Kiki, who did you go do that with?
I went with my dad. My dad is a fishing enthusiast haha
I see. If your dad likes fishing, he must have a lot of fishing equipment.
I followed along because I really liked the equipment~
Kiki, really? Isn't that the one that costs a few hundred dollars?
Yeah, I'm not sure about the price, but it's an expensive piece of equipment!
Have you ever tried everyone's Marvel?
You know, that game Kiki is famous as a mobile game.
Kiki ha, how long have you been doing that?
I'm a veteran who's over level 100~ I've been doing it since long ago
Kiki, you're crazy. What's your character?
I'm that female character, but I don't remember her name.
I only know of female characters who carry a harp
Oh, I think that's right. Team luck is also important these days.
Kiki, her name was probably Muse, right?
Yes Kiki my character Muse Plus
There's also a character called Kiki Muse Plus?
The plus indicates the level, not Kiki
Kiki Oh, I see. Then what were your winning percentages?
The odds of winning are 50%...? It's not that high ㅠㅠ
I see. But isn't a 50% win rate okay?
Yeah? What were your odds of winning, Kiki?
Is there a travel destination you would like to visit?
I still remember Jeju Island from this time
Jeju Island this time? What month did you go?
I went last week and the weather was really nice.
Yeah? Who did you go with then?
I went with my girlfriend. Who would go to Kiki?
Kiki, maybe she went with a friend
My friends are all busy so I go alone or with my girlfriend haha
Kiki's girlfriend seems to really like traveling too
That's right, I met my girlfriend on a trip~
Kiki, that's right. If you met overseas, it's completely fate.
Yeah Kiki, that's why we always travel a lot
Kiki: I see, so that's why you often go on trips for anniversaries?
We tend to celebrate our anniversaries and birthdays in different places!
If you both like it, then that's right~!
Yeah, so I'm planning to go somewhere else this time too.
Oh, the rain has finally stopped!
Really? It would be normal if it stopped by now...
Kiki, you keep coming down, will you come again tomorrow?
Didn't you see the weather forecast? Kiki, it's going to rain a ton.
Wow, that's on the news nationwide?
Yeah Kiki, I'll be back tomorrow too, so don't worry~
Kiki: Isn't it going to be worse if you come tomorrow?
I don't mind because I'll just stay home tomorrow
Kiki I'm planning on staying home too, but I think my boyfriend will come
Oh, then I have no choice but to go out!
Kiki, you're right, you need to get some fresh air
It's raining, so where are you going?
No, I mean I hope it doesn't rain ㅜ
Let's just pray that the weather forecast is wrong.
Kiki, that's right, the weather forecast is only accurate in times like this ㅜ
Well... if it rains tomorrow, I'll just take a nap~
Did you see the article about the taxi driver who lied and said he didn't know?
Wow, isn't that too much? Kiki
So, but this turned out to be a lie, Kiki
Oh, that article is a lie?
No, the taxi driver was lying when he said he didn't know!
Then you did it without knowing, right?
So when I looked at the black box, everything was there
Black boxes can't lie...
I could hear the sound of Kiki's thump and the sound of the woman screaming.
If you knew that much, why did you run away? Kiki
So, when I saw it, it wasn't drunk driving, right?
Wow, a taxi driver is driving drunk? He should definitely be arrested.
Right, I think I'm going to jail now?
It's definitely a prison sentence, but you can't avoid drunk driving and hit-and-run accidents~
Kiki, you're right, you leave people like that,
Hey, you've gone too far~ Now you deserve to be punished!
What vaccine did you get?
I completed the second round with Moderna~
Fortunately, if it's Pfizer, you have to get a booster shot.
Huh? What is a booster shot? It's a buff? Kiki
If it's Pfizer, the preventive effect will decrease later, so you have to get it.
Oh thank goodness it's Moderna. What did you get hit with?
I was told to get Moderna too, so I got that.
Thank goodness Kiki, if it was Pfizer I would have felt wronged
Kiki, my sister, first of all, is Pfizer, right?
Ah...? Then a booster shot is definitely required.
Yeah, but it doesn't have to be right now, but maybe in about 4 months?
Oh, that's a set period of time? I just found out.
Kiki, after two months, the prevention rate gradually decreases.
If that's the case, why did you even make a second one...
Kiki But the experts said not to worry because it doesn't mean there is no prevention rate at all.
Hey, all vaccines are useless~ Moderna is better
Have you ever been to a dermatologist?
I've been getting my beard shaved these days~
Wow, doesn't that hurt like hell?
Does it smell like squid every time you do it? Kiki
Kiki Oh my god, it doesn't hurt, but I saw that and it really hurt?
Yeah it hurts so much Kiki I really hate that stinging feeling
Kiki, how much beard do you have?
I have a lot of beard so I go for laser hair removal...
Kiki so how many times have you received it so far
I got it 7 times and it disappeared more than I thought.
Wow, I got it 7 times, so it must have decreased a lot!
But I heard that it takes more than 15 times to be effective.
Wow, if I get 15, what's the cost?
It costs about 50,000 won at a time, but it varies depending on the part.
Wow, then how much is it for 15 times?
750,000 won...? I think it's worth more than that.
My back hurts so much these days. Why is that?
Really? Aren't you like that because you're working?
I guess so, I've never sat down for this long before.
If your back hurts, buy a brace.
Curved chairs are trendy these days. I'm thinking about buying one!
Oh, I have that at home and I'm still using it.
Kiki Oh really? How much does one of those cost?
It costs about 30,000 won, but it's cheaper if you buy it used.
I see. It was more expensive than I thought.
Yeah, I bought that and tried it out. It was pretty good, wasn't it?~
Yeah? Other people say that it hurts their back more.
Ah, I guess it's different for everyone. I like it...?
Kiki, really? It's 30,000 won each, so I'll have to think about it.
Okay it worked for me haha
Kiki, really? Is your waist feeling good now?
It's okay now, but I think it had some effect.
Are you doing stocks or something?
Yeah I just started out as a kid haha
Kiki, what kind of stocks did you buy?
I like blue chip stocks and big companies like Samsung!
Kiki: But in the case of blue chip stocks, there is something called a dividend!
I just put it in to collect the dividends
Kiki: So this time, Samsung said its dividend would be 1.3%?
These days, I'm going to give you about 500 won, multiply by the amount of money I have!
Kiki, is it true that it's 500 won!? How much did you put in?
I have 20 weeks and get paid ten thousand won per quarter haha
Oh, then I can just go to the PC room for ten thousand won!
Hey Kiki, I'm thinking about investing in other stocks
Kiki, what is that? It can't be Bithumb Coin, right!?
No, I just wanted to buy some other stocks.
Yeah, don't just do Bitcoin, do something else~
Okay, I'll have to look it up haha
What song are you good at singing at karaoke?
Me? I only sing ballads these days
There are multiple singers for ballads too~
I'm a fan of SG Wannabe, especially Kim Jin-ho
Kiki and Kim Jin-ho, this time SG Wannabe has really caught on!
Yeah, that's why I liked it better!
Yeah, the song is so good!? I like Lalala!
Lalala? I like that song too. Do you know my person?
Kiki, you'll probably know that if you listen to the song?
SG Wannabe sings &quot;My Person is the Best&quot; so well
Oh right, but I personally like Monday Kids!
Oh Monday Kids? That group is also famous in the ballad world.
Yeah, I went to Monday Kiz concert too ㅜ
Wow, I'm jealous. How was it? I want to go to the concert too.
Kiki wow, really really good ㅜㅜ I want to go again
Next time, let's go together!
You said you haven't seen Attack on Titan?
Yeah I've never seen Kiki
So, do you know the cartoon called One Punch Man?
Oh, I'm sorry I don't know much about that, I only know the name...
Kiki, this is a really famous manga!?
I don't know ㅠㅠ Do you see that?
Kiki, this is hilarious, I recommend it
Is that it? I wonder what the content is.
The male protagonist is a hero who blows away monsters in one go.
It's totally cool if you're blowing up monsters!
Kiki, but the world view is really awesome!
Then, shall we try One Punch Man today?
Kiki, if you like comics, I highly recommend it
Okay Kiki, I think our genres fit well together.
Kiki Oh, then I recommend watching the manga first and then the anime later!
Okay Kiki, then I'll check it out and let you know what I think.
Sister, have you tried Gongcha Green Tea?
No, I've never had tolerance green tea before. Why?
So have you tried the tolerance drink?
Yeah it's delicious
I like corn ㅠㅠ
Hey Kiki, does that really taste like corn?
No, I don't eat pearls separately, but they taste good with hibiscus Kiki
Oh, so you added pearls to it and ate it?
Pearl doesn't eat anything, what's underneath?
Do they sell hibiscus tea in Gongcha too?
I didn't know!?
Yeah, it's delicious and the color is pretty too haha
Oh really? Is that carbonated?
No, it's not carbonated, it's tea, but the chewy texture underneath is addictive.
Is there anything you can chew on besides pearls?
It looks like a black fruit seed or something.
Oh, I guess that's a fashion statement
I really like that!
That's delicious
Kiki, it's good to eat simply
Sister, are you home now?
Yeah, I'm at home right now, lying down!
Wow, I'm really jealous
Did you say your house and company are close?
Yeah it's close
Today is my day off so I have a great time.
Oh really? You used your vacation days today?
No, no, because it's 5 days a week!
Oh, didn't you say you were going out on Saturday?
Yeah but Saturday is only 4 hours so I'll be gone soon...
I'm jealous ㅠㅠ
Did you say you live with your sister and dog?
No cat~ I'm currently playing Matdongsan Kiki
Ahh Kiki, that delicious mountain smell is no joke~
Yeah, no kidding
It's a mess because they even feed it wet food
Kiki, does it smell more if you feed it wet food?
Yeah, that's right. It's different from when you only feed them food.
Really? We didn't know because we only fed them kibble!
I love wet ...
I'm such a lucky girl today!
Why did something happen?
Did you just get in the car?
No Kiki
I got on the subway and sat down right away!
Oh, I'm so lucky Kiki, it's comfortable
Seriously, Kiki, days like this don't come often!
Ah ㅜㅜ Is it because today is Wednesday?
Why did you do that
no
Rather, there are a lot of people on Wednesdays!? Sit somewhere and go~
Wow, you're lucky, Kiki, you were lucky today, Kiki
Kiki, that's why I sat down and went from Gangnam!
It's a jackpot, Gangnam Kiki. Gangnam is really hard to sit down in.
That's why Kiki, you seem to get on and off a lot in Gangnam!
Line 2, right? Gangnam?
It's in the center so there are a lot of people ㅜㅜ
Yeah, for some reason I wanted to stand in front of that woman~
Your timing was perfect, Kiki.
I hate hell train so much
Right, if I had missed this, I would have been carried away in a bean sprout steamer?
Oh, I hate it so much
I hate that shoving and pushing each other
When did you first work part-time, sister?
I think I first did it in middle school?
Oh, it started really early!
What did you do then?
At that time, my first part-time job was calculating cash at a mart, Kiki
Oh right, you said that scanning barcodes was fun back then!?
Yeah, that one's the oldest, at a Chinese restaurant my brother knows!
Oh, Kiki, if it's your brother, is he your older brother?
No, I first helped out at my close friend's store, Kiki
Aha Kiki, isn't it 24 hours there?
no
I didn't do it at 24 hours ㅜㅜ
I'm tired
Kiki Oh, I'm shivering at 24 o'clock too Kiki
What was the hourly wage?
It was around 7000 won at the time, Kiki, that was the lowest price.
I see. How long have you been going?
In Chinese restaurants, I think I've worked there for about 2-3 years.
Wow, it's been a really long time
Was there no truth?
Why wouldn't it be there?
Wherever you go, there is truth ㅜㅜ
Sister, have you been to see your friend?
No, I didn't go to the interview, but I went once when I went to the training center, Kiki
If you were in training camp, your friend's hair would have been completely shaved. Kiki
Yeah, I cut it really short and I cried too, Kiki
Oh my! You cried because you were my close friend?
No, my parents were crying so I cried too ㅠㅋ
Oh, Kiki, both of your parents cried?
Yeah, I remember it like that, it's been so long ㅜㅠ
How old were you at that time?
I remember I was in my early 21s...
Dirt ㅠㅠ The training camp was probably Nonsan Yukhun, right?
That's right, I went to Yeonmu-dae because Kiki was close by.
T Kiki, who did you go with besides your sister?
We went together with our friends Kiki, all together
Oh my gosh ㅠㅠ You were the friend who went there for the first time?
Yeah, that's my last and my first...
What qualifications does your sister have?
I graduated from high school and studied computer-related stuff and Chinese characters?
Hanja? What level do you have?
I don't remember because I did it in elementary school, maybe 5.6.7.8
Wow, isn't it difficult starting from level 5?
Yeah that was a bit difficult Kiki
Kiki, what grade were you in elementary school?
I don't remember, it was so long ago
Probably in lower grades ㅠㅠ
I first learned it in high school but I forgot it all Kiki
Oh really?
I learned Japanese in high school Kiki
Kiki, what? I learned Chinese, Kiki
Oh really? But now I don't remember anything.
Me too Kiki
I only remember Pingpangchio~
What does that mean?
Kiki only knows Chinese, Ni Hao
This? It means Kiki Table Tennis.
Kiki, isn't it funny?
Table tennis? Table tennis is called Ping Pang Chio Kiki
What did your sister say happened to your brother?
I have a younger brother and a younger sister
Oh right, how old did your little sister say she is now?
My sister is in college now. Kiki is 21 years old.
Did you say your sister is in Jeonju now?
No, I'm in Jeonnam. Kiki
I don't know if it's Gokseong or not
Gokseong? The Gokseong I know?
It's probably the song from the movie Kiki
Oh Kiki, isn't it strange that there's a university there?
I think it's Jeonnam Science University. I've only been there once.
So you're in a college dorm now?
I'm going to live in a dorm and then live on my own because my grades aren't good.
Can't I live in a dorm if my grades aren't good?
They say you can't live in a dorm if your grades aren't good ㅜㅜ
Wow, this is not true at first,
Money is flowing out very quickly
You said you've been with your boyfriend for two years, right?
Yeah, a little over two years!
Wow time really flies
How do you celebrate your anniversary?
Time flies so fast ㅜㅜ
Kiki doesn't celebrate anniversaries separately
So we just celebrate each other's birthdays?
Kiki doesn't even celebrate her birthday
Just whatever you need, when you need it?
But that might be even better!
No I don't like it, it's like that
Kiki, why are you like that? Did something bad happen to you in the past?
No, that's not it, but you still have to celebrate birthdays specially!
That's right, doing something like that on your birthday is a celebration~
Yeah, that's right, but I'll buy you what you need~
Oh~ Your boyfriend is so handsome.
no
You shouldn’t leave it like that…
Kiki That's right, next week is my 7th anniversary too!
7th anniversary!? This couple is even better than me ㅠㅠ
Sister, you said you were going to give the baby wet food earlier!
Yes, make sure to give them wet food in the evening!
Is there a reason you only feed wet food?
I watched YouTube and it said it's good to give wet and dry food together
Really? But doesn't wet brushing make you more likely to get cavities later on?
So brush your teeth every night!
Oh, that's right, it's already too late for our Oh Bok-i.
That's right. They say you have to do that from when you're a baby.
Does your baby like brushing his teeth?
I don't like it
I like toothpaste because chicken tastes good!
Ah Kiki, I see
The day we brush our Obok's teeth is the day we wash our hands too ㅜ
I don't drink water ㅜㅜ
It must hurt so much
So I couldn't do it and ended up getting mouth ulcers.
I heard that it's really hard when you get mouth ulcers ㅠㅠ
Yes, I'm still taking the medicine now.
Propolis? They say it's good to eat that.
Sister, did you go running today?
No, I was going to run, but it's too hot.
Kiki: It's October now and it's hot?
It's really hot during the day because the sun is shining brightly, right?
Whale? Oh, you said today was your day off, right?
Yeah, today is a day off so I'm busy haha
Then what did you do today instead of exercising?
I went to the dermatologist in the morning and ate and rested in the afternoon.
Oh, then you did some walking exercise~
Yeah, I did walk a little bit, Kiki.
Kiki, how many minutes did it take you to walk?
I walked for over 30 minutes
Still, it was a good walk after 30 minutes~
You don't plan on walking 10,000 steps?
I was originally going to walk today, but I gave up because I lifted something heavy.
Kiki, I heard your excuse!
Kiki, it's better than breathing
Sister, there was a game we played yesterday!
What game are you talking about?
Sister, didn't you play the Mabel Mobile game yesterday?
Maple Mobile? I've never done anything like that... Who?
Then, what games did you play on your cell phone?
There are no games installed on the phone!
Didn't you say you didn't like games?
Yeah, sometimes I play cart on the computer?
When you say Kiki a Kart, it comes to me!
Are you good at karts?
I'm not good at it
Kiki, you haven't seen my drifting skills~?
I just do that because eating items is fun
Kiki, I'm the expert at sending flies again!
You get mad when you get bitten by a water fly, but you know what dust is?
You know, I waited and threw it with good timing~!
Oh, that's a good idea too, Kiki
I'm going on a trip this time. Should I go to Busan or Jeju Island?
Of course, Jeju Island is far away, so ask about that~
But I've never been to Busan!
Oh really? What kind of transportation do you use?
First of all, since I'm leaving from Seoul, I'll take a plane!
Oh, on a plane?
Busan is best enjoyed by taking the train.
But these days, airplanes are faster and cheaper than trains!
Oh really? I've been going to Busan a lot lately.
First of all, I've been to Jeju Island three times!
Then I recommend going to Busan!
I'm going for 4 nights and 5 days. Is Busan okay?
Yeah, Busan was nice too
I've been there twice before too
Sister, how much did the security guard cost back then?
The security is about 50 per person? It's generous.
Oh, so it really is true that 1 million won for 2 people?
Yeah, I think it's about that much
Yeah, I live in Daejeon, Kiki
Sister, you said Daejeon just now, right?
Did you call your friend in Nonsan yesterday?
no
Why? It was hot
What happened to the weather?
Yesterday in Nonsan it was so cold that I had to wear a padded jacket!
Oh right, my boyfriend said he was cold
Wasn't Daejeon as cold as Nonsan?
Yeah, it's just perfect for me when I get off work and it's chilly.
Oh, that's right. The older sister I know took out her padding and wore it~
Is that the sister I know? Kiki
That's probably right~
I heard you went to Daecheon yesterday~
Ah, it must be cold if you go to Daecheon ㅜㅜ because it's the sea
Yeah Kiki I thought I was going to die from the heat yesterday!
It's really hot here during the day too ㅠㅠ
Yes, we had a lot of sunshine yesterday too!
But it's a little chilly in the mornings and evenings
Wow, there's an article about someone dying from Moderna!
There were definitely a few of them
Before, there was only news of deaths after receiving Pfizer!
Oh, I see ㅠㅠ
Is Moderna the first?
I think this is the first time I've seen it in an article!
But if someone dies after getting the vaccine, it would be really unfair...
Yes, I got it because the government told me to, but I didn't expect this to happen.
Many healthy people also died.
That's right, this person didn't have any underlying diseases!
So you were in your 40s? 50s?
That's right! I was in my 40s!
My son posted something ㅜ
Wow, my son uploaded it? This is awesome ㅠㅠ
That's right ㅜㅜ I heard he fell down after doing a pitot ㅜ
Then isn't something really wrong?
Oh, that's right. Moderna's side effect is cerebrovascular disease, and I think they said that was the cause of death!
Wow, is this really a hit or miss thing?
***'s approval rating has dropped a lot due to poor employment conditions.
Wasn't it ***?
I didn't even know it had changed
It changed from *** to *** last year!
Oh really? I only read a lot of articles when *** comes out~
Yes, you may not know right now because of the corona pandemic!
But why is there a sudden slump in employment?
This is also ultimately due to the unemployment caused by Corona, but the citizens are all blaming the president.
But I think the whole country can't help it because of Corona ㅜㅜ
Yes, but there is long-term employment and the recent withdrawal from Afghanistan has also caused a lot of decline in the number of transactions!
Oh yeah Afghanistan that was so shocking
That's right ㅜㅜ It hasn't been resolved yet ㅜ
Oh really? I thought it was resolved, but I guess not.
What, the US must have withdrawn too, the kids inside are just fighting each other now?
It's not even a mess, it's just~ Why are you like that?
So we brought the citizens from Afghanistan to our country.
Oh yeah I saw that one, the kids were so excited
Sister, why did you go to the dermatologist today?
I have a lot of sebum on my nose so I'm going to get an aqua peel!
Oh my gosh ㅜㅜ Is it true that Aquaphil hurts?
Aquaphil? It doesn't hurt at all?
Is this just refreshing?
Oh really? How much does that cost?
I just got a nose job today and got it for ten thousand won
Then, if you do it all together, you'll get about 100,000 won?
No no
It's only 20,000 won haha cheap
Wow, it's cheaper than I thought
I didn't even think about it because it hurts!
Aqua Peel is a low-irritation peeling product, so it’s cheap!
Do they do that at a skin care shop or at a hospital?
It's what dermatologists do! Just those therapists!
Then how many hours would it take to just do the nose?
It took about 20 minutes, Kiki
It'll be over soon!
Is it really effective?
When I got home, it was clean
Didn't your sister say she doesn't have a car?
Yeah, I don't have a car, but I'm looking into used cars today.
Wow, really? It's close to my sister's company!
But when I quit my job, I'll be driving around
I see. So you've never had a car accident?
There are two Kiki
I hit a convenience store with my ex-boyfriend's car
Oh my gosh, my boyfriend hit me with his car?
No, I hit him while I was driving.
Hey, unnie, you weren't hurt much?
Yeah, I wasn't hurt, but I was scared after that.
So, if you start from the beginning with a fear of ㅜㅜ, you'll get sick!
But the dog was drunk, so I had no choice but to do it.
Oh, I see ㅜㅜ
Sister, were there any aftereffects?
Yeah I didn't really have any
Driving is fun!
Thank goodness I didn't have any aftereffects ㅜ
Oh really? Aftereffects ㅠㅠ I have to overcome it
I did something really stupid,
What kind of stupid thing have you done?
When I ordered through the All Young app, they gave me a coupon for a nearby All Young branch?
Did Olive Young give you a coupon?
Yeah but?
But that coupon was a coupon that gave you a kit if you bought over 5,000 won?
Yeah, what can I buy for 5,000 won?
So I went there because I had something to buy, but I came back without exchanging the coupon.
Oh, so you just bought stuff?
Yeah, that's right, the things I bought were more expensive than I thought.
Then it's invalid?
Until when?
I don't know, but did they issue a smart receipt there?
Will that work?
Maybe you should go and check again?
Oh my gosh ㅜㅜ I really hope that works out, but it's first come first served!
I think it would be better to go at least once even though it's annoying ㅜㅜ
I'm lazy today, so I'll put it off until tomorrow!
Take some time tomorrow for lunch and go.
Unnie, have you listened to Espa's new song?
No, is that the dance you remember from Espa?
They're both wrong, it's a dud dance!
Oh really? Diggut Dance Kiki
I don't know many singers these days
So who is the newest singer you know?
The newest singer? Chungha? Or maybe...
Chungha? Do you like Chungha's songs?
Chungha's songs are addictive and her dance is addictive too
That's right, it looks even better when you watch it with the requested dance!
Oh right, I personally like Chungha better than Sunmi
Kiki I like the low and mid tones, Sunmi likes the high tones, and Chungha likes the low tones~
Oh, I admit it, I admit it
But why Espa?
Ah, a new song came out and I love it so much!
Did you know that SM is part of Espa?
Yeah, I know that, so your debut was awesome too.
They are currently saying that they are the girl group that will follow Girls' Generation!
Kiki, your dog's face is small and pretty.
Does your sister like reading comics?
I like watching TV better than reading comics.
So, you like animation, sister?
Yeah, you know Howl's Moving Castle?
Ha, of course I know~
I really like that!
I think I've seen that almost 10 times
Oh really? Do you remember the part where Howl said to the female protagonist that he had been looking for her for a long time?
Yeah I remember Kiki the male lead is awesome
That scene is connected to the last part!
Oh really? But when I see something like that, I feel excited
That's right, at the end, the female lead said to the male lead who turned into a monster that she would go find him! That part too!
Oh really? When I hear it like this, it feels new again
Right, and Howl, you know that Howl recipe, right?
Howl's formal? What is that?
Why is there so much I don't know?
Don't you know the scene where Kiki and Casper Bullo are eating bacon and eggs together?
Oh, you know that Kiki scene, you know that one
I noticed you were shopping for dinner tonight...
Who was watching you buy dinner?
There was a problem with that store, so the owner was very nervous.
Oh, did you order food from a store instead of the supermarket?
Hey, there's a cafe I often go to!
cafe?
It's a cafe, can you fix dinner there?
I bought it because the salad there was delicious!
Oh, why was that guy acting like that?
He complained that the taste was strange!
If the taste isn't good, just go somewhere else and don't come back.
But he said that he originally explained that it was that kind of taste, and that he would contact me if he was not feeling well.
Oh, but if you used spoiled ingredients, that would be expected
That's why the boss said he would take me to the hospital and pay for the treatment.
But you're not the one who doesn't take responsibility haha
So ㅜㅜ that place is really delicious!
Kiki, as long as you taste good, that's fine haha
Oppa, don't you plan on becoming independent?
I still don't think about independence Kiki
I see
What did your parents say they wouldn't do?
Yeah, he hasn't said anything yet, but he seems like he'll be upset if I leave?
Oh, right, Kiki
Is a house just a house?
Yeah, I'm just living in a house, Kiki.
If it's a normal house, there would be a garden, right?
I don't have one at home, but I'm raising one in front of the store. Kiki
Kiki Oh, are you being raised by your parents?
Yeah, it looks like you're doing this and that, Kiki
Do you know what's really delicious?
But sometimes I think it's better to buy it and eat it.
It's not Kiki~
That's a good thing~
Then do you know what to raise?
Um... There are potatoes, sweet potatoes, peppers, and everything else. Just Kiki.
Kiki Oh, I guess your parents like it when you raise stuff like that~
Yes, flowers and such are also planted and such, Kiki
Oppa, is there a car you want to change other than the one you have now?
I've always had a dream car!
As expected, men have dream cars in their hearts!
But if you look at it again, it always seems to change Kiki
Kiki So, what kind of child do you have in mind this year?
Do you know me as a trident?
I kind of like that, Kiki
Are you talking about that Maserati?
Kiki is right
It's really pretty so it's always on my list Kiki
Kiki, my friend rode that and he said it was really different from a regular car.
Yeah but she's famous for being a pretty piece of trash Kiki
Oh really?
But isn't it better than morning?
Of course, where are you comparing it to?
I'm upset, brother
Are you saying that Kiki's price isn't that great?
Yeah, I think it's a bit design-oriented, Kiki.
I heard that Maserati is best in red?
that's right?
Haven't you seen that matte one?
Matte is the truth
How long have you been working there, oppa?
I think I've been here for about 5 years now~
Wow, you went to the military and then went straight to work?
I've done this before and I'm always stuck here
Kiki: So you've been working there since you were little?
Yeah, that's right, I did it in other places too, but you can think of it as doing it here Kiki
Does your brother shave himself?
No, that's what dad is doing, Kiki
Oppa, you'll have to learn skills soon too, right?
I think I'll go here because the part-time job here is more trustworthy Kiki
Kiki: Then what does your brother do?
I serve and make the guests laugh~
Kiki, you were born with a sales background, weren't you?
No, but I don't think I'll be good at sales either.
Why are they both in the service industry!
Hey, it's just business, it's not the same as actually doing business Kiki
Have you ever been bullied while serving in the military?
Yeah, I wish you hadn't brought this up Kiki
An older brother I know was told to go into a cabinet, and when he went in, he got beaten up so badly.
There really are a lot of things like that
There are many cases where they put on gas masks and hit people.
Haha why are you doing that
But they said that's not the case now!
I heard that, but honestly, it's unfair and I'm annoyed Kiki
That's right ㅜㅜ If you look at DP, they say that it really happened ㅜㅜ
It was worse before that, even though it wasn't that great
If you endure it, you're Sergeant Lim, and if you don't endure it, you're Sergeant Yoon?
No, isn't that the opposite of what you said? Kiki
Kiki, I guess so
Both of them have bad endings though ㅜ
Yeah, I guess it would be better for my next child Kiki
At that time, I personally thought that a system of voluntary enlistment would be created.
I think it would be possible if the country treated you that well. Kiki
Yes, but people said they would continue to enlist as long as there was no end to the war with North Korea.
Yeah and this isn't America so it's impossible Kiki
How many certificates do you have, oppa?
I have a certificate.
Oh, someone who works all day has a certificate?
Have you ever heard of a driver's license? Kiki
Kiki Yeah, that's one of the qualifications Kiki
You can't get a job without it these days.
Kiki, that's amazing
Yeah, I felt that way too
You have to drive well wherever you go!
Kiki said that since this is a rural area, you can't get a job without a car.
That's right Kiki, without even giving me the money for gas!
So I'm going to pick up all the part-timers and take them home!
Kiki, really?
Where do you pick up all the part-time workers?
Because it's a operation, bring a lot of firewood from Gyeryong!
Wow, awesome Kiki
Then, do you have one, oppa?
Yeah, of course, if you're a man, you have to get a class 1 license, right?
Kiki I'm a confident woman too, so I have one!
What should I do!?
Oh, you're kind of cool.
I think I'll fall in love with Kiki
Your older brother said he's working in Seoul now!
Yeah, that's right
Why are you in Seoul?
Can you tell me what you do in Seoul?
My brother is also doing business there now, Kiki
Business? In Seoul?
You must have a lot of money!?
no
It's all loans Kiki
I'm running a beef restaurant
Kiki, really?
Where are you doing it? I want to go there sometime!
Oh really?
I'm doing it in Gangnam. Do you want to go?
Oh my, my company is close to Gangnam!?
okay?
So I have to do sales again?
Kiki, should we take our company people with us?
It's beef, but is it true that the company bought it for me?
I don't know, maybe there's a company card!
Of course I don't smell Kiki
That famous law card?
Cash payment is better
We're a small business, so we probably don't have a car insurance, right?
Why do you say that even small and medium-sized companies have their own laws? Kiki
How did you meet your older sister?
I saw it when I was playing with my dog friend~
I see. So that's where you fell in love at first sight~?
of course
Your looks are really outstanding ^^
Kiki Ah, I see~
You're so pretty~?
I think your reaction is a bit strange.
no
That's because I've never seen it before~
Then take a look
Even a woman might fall in love with Kiki
Kiki Okay, let me try again later~
Okay, I'll ask and try to make an appointment.
Kiki: Then shall we go on a double date?
Oh, that's good, isn't it?
My boyfriend is the same age as me.
Yeah~ but my boyfriend hides his face a lot haha
are you okay
I won't cover that up~
Kiki I'm okay too
I won't go either~
Then I'm the only one who feels uncomfortable~ Kiki
Oppa, you don't want to keep animals at home?
Yeah, we're overwhelmed with just one puppy in front of our house.
Where did you bring that kid from?
At some point I looked and it was there. It looks like my mom brought it haha
Kiki, really?
How old is the baby?
I honestly don't even know that kid's age~
Kiki, did you bring an adult dog?
No, I'm not really interested Kiki
Your brother doesn't like animals very much?
I'm scared of animals... very scared...
Oh my, Kiki, then you won't go to the zoo?
It doesn't really matter since everyone is locked up there~
Kiki, I see
Oppa, can you tell me why you're scared?
There's nothing like that, I think I'm just afraid of getting hurt Kiki
Oh, right, Kiki
Then how about a gentle snake?
If there was a dog like that, I'd think about it Kiki
Does your brother like fishing?
No, I don't do it. These days, my dad goes there every day. Kiki
Kiki, I heard it's squid season these days!
Are you going to catch that?
No, my dad caught a lot of hairtail, Kiki
Oh my god, you're catching hairtail with a fishing rod!?
But it's not that big, it's small haha
Then, are you going to go out on a boat and catch them?
I don't know because we haven't had a conversation about that~
Kiki, wild croaker must be really expensive!
Yeah, that's right
They say that, but I haven't tried it Kiki
Oh right
Honey, you said you don't like seafood, right?
Yeah, so I guess they just grab it and that's it, Kiki
Have you seen how big Kiki Galchi is?
It's not that long from Jeju Island, it's just the size? Kiki
You know what?
The large hairtail I saw in Jeju Island was from China.
Oh wow I had no idea
I feel betrayed
What game did you say you were playing at your house?
I play FIFA, LoL, and PUBG. Kiki
FIFA is a club where your older brother is the owner?
Yeah, that's right, I'm recruiting kids well, Kiki
Okay, then what kind of skin do you use in LoL?
Oh, isn't that something you have to pay for?
Oh no
I'm just talking about characters?
Yeah but I do a lot of things so I'm doing it all Kiki
Then, where do you often go among top, mid, and bottom?
Hey, if you're a man, you should definitely go to Mid ㅡㅡ
Kiki, I see
So how many hours does the game last?
I think I do it for almost 3 hours on weekdays Kiki
You say you do this every day after work for 3 hours?
Yes, I always do that except on the days I meet my lover. Kiki
Are you saying that FIFA, LoL, and Beg are all games like that?
No, I'm playing FIFA and playing PUBG or LoL.
Oppa, don't you want to try something like backpacking?
Yeah, I want to try it, but I think it's a little scary. Kiki
Kiki why do men have to have distribution!
Hey, shouldn't men be afraid?
But it's less risky than for women~
These days, even men have to be careful in this world!
Kiki, that's right lol
Are you scared, oppa?
I'm still a scaredy-cat in my mom's arms, Kiki
Kiki My cousin is a girl and she's not afraid so she often travels alone!
Oh, that's really cool.
I kind of want to be like that.
I traveled alone to Europe before the coronavirus outbreak!
Oh, that friend you mentioned who went on a trip and got a girlfriend?
Kiki, that's right
I got a boyfriend and lost my backpack
Kiki got robbed
Kiki: But isn't it okay to lose to that extent?
Kiki no,
There was a whole bunch of money for the AirPod camera,
Then that lover must have fed you, Kiki
That's cool~
I was completely drenched in sweat today!
Huh, was it hot there?
It's cold here
I wore long sleeves to work today and it was hot!
I was cold today even though I was wearing long sleeves.
Oh really?
I wasn't even wearing long sleeves or thick clothes!
I really thought it was winter here, Kiki
Kiki, really?
I heard it rained there yesterday, so I guess it got colder!?
It rained yesterday and today too Kiki
Oh really?
Did it rain a lot?
I think I've come this far enough.
Is it really autumn rain that comes like this?
I heard that a typhoon is coming~
Kiki, where is that typhoon coming from?
I don't know about that, I just hope it doesn't come Kiki
A typhoon comes even in the fall? Is this true?
I'm scared because my horse seems so cold ㅠㅠ
There are still a ton of cases of voice phishing damage!
That's right, these days you have to use your head to avoid getting hurt, Kiki.
That's right, this time someone got hurt 5 times in 6 days.
What? One person was hit like that all at once?
Oh right, but this guy is being treated so unfairly.
To that extent, it's not just unfair, it's stupid, right?...
Kiki I don't know
Do you know why this person was treated like this?
Too innocent
Why did he get treated like that?
The voice phishing perpetrator completely fooled this person!
Yeah, that's right
There was a movie about voice phishing. Have you seen it?
Kiki, huh? Is that the movie with Kim Moo-yeol and Byun Yo-han?
Yeah, that's right. When I see that, I get really fooled and fall for it. Kiki
That's right ㅜㅜ And the person I mentioned was even charged as the perpetrator.
Wow, that seems too serious... Why are you doing that? ㅠㅠ
Yeah, that voice phishing perpetrator used this person as a delivery person.
Wow, I don't know anything ㅠㅠ I feel so wronged ㅠㅠ
Now, by 2050, there will be a catastrophe!
What is Daejaang?
50 years is 29 years later, what kind of disaster is it?
5 billion people will feel thirsty due to lack of water.
So how are we supposed to get water now?
Is that because there is no water and you can't get it?
No, shouldn't we come up with some kind of solution?
But this is something that scientists all over the world still can't solve ㅜㅜ
Oh, so does that mean we have to bring it from another planet?
If there's water on that planet, you could bring it, right?
Isn't Mercury a planet with a lot of water?
But they said that the water there was not drinkable.
I think we need to get supplies from somewhere ㅠㅠ
I need to gather some water now
Yes, there is another problem. The desertification rate of the Sahara Desert is increasing, so the surrounding countries are also becoming desertified.
Oh really?
But I don't think it will have any effect on our country...
Won't our country also be affected someday?
By then I'll be underground so it's okay
Have you ever bleached your hair, oppa?
I dye my hair very often Kiki
What dye?
Are you sure you're dyeing your hair blue?
I'm just coloring it, but my girlfriend doesn't like it so I can't do it now Kiki
Kiki, why did you wear that color before!?
Kiki just did a lot of brown and red ones
But isn't that a bit too gangster-like a color?
Yeah, that's why I hate it
I can't do it now Kiki
Yeah, black is better!
Or how about ash blonde?
Ash, I heard you have to bleach your hair to do that?
That's right, men with short hair can do it quickly!
Then should I ask permission and do it?
Yeah, but how much are you thinking about the price?
If you listen, you might be able to do it for 100,000 won~
Hmm, take at least 200,000 won with you!
What's on your head?
I just don't want to do it Kiki
Oppa, you had that car accident back then!
Why do you keep bringing up my accident! Why!
Kiki, no, my brother was riding in the car at that time and he crashed into me there.
Yeah, I got really pissed off there ㅠ
So your back was okay back then?
Yeah my back was fine but my car wasn't okay Kiki
Oh my gosh ㅜㅜ But even so, the aftereffects will come later, even if it's late!
They say it's not coming out right now ㅠㅠ I still can't feel it Kiki
Have you taken off the diagnosis?
I got a medical certificate when I first had the accident, but I didn't get anything else done?
Thank goodness I have to get the diagnosis first for later!
Oh, but the agreement has already been reached, so it's useless, right?
Oh my, how much did you get in settlement money?
I can only get 1.5 million won Kiki
Oh, I heard that these days, 150 is considered a lot?
Oh, is that so?
But it's a bit unfair, Kiki
I bought some clothes again this time~
Is it because of the weather these days? Everyone is shopping Kiki
Kiki, that's right, I even bought it in the evening and it was delivered this morning~
Wow, you're that famous city Coupang girl?
No~
Do you know about Brandy's dawn delivery?
no
I think this is my first time hearing this?
Kiki, this is a popular app among girls these days~
Can you deliver it quickly even in the countryside?
You can do Kiki, but then your choices will be limited?
What? In the end, only the city benefits.
Kiki, I can't help it
Because Seoul people order it the most!
I guess I'll just do some online shopping instead of using apps Kiki
Kiki, isn't there an app that delivers men this quickly?
I don't think I've ever heard of something like that~
Kiki Then just shop online and wait 3 days~
No, my girlfriend will buy it for me.
I'm waiting for that Kiki
Oppa, which male or female celebrity do you like the most?
I always like Han Ji Min Kiki
Kiki Han Ji-min!~?
I saw it on Nahonsan recently and it's really pretty ㅜ
Did it come out recently?
I saw the one that came out last time, Kiki
No, I saw the episode with Han Hye-yeon Kiki
Oh, is that the designer who made the clothes?
Kiki, that's right, that person can't come out anymore,
Did something happen to that person?
Yeah, they said it was my money, but it was all just advertisements.
Oh, you did some back advertising, Kiki
That's why they advertise in front these days, Kiki
Kiki, that's right, it's funny that you're openly saying PPL!
I'm going to get cursed at for back advertisements~ So I'm putting up front advertisements Kiki
Kiki admits
By the way, why are Han Ji-min's eyes so pretty?
There is nothing that is not pretty about dogs. Why is that?
No, your eye color is different from that of a normal person!
So, she's a special, pretty goddess.
I watched Uncle Kiki on Netflix after a long time and it was still fun
Oh, sir, do you like movies?
Hey guys, aren't you guys crazy about this movie?
Yeah, that's why I was thinking about shaving my head too, Kiki
Kiki: Um, just do whatever your girlfriend tells you to do~
Oh, then my opinion will never be there, Kiki
Kiki Then then your girlfriend is treating you so well right now!
Kiki, sometimes I want to do something different too
Kiki, no, oppa, what you've done so far has been a deviation, and from now on, you'll just live as your girlfriend tells you to.
Have you looked at my whole life?
I know too well
Kiki and that person is Won Bin,
What do I lack compared to Won Bin?
Everything, everything, everything is not enough!
no?
I don't lack anything except money!
Kiki and her confidence seem to be higher than Won Bin's!
Then I can eat and live with confidence alone Kiki
What is your favorite food?
I like french fries the best haha
okay?
Is that your favorite food in the world?
Yeah people might say that but I like french fries the best
Kiki: Don't you usually talk about home-cooked meals like your mom's?
Oh really?
You say that? Haha
Kiki No, I like tripe the best too
What the~ Kiki
I've never eaten tripe
Kiki, really?
Your girlfriend is probably a tripe fanatic?
Yes, I heard that
We haven't eaten together yet
Kiki, really?
When are you meeting your girlfriend?
I decided to go eat meat this weekend.
Oh my goodness, then instead of meat, eat tripe!
okay
Then, shall we give it a try?
Kiki, you won't regret it, it's so delicious!
Okay~ Kiki
I'll try Gopchang
What is the structure of your house?
My house has three rooms, one living room, one kitchen, and one bathroom.
You said there are three people living in your house?
Yeah, let's each live in our own room haha
Kiki and Daebak, do your parents write separately too?
Yeah, it's easier when you get older Kiki
Kiki, is it because one of you is snoring?
No, actually, it's because our commuting times are so different ㅠㅠ
Oh, I see ㅜㅜ
Then there's nothing I can do
They said that each room was comfortable because they moved almost in the opposite direction.
Oh, I see ㅜㅜ
Then where does the cat sleep?
If you just leave the door open, the cat will find somewhere to sleep.
Isn't Kiki Oh Kitty just so cute?
Right? Haha
I didn't decide to sleep that way
Kiki is a free cat
Our Obok sleeps with us
Oh Bok-yi seems to be very cute
We just each figure it out on our own
You said you were going to buy a car this time. What are you going to buy?
I'm looking into used cars right now.
Oh really?
Have you decided on a car model?
I'm probably going to choose one from the mid-size class!
So you're looking at the Avante as being on the same level as the Sonata?
Yeah but I'm having a hard time deciding between the Avante and the K3
Oh but I personally recommend the Avante
Avante?
This time the design is pretty and good Kiki
Yeah, it's time for it to come out used, so take a look.
Right Kiki
I'm also going to go to a used car dealership
Kiki's expected price is something you have to pull out and go
My maximum value is about 10 to 15 million won.
Oh, even the one from two years ago probably wouldn't have been that bad.
Right... I guess I should compromise on the options and buy the cheaper one.
Option angtrang handt is a must have
That's a must
I need a ventilation seat too
How long have you been working?
I did it right after I graduated from high school
I see, but you went to the military and came back.
Yeah, then I think it's about a year!
But does the company there wait for the military?
Yeah Kiki, you'll have to wait for the military to take me~
Kiki Oh, this is also the vanity of men~
Hey Kiki, it's been a while since I've been back to work so I still can't get used to it
Don't worry, just take it slow and you'll get the hang of it~
That's right, how were you when you first got reinstated?
Kiki I've never been reinstated?
Oh sorry, I guess I got confused ㅠㅠ
Kiki I quit my job and got a job somewhere else right away!
Oh, that's right. You resigned, not got reinstated.
Kiki, I don't even want to think about the place I quit.
Oh my, is that it?
I have to work hard too
Was your army stew tasty?
No way...
It doesn't fit at all
Kiki, you didn't eat anything that was delicious?
I liked the sausage stir-fry the best
Kiki, no one can keep up with processed meats
Yeah, and sometimes the boiled pork was also delicious.
Kiki, there must be some kids who don't like drowning fish!
Is that so...
I think it's really delicious when you dip boiled pork in ssamjang.
Kiki Ah then I totally admit it
Don't they grill things like meat there?
Yeah, but sometimes we have a pork belly party as an event.
Oh really?
Is there such a thing?
Yeah Kiki, once a year? Armed Forces Day!
I see
Armed Forces Day was pig slaughter day.
In the military, yeah Kiki
Because it's the event day
Then will you let me drink beer then?
Yeah Kiki but the limit is 1 can per person
Don't you study English or something?
Of course not
I have to take the TOEIC test...
Wow, you don't have to see it since you already have a job, right?
I'm just going to take the test for my career haha
Kiki, but doesn't that score disappear later?
It has an expiration date so I'm trying again now because it's expired...
So Kiki
You have to do that consistently
You said you gave up on studying English, right?
Kiki: I'm not studying English, I'm studying Japanese?
Japanese?
I found Japanese much more difficult.
I find Japanese more interesting than English
But isn't it difficult and incomprehensible?
No, I do better when I watch cartoons
Ah, Kiki, there are a lot of Japanese anime!
Kiki is right
I want to watch anime without even looking at the subtitles!
If I fail TOEIC, I should try Japanese.
What do your parents do?
My mother is a housewife and my father is just an office worker haha
Oh, that's right, us too Kiki
But next year my dad will retire.
Oh really?
So, do you have any plans for the future?
You're saying that now you only plan to play?
Oh, you've worked hard, so now it's time to have fun!
Kiki is right
So we told them to play
You must be making a lot of money now, right?
Kiki is right,
My sister and I, who are young blood, need to earn money.
Right, now your parents need to get some rest.
So now I bought a camper van and I'm going out for fun.
Oh my, I'm jealous
Then please invite me too, right?
I don't know Kiki
Camping car I didn't even tell my mom~
Are you the only one who knows?
I'm jealous ㅠㅠ
Kiki, no, only mom doesn't know
Ah, Kiki, this is a surprise for Mom without her knowing!
Do you like a daughter or a son?
If I had to pick, I'd pick my daughter! Haha
Kiki I like my daughter too
But I'm not going to have a child
Oh really?
Is that what they call the DINK tribe these days?
Kiki is right
I like babies, but I don't have the confidence to raise them.
Well, raising a child isn't usually easy.
Kiki is right
It's hard for me to even build my body,
I heard you can live well without a child.
Kiki That's right, these days it's trendy to live well without children.
It's hard because house prices are rising and the cost of living is expensive ㅠㅠ
Kiki is right
Hey, I don't think I'll ever be able to live at home.
Of course, couples buy houses by borrowing money together~
Kiki is right
But I guess it won't work even if I borrow money?
Why? Kiki
Have you saved up a lot of money?
Kiki No, I don't have any money so that's why
Oh, right, Kiki
I thought you were serious again
What is your cat's name?
What's our cat's name?
Nariya Kiki
Oh really?
Did you name it?
no
My mom named me Nari
Oh, does your mom really love cats?
You pretend to dislike it but you like it?~ Kiki
Kiki's mother also has a bit of a tsundere personality?
I guess so Kiki
My back is bent because of the cat these days
Kiki But if you have dependents, money really goes out quickly.
So I don't know why cats aren't covered by insurance ㅠㅠ
No, I have insurance, but it's not working
Oh really?
Even with insurance, is it really that bad?
Yeah, yeah, there is insurance now. Look it up!
Okay Kiki
Still, it's better to have insurance to feel safe
Kiki, you probably thought you should just look at insurance products and save up, right?
okay?
I guess I should open a cat savings account haha
Don't you like sports like basketball?
Of course I like basketball
Kiki, really?
Do you like basketball more than soccer?
No, I like soccer much better haha
I see
Have you played basketball recently?
Maybe I should go to the basketball court this weekend?
Kiki, really?
Who are you going with?
I'm going to call all the middle school kids
Kiki Oh, are you calling everyone you know?
I'm trying to contact the kids who used to like basketball
I see
How many hours are you going to spend with the kids?
The time hasn't been set yet, but maybe 1~2 hours?
Kiki, on a day like today, you'll be drenched in sweat, right?
There's a basketball court indoors, so it'll be okay, right?~
Oh, are you renting an indoor basketball court to play at?
Yeah, I like it because they even turn on the air conditioning inside haha
What games do you like besides begging?
Why is Bag excluded? Kiki
I like bags
How about doing it with me instead of Kiki Bag?
Sudden?
Oh, you can do it too? Kiki
I didn't know
Kiki, I'm a good shooter~
Have you heard of Sangtan?
I'm a master at that!
What is Kiki Santa?
I'm actually a sudden superman
It's a fancy word for catching bullet recoil~
Kiki whale?
What is your winning percentage?
The winning percentage is team luck and the kill/death ratio is over 60%.
Wow, that's crazy, 60% win rate,
Are you human?
how is it?
I'm a total newbie~
Kiki, what level are you now?
Five star vice-captain Kiki
Ranking up!
Kiki, Vice Marshal,? Sky Lantern,?
Is that all you did after eating?
I've been doing this since elementary school, so I guess I have a high class haha
Can you tell me what you did for fun in Seoul?
When I go to Seoul, I always go to Hongdae and the Han River.
Ah, the Han River is nice
I also pass by the Han River on my way home from work!
okay?
I like walking along the Han River.
I'd be happy to just drink a can of beer by the Han River and then go home.
Oh so romantic
I'm jealous of you living in Seoul ㅠㅠ
Kiki But it took me 2 hours to get home from work
Oh my it's too far Kiki
What do you like best about Seoul?
I still think the Han River is the best
Ramen eaten by the Han River is so delicious
Oh, that's delicious too, but I've never tried it alone.
Wow, you still have a long way to go before you can eat this alone
Kiki, can you eat alone?
Of course Kiki
Or do you want to go to the Han River together next time?
Yeah, okay
Bring your girlfriend toojavascript:fn_complete();
Okay, then let's all go to the Han River together.
Do you know it's already dark outside?
Really? Kiki
It's still bright here
It's pitch dark here now
Oh my gosh, it's already that time?
Oh, it's just dark
I'm screwed,
The sun sets early there.
It's getting boring here now
Kiki ha, it seems like it's been a while since I've seen you.
If you want to see the stars, you have to go to the countryside~ haha
that's right
Our house looks really good
Are you talking about the roof of your house? Kiki
Are you just talking about the area around my house?
Oh really? Kiki
It's been so long since I've seen stars
This can only be seen well when the surroundings are dark
And it's visible because there are no buildings nearby.
Kiki is right
Seoul has too many neon signs
That's right, our neighborhood is like that too, so we can't see any stars.
Wow, volleyball player Da-young Lee is really a mess
why?
Are you talking about those twin sisters?
Oh right
Did you know this guy was married?
Oh really?
Wasn't it solo? Kiki
Oh, no
Should I tell you what's really awesome?
What is it? I'm suddenly curious!
Let me know haha
Kiki, you got married right after studying for 3 months
And then a super fast divorce
Isn't it too fast?
Dating for 3 months and then getting married?
So, no, you can have a short relationship and stuff, but you can't get a divorce.
Oh my god, what did you say?
Are you getting a divorce already?
Kiki, I'm in the middle of a divorce.
Kiki, I heard your husband is going to a psychiatrist because of this.
I think that if you get married too quickly, there will be a lot of problems.
So she said she stabbed her husband with a knife
Wow, that's too much?
That's why you shouldn't get married hastily
Yeah ㅜㅜ
Player Da-young Lee loves knives so much
You have to be careful, Kiki
I get scared when I see articles like that
Oh, Moderna is causing a stir this time.
Huh? I got Moderna, what happened?
Moderna sold its vaccines to poor countries at high prices.
Wow, shouldn't we sell it cheaper to poor countries?
So, that's what it should be like, but ethically,
Yeah, but you sold it for more?
Well, developed countries get 19.5 dollars, poor countries get 28.5 dollars.
This is really too much
That's crossing the line...
So then you have to tell me the standard.
He said he couldn't say that
After all, it's a company, so money is more important than vaccination~
Kiki is getting a lot of flak right now
Deserves to be reprimanded
The whole world is in chaos, but why at this time...
So, Moderna's image is good because the quality of the vaccine is good.
Why is there such controversy now of all times?
But Moderna's quality is so good that it'll probably end with an article like this
Oh, it'll end up like that after wrapping it up ㅠㅠ
How many kilograms have you lost through dieting?
I'm on a diet right now haha
About 4 kilos?
Oh really?
Are you thinking of taking out more?
Yeah, I'm still not at my normal weight ㅠㅠ
Are you overweight now?
Yeah, I'm shocked that you're a little overweight
Wow, really?
Did you do that at the gym?
Yeah Kiki, so I'm going to try dieting seriously.
I want to do that too, but I don't have time
This diet can also be controlled through diet.
I'm maintaining my weight since I only eat one meal a day anyway ㅜ
Instead of maintaining it, how about we take it out together?
Kiki I have to work out because I have a body that needs to gain muscle.
okay?
You're the complete opposite of me, ㅠㅠ?
Hey I need to gain 7kg of muscle,
Wow, it's going to take a long time to gain 7kg of muscle.
Have you tried almond breeze?
Huh? Isn't that like soy milk?
Oh right
Have you tried this unsweetened flavor?
What does unsweet taste like?
I don't know haha
There's no sugar at all!
Oh really?
If there is no sugar, it won't taste good.
But I like it better without sugar
Then it's perfect for you
Isn't that right?~
Oh right
I mix this with oatmeal and eat it!
Oh really? Kiki
If you put that in oatmeal, it's a good combination...
It's not Kiki
It's really delicious
It's like a snack
Tell me the recipe
I'll try it once
Kiki, I just mix oatmeal with almond breeze and eat it!
Oh really?
Do things like ratios really matter?
Kiki, this is oatmeal in a jar, so just add one Almond Breeze and you're done!
Oh, I see
Then I'll give it a try~
I went to Carrot Market to trade!
Oh really?
Did you do a neighborhood transaction?
Oh, but it's not my neighborhood, it's 15 minutes away!
Oh, so you can search other neighborhoods too? Haha
Well, I think it's traded from the people around me first.
Aha! How do the items look?
It's food so the expiration date is fine!
I see
What did you buy at Carrot Market?
I bought a lot of curry retort food this time!
Oh, did you buy that at Carrot Market? Kiki
Oh right, it was originally 3,000 won, but they're selling it for 1,000 won each!
As expected, they say Carrot Market is cheap, and that is true.
Kiki, since it's used, I should sell it cheap.
How are you guys contacting each other?
A lot of people will come, right?
Well, it depends on what you upload!
I'll probably try selling used shoes or clothes!
Do you know the drama that's going on these days called Get Village Cha Cha Cha?
Oh, of course I know!
I'm a fan of that
Oh really?
Isn't Seonho really handsome?
That's right, I watch dramas to see Shin Min-a~
Kiki, that's right
You are Shin Min-ah and I am Seon-ho~
But the story development was actually pretty good, wasn't it?
Kiki, that's right
Shin Min-a is a dentist~
Should I say it's a meeting between a doctor and a multi-talented man? Haha
Kiki is right
Seonho, I found out that you are a graduate of Seoul National University~
Isn't that a complete reversal?!
Yeah Kiki
There was a reason he was an all-rounder in that town~
He was kind and gentle to people too! Kiki
The more I look at it, the more attractive it is
Kiki is right
But he looks kind from the start~
So, he's handsome and talented, Kim Seon-ho is the best~
Kiki is right
But it really suits Shin Min-a well ㅜ
Yeah, I think they're a really handsome couple, just like in the drama haha
What was the most enjoyable movie you saw this year?
If I had to choose, I think Fast &amp; Furious is the most fun!
Isn't Fast &amp; Furious a series?
Yeah, that's right, there was a new series released this year, Kiki.
Oh really?
What was the gist of it?
That feeling where the good kid and the bad kid join hands and beat up the bad kids?
Kiki laugh
Who is the male lead?
Do you know Dwayne Johnson?
That actor who appears as The Rock in WWE!
Oh, I know that guy!
What is the Fast &amp; Furious rating!?
It'll probably be around 8 or 9 points.
But I give it a perfect 10!
Wow, this is awesome
I have to watch it on Naver Movies!
Yeah, I definitely recommend Kiki
You won't regret it if you see it
Kiki Oki
Wouldn't it be more fun to see it in 4D?
But now they don't do it in movie theaters anymore ㅠㅠ
Kiki ah right
It must be over already ㅜ
Yeah, I guess I'll just watch it again at home~
I had jjambbong for lunch today~
I also wanted to eat jjambbong today ㅜㅜ
Was it delicious?
OMG! Why didn't you eat it!
We are so delicious!
Spicy jjambbong tastes good, Kiki
that's right
Ah, I ate jjamppong, not jjamppong rice!
Jjamppong or Jjamppong rice, if the soup is tasty, that's fine Kiki
that's right
But I like jjamppong rice better. What about you, sister?
Why? I like cotton more haha
Jjamppong rice also has noodles, dangmyeon!
I prefer slurp noodles over dangmyeon
Kiki I always have rice for lunch
Koreans are good at cooking!
I need to eat carbohydrates to have energy in the afternoon ㅜㅜ
Kiki is right
I'm in Seoul and Jjamppong rice costs 7,000 won. Is that a good price?
It's worth eating for 7,000 won.
It's almost full these days
Yeah Kiki
The house right next door is 9 thousand won!
Then the place you ate at will be good, Kiki
Sister, don't you find it inconvenient to live alone?
When you're sick and want to go out and play? When that happens
Does your sister like to go out and play with her friends?
no
If you tell me to just play, I'll just play.
But it's really sad to be alone when you're sick ㅜ
Yes, I said I was going to shower with tears that day. Kiki
ㅜㅜ Right? Have you been sick recently?
I recently had surgery and was in pain for about a month.
Oh my gosh ㅜㅜ I must have really shed tears ㅜ
Yeah but I'm fine now that I'm fully recovered Kiki
I'm so glad
Still, I'm glad my sister has a cat!
Yeah, the dog does give me a lot of strength
Kiki, there's no place to bring a pet in our house ㅜ
Why is it so narrow?
Is it because you live alone?
Yeah, that's right
And the house below is smoking and the smell is no joke!
Oh, we also smoke a lot in the parking lot
Sister, I told you I saw a used car!
Yeah, I looked into the prices of used cars.
Are you looking at the car type?
Yeah I'm going to buy a k5~
How many years have you been looking at that?
I'm looking at models that are 15-18 years old, and there are some that are cheap.
That's pretty good!
What is the average price?
Almost average price is over 800?
Really? It's cheaper than you think!
It's K5!?
Yeah, I guess it's the difference in options
There are so many cars these days
Did you know that the heated seats must be included in the sister options?
I don't know ㅜㅜ
There has to be a hot wire, absolutely
I haven't put my boyfriend in a hot spring for 4 years and I'm regretting it!
Then what do you do in the winter when it's cold...
Kiki, just do it with your hands shaking!
Still, it's amazing, seeing as it's been 4 years
I also worked part-time at a Chinese restaurant!
Oh really?
What did you do?
We were a family that did a lot of takeout rather than delivery!
Ah, it's hard to wrap it when packing.
Oh, the boss did all that stuff~
Then what did part-time workers mainly do?
I think I wrapped it with a rubber band and tied it with a serving band.
Do you admit that Chinese restaurants secretly have a lot of truths? 0
Oh, seriously, I admit it!
But luckily, our family had a lot of regulars at this store!
When a regular is scary, it's really scary
Oh really?
Have you ever had that happen?
Yeah, there are a lot of cases where people make mistakes in their calculations and end up crying and stuff like that.
Wow ㅜㅜ Is it true that he drank a lot of alcohol and caused trouble?
It seems like there is a truth wherever alcohol is sold
Oh my gosh ㅜㅜ Did that person come to the store again and eat?
There are so many truths, so many, so many, so many~
I went to visit a younger sibling I know.
Where were you in the area? Interview
He was in the unit in Jochiwon!
Ah, if it's Jochiwon, it's okay because it has a station.
Oh right
Kiki, I bought chicken because you said you wanted to eat chicken.
Wow, you can't even eat chicken in there?
Right ㅜㅜ There's only PX there!
Oh, that was before things like vacation came out.
Yeah, I just went for an interview with a friend!
But secretly, soldiers eat a lot of chicken.
Kiki, they go crazy over chicken and pizza~
Well, there are a lot of other foods too.
Kiki is right
Don't you feel like eating something like pig's feet?
Oh, pig's feet are okay too
But I guess you're craving something oily
Kiki, that's right, they always serve healthy food there ^^
They say there are a lot of bean sprouts and tofu.
Sister, you said you have a Chinese character certificate!
Yeah but it was different in the past so now it's just the basics?
Oh, then do you know how to measure the sky, unnie?
Of course I can read that much
I can press the sword to the limit of my knowledge!
Oh really?
But Chinese characters almost all look similar
Right. Sister, do you know the comic book called Magic Thousand Character Classic?
I think I've heard the Magic Thousand Character Classic somewhere before
It's a comic book, but I learned Chinese characters by reading it Kiki
Oh really?
I think I saw that too
This came out when I was in elementary school. My sister doesn't know!
I didn't see that and was at eye level
Oh my, Kiki, you really are a person with a good eye for detail!
The eye level and Kumon were exactly the same
My Kumon teacher gave me candy and told me to study, Kiki
Giving me candy?
You were a good teacher, Kiki
How old is your younger brother now?
My younger brother was in his third year of high school and was very sensitive.
Oh, Kiki, are you going to take the CSAT this time?
He said he was taking the CSAT, but it looks like he already applied for early admission
So the results aren't out yet?
Yeah, I heard they're still interviewing and stuff
I see. So if you get into the university through early admissions, you don't have to take the CSAT?
No, he said he just watched it because his school gave him financial support.
So the school you applied to was the one your younger sibling wanted?
I think I've used almost all the nearby national universities
Wow, I heard that if you go to a national university, you are being filial to your parents?
Yeah, that's right, but dogs only go to the military for one semester.
Ah, Kiki, that's right, I said it's better to get hit first!
The dog is crazy about body building right now.
Kiki, why are you going to the military when you're already going to be made anyway? Kiki
It seems like they are making a fuss about preparing for a fire.
Have you ever fought with your boyfriend?
Yeah, we fought when we went on a trip too, Kiki
You said you went on a trip this time, right?
Yeah, we fought even while traveling
Huh!? What's going on!
Let's talk right now~
We just clashed because we didn't agree with each other.
But when traveling, if there's even one thing that doesn't match up with each other, we fight.
Yeah but it was my first trip with my boyfriend
Oh my, we've been dating for two years and this is our first trip together?
The dog is a firefighter, so he doesn't go out much because of the coronavirus.
Ah, then I guess there's nothing I can do about it ㅜㅜ
How about a camping trip then?
Camping? I went glamping recently too.
My friend is a career soldier and because of Corona, he bought camping gear!
Yeah, a lot of guys go there these days.
That's right, my girlfriend likes camping too, so now we're a camping couple!
There are quite a few camping couples, Kiki the Camper
My sister said she's raising a cat right now, right?
Yeah, I live with one.
What about the cat breed?
Munchkin dad is a ragdoll mom is a munchkin
Oh right
That's what I said!
Where did you bring it from?
I got a home allotment in Daejeon!
How did you find out about the home sale and go and get it?
I found the blog, signed up, and brought it here.
Oh, is that Naver Cafe?
Oh right
Naver Cafe Ya Kiki
I upgraded my Naver Cafe
It's admirable that you went to the trouble of upgrading yourself just to bring Kiki baby!
But at that time, it was a bit of an impulse
Oh, was that because you were so lonely back then?
Rather than something like that, just my romance?
If you live alone, there are things like that, why~
I think I know what Kiki is
But it's good that we live together, right?
It was so much better than I thought. Nyangnyangi is the best.
Sister, do you have a yoga mat at home?
Yeah, of course I have a yoga mat!
Do you know what material that is?
no
I don't know the material, but isn't it rubber?
Does your cat like that yoga mat?
Oh right Kiki
If you avoid this, you'll be lying down for a long time
Kiki is lying down and doesn't she scratch herself?
I don't think I've ever seen anything scratched ㅜ
I smelled a lot
It wasn't just my cat!
My yoga mat is already tattered ㅜ
Why is that so
Cats don't knowㅜ
Yeah Kiki
I bought him a cat tower too, he loves boxes damn it!
I don't think my cat likes boxes.
I see
My cat comes up and lies down as soon as I put the mat on to exercise.
So how do you exercise?
Avoiding?
no
Roll him over and move him to the side~
Then won't it come up again? Kiki is cute
Sister, don't you like going to PC rooms?
There's a lot to eat these days
So I think it's okay to go
Kiki is right
Actually, I'm going to the PC room to eat too~
What do you usually eat?
Recommend me
First of all, the ramen is really delicious!
But there was a lot of food besides ramen.
Yeah Kiki
There, samgyeopsal kimchi fried rice is a must!
Oh, Sam Kim Bokkeum, it's delicious no matter where you eat it
Kiki is right
Sister, did you ever play arcade games when you were young?
Yeah, I went to the arcade a lot when I was in middle and high school.
Kiki, do you know that game where the dinosaur blows bubbles?
Oh, I think I've seen that somewhere, but I think I've done it before.
Was this called Bubble Bubble?
Don't you remember?
Oh right, I think it's Bubble Bubble Kiki
Kiki, I even beat this boss mob!
Oh wow, this is awesome Kiki
That's secretly difficult ㅜ
Sister, where did you say you went on this trip?
I recently went to Yeosu
Oh right!
It's really nice there ㅜㅜ
Any plans for your next trip?
I want to go to Jeju Island
I'm so sad about Yeosu
What month are you planning to go to Jeju Island?
If I go, I'll go once in the winter~
In winter, you should go see the camellia flowers in Jeju Island, right?
Oh really?
I've never been there in the winter
Camellia flowers bloom red in February and are really pretty!
Is it worth going to Jeju Island in winter? Recommended?
Jeju Island is a place you won’t regret visiting in any of the four seasons!
That's true
But this time you're going to Busan!
that's right
But I asked my boyfriend and he said he wants to go to Jeju Island~
Then I guess I have no choice but to go to Jeju Island
Kiki: That's why I wanted to go to Busan!
The same sea...
Let's follow our boyfriend's opinion
Sister, you said you were going out to drink today, right?
Yeah, I went out for a drink
Go get some fresh air
How was the weather in Daejeon today?
It was extremely hot during the day
I was wearing a hood and I was sweating
Oh my gosh ㅜㅜ Is this really the weather in mid-October!?
therefore
I can't even wear a leather jacket in the fall
Wow, I absolutely have to wear a leather jacket in the fall!?
therefore
Why is it so hot during the day?
So ㅜㅜ
I could have just worn short sleeves too!
that's right
But I think I should bring a coat for the evening
But in Seoul, you don't even need an outer garment at night.
It's so hot in Seoul ㅜㅜ
Is it because there are a lot of people?
that's right
I guess the temperature is a bit higher than other places because the population is so close together!
Hmm ㅠㅠ Especially the hell train seems even hotter and smells
Oh my gosh ㅜㅜ I really didn't want to think about summer,
I don't know the dust
I know because I've been there.
Sister, do you know the celebrity named Ham So-won?
You know, it was famous for a while.
that's right
It was even in the news! As a bad thing!
Oh really? Kiki
The dog will fall soon
It's already been a while since I've been through it,
Do you know why there's another article?
What is causing this?
If you look at the dog's Instagram, they're promoting it a lot.
that's right,
Ham So-yeon opened a shopping mall and did a lot of advertising, but that became a problem.
Celebrities secretly go to a lot of shopping malls, but it's causing problems.
that's right!
My sister is wearing a one-piece dress. Can I buy a dress just by looking at a picture of the dress that only shows the top?
no
Then isn't it a consultation?
The one piece should be exposed all the way down
She uploaded a picture of her face in the center and said she was selling a one-piece dress, but how much does it cost!?
Surely it won't be more than 100 thousand won?
The correct answer is 168,000 won!
A thousand pieces!
Why is the duty so expensive? -_-
They said it was custom made, but it looks like it's made in China. Kiki
Is it because I live with Chinese people? Why is that?
Sister, what computer are you using?
I'm using the one my dad bought for me, so I don't know about the dust.
Kiki, isn't that a big corporate brand?
Ah, I don't know if it's LG or Samsung.
It's one of two things
I'm so pissed off right now!
Why is it like that ㅜ ㅠ ㅜㅜ
I bought a used MacBook, but the MacBook Pro is coming out!
Oh, I also recently heard that my friend's MacBook was stolen...
If a new model had come out, I would have paid more and bought this!
Why did you pay so much for it?
I bought it used for 1 million won!
Wow, that must be so unfair ㅜㅜ
Is used ok?
Is it useful?
So ㅜㅜ
It's still usable, but I think a new one is better.
How much is the MacBook Pro?
Is the design pretty?
The design is undeniably Apple! It's pretty!
Apple seems to be all the same
Sister, do you have a perm right now?
No, I got a perm, but I cut it and cut it again and it's all gone
I'm wondering what to do with my hair right now!
Since it's fall, I recommend dyeing your hair haha
Dye your hair? What color should I use?
Isn't the brown color pretty?
I like that the best
But I tell people not to do it in brown!
Why for what reason?
If your face is pale, it might not suit you
Hmm~ your face is yellow~
So I guess brown doesn't suit you ㅜ
If it's yellow, brown is fine, but why Kiki?
I'm also a Hwangtomin
ㅜㅜ Lie!
I really don't fit in ㅜㅜ
Then how about getting a perm? I also recommend getting a perm.
I'm looking at hippie perms anyway!?
You're not planning on getting a hippie perm for your bangs, are you?
Why? Don't you have to do all of them?
It would be cute if you did that, but it would be hard to manage.
My sister said she had surgery, how did she get surgery?
I'm suffering from rhinitis and tonsillitis ㅠㅠ
Wow, your rhinitis was that bad?
Yeah I had a runny nose every night
Oh my gosh ㅜㅜ Do you perform rhinitis surgery under anesthesia?
Well, I did it under anesthesia
We did it together when we were going one way
What kind of surgery did you have on your tonsils?
I had a tonsillectomy because I still have tonsillitis!
Oh my god, they say that really hurts!?
Yeah, that really hurts and I have a really high fever.
ㅜㅜ Oh my god, how many hours did the surgery take?
I think it took about an hour, but I don't really remember. I was under general anesthesia.
Then you must have gone to a university hospital and done it?
Yes, I heard that it can only be done at university hospitals!
Then it must have been done at that famous hospital in Daejeon!
Do you know Chungnam National University? I did it there haha
Sister, did you apply for the mutual support fund this time?
Yeah I did that but when will it come out?
This October one will come out in November, and the November one will come out in December!
But I see that I spent almost 200, can I still receive it?
Sister, how much did you spend in the second quarter?
About three hundred and sixty for the first and second quarters combined?
No, you have to compare it to October based on the second quarter!
Oh really?
This gives me a headache ㅜㅜ
I just don't know
But you still applied, right?
Of course I applied
So I got a message via KakaoTalk saying that the application was completed.
Oh, so you applied through Kabang?
No, my main bank is our bank!
Did you come through KakaoTalk?
Oh really?
I applied as a citizen and just got a text message!
Either text or KakaoTalk, which one will come~=
Oh, right, Kiki
I wish November would come soon!
It's mid-month so time will pass quickly ㅜㅜ sigh
Sister, don't you like male singers other than Chungha?
The male singer is Lee Seok-hoon Kiki
I really like Lee Seok-hoon
Hey, Seok-Hoon-Ti, you're my love~
That guy is already married ㅜ Married
Oh, right,
I wish my husband looked like that,
I really do admit that
My wannabe is real
Sister, did you see what I said on What Do You Do When You Play?
Of course I saw it
I've been more in love since then
Me too ㅜㅜ I watched it with my friends and all four of us cried ㅜ
Why for what reason?
Did you cry while listening to the song?
Yeah, doesn't that bring back memories?
I wasn't crying, my heart was pounding
ㅜㅜ Actually, I was drinking at that time~
Maybe it's because you're drunk, Kiki
Kiki, there was something like that too~
When I drink alcohol, my emotions go wild
Sister, if you like Howl, you'll like the director's other works, right?
Chihiro? I've seen that a lot too!
Ah, it's Sen and Chihiro's Spirited Away, right?
that's right
That's right, the title is really long, Kiki
Kiki is right
But that's not a bathhouse, it was originally a brothel!
Wow, you're saying that's a reference to a red-light district? That's awesome.
that's right
But since it's for the kids to see, it's expressed as a bathhouse!
Oh, but at first glance, it looks like there are some women there
Yeah lol
But wasn't it a bit disgusting when that dad became a pig?
that's right
I was a little scared when I ate it like a dog or a pig
Yeah ㅜㅜ
But thanks to Haku, my eyes were purified~
Haku is handsome too
Why are you handsome even though you have short hair?
Yeah Kiki
Even though he looks much younger than me, I want to call him oppa~
If you're originally handsome, you're definitely my brother~
Kiki is right
He's handsome even when he turns into a dragon!
that's right
If you're handsome, everything is forgiven haha
Honey, do you like eating late-night snacks?
I like to eat, but I can't eat here in the countryside.
Kiki, aren't you going to Baemin there?
Ah, there's no Baemin here Kiki
Kiki, ah, Kiki, oppa, did you say you were going to buy Gayageum?
No, I live in Yeonsan, Kiki
Oh, then if I want to eat something, I have to go out?
Yeah, I have to go out or drive to the convenience store in front. Kiki
Oh, but there's a convenience store~?
Is it about a 3 minute ride?
Kiki, is this true? But convenience stores are doing well these days~
Yeah but it's hard to get there Kiki
Kiki, why is there a car? It's only a 3 minute drive!
But you know it's also annoying to have to go out and get in the car, right?
Kiki Ah, I admit, it's a forced diet after all.
Then why is Baemin popular but Kiki is annoying haha
Oppa, do you feel the heat easily?
no
I'm a bit cold, Kiki
I see
My boyfriend is freaking out from the heat!
Oh, I'm jealous
Wouldn't that be better?
So I'll buy you some bamboo shoots this summer!
Kiki, you don't wear your hair down and you hold it well?
Kiki, is this really a new world?
If that's cool, should I buy one for the summer?
But my brother says he catches the cold easily!
Hey, but it's not like that in the summer Kiki
Kiki, that's right
The wisdom of life from the elders of old is amazing, isn't it?
Kiki, do modern people have no wisdom these days?
Kiki: These days, modern people are circulators! You know?
Oh, I see
That was really cool Kiki
They say it's the icing on the cake if you turn this on with the air conditioner?
Even if you put ice on it and turn it on, it's no joke Kiki
Oppa, have you ever been on a plane?
Hey, do you think I'm some kind of caveman? Kiki
Kiki, why has my boyfriend never been on a plane!
Oh, he said he's never been to Jeju Island?
Kiki has never been to Jeju Island!!
Wow, what have you been doing?
I have to take it with me
I said let's go but the timing wasn't right!
You work all day, but you don't get sick?
Kiki is right
I can't use my vacation days until November.
Kiki, take some time for your boyfriend.
I was going to do that too, but my company is short on staff.
Oh, then you can go play after your surgery, Kiki.
Kiki, did you know that January is my birthday?
Oh, you want to go on a trip to celebrate your birthday? I'm so jealous.
So I'm just waiting for January and I'm shivering!
My lover will be waiting for that moment the most!
Are you still looking for part-time workers?
No, I don't buy it now, but I buy a lot in the summer Kiki
I'm a new server. Can I get a career position?
Oh, then do you want to come and work?
Kiki, if you were a kyungryuk, how much salary would you get?
We are paying 2 million won per month!
Oh, are you coming to give me a ride home too?
Isn't your house over there, Kiki?
Yeah Kiki
It's close to Yeonsan, right? You know what?
It's not close at all, you come by car Kiki
Kiki: So you're giving me tea?
If you give me money, I'll use the people in Nonsan city Kiki
Kiki Oki~ Okay, I'll just go eat Kiki
Okay, come as a guest and I'll give you some dumplings, Kiki.
Do you make that yourself?
No
I'm just serving Kiki
Oppa, what was the most delicious thing you ate in the military?
What I remember most is drinking cola during training camp.
Kiki Oh, did you know that I went to Nonsan Yukhun?
Oh, you worked there? Kiki
Oh, I used to work there!
Wow, what kind of part-time job did you do there?
I used to work at a cafe there!
I bet the soldiers saw a lot of that too?~
Ha, it was really hard
I wanted to run away,
Kiki, is business going really well there?
But it was ruined there,
Because of Corona, the kids can't use it,
You didn't go broke because you worked, did you?
no,
It will fail a year after I leave
Oh, then it's not you, Kiki
Corona is killing a lot of people haha
That's right, but it's not like everything is good just because I'm there~
Let's just end it by saying that corona was the problem Kiki
What subject did you like the most, oppa?
I liked computer time the most Kiki
Kiki, that must have been game time, not computer time~
Yeah so I waited for that time or music?
Kiki music?
Oppa, did you ever practice playing the guitar when you were a kid?
No, we sang in front, right? Kiki
Oh really?
It's hard to believe, but I'm singing A
Oh, that's hard to believe!
Kiki, seriously, even the kids were surprised by my croaky voice!
Ah, then I guess they'll just give me a grade. I should get an A too haha
No, right?
Am I the only one who got this?
Didn't you buy him something? Kiki
No, no~
I just showed off my true hidden skills!
I guess I should investigate the bribery, Kiki.
Kiki bribe? How old was I at that time~
Kiki, you're amazing, I'm giving you an A ㅠ
His ears are weird Kiki
Isn't your mom's birthday coming up soon?
Yeah, that's right, my birthday is coming up soon!
yes?
I remember~
What are you going to do!
Well, I haven't really thought about it yet.
What do you recommend?
First of all, the number one thing my parents consider is money!
Kiki, everyone really says that
Kiki, you must be getting old
Kiki is right
Try that tissue? It's trendy!
Oh, isn't that so boring?
Kiki, or maybe these days they put it inside cakes!
Isn't that already out of style?
It's out of style, but you've never done it before!
that's right
If you give it to me, I might like it again Kiki
Okay~
Oppa, how much are you thinking about?
Well, I don't think I can do that because there aren't many. Kiki
Kiki okay~
So, does your mom like wearing makeup?
no
These days, it seems like I just apply sunscreen!
Have you ever traveled abroad with your girlfriend?
I went with someone I met before, Kiki
I see
Where have you been?
I went to Kota Kinabalu and came back Kiki
Wow, where is Kota Kinabalu?
I don't know about that either, I was just led there Kiki
Kiki oh my gosh Kiki what were you doing there?
I just played in the pool and enjoyed my leisure time!
If you do that, they'll even take a picture for you.
Take a picture?
of course
I did that too and watched the sunset!
So where did you put all those collected photos?
I deleted that, Kiki
If my lover sees me now, I'll be in big trouble Kiki
Dirt ㅜㅜ It's tearing me apart
Is it not possible to lock it with a padlock?
I don't know, if I see this conversation, I'm in big trouble Kiki
Ahhh ㅜ I understand. I'll stop here. Hehe
Yeah, if I get caught again, it's time to break up.
Kiki, you have to be careful
Oppa, I'm going to shave my cat's hair.
Wow, that cat must be really stressed out?
Oh, I was supposed to do it during the holidays, but I couldn't do it this time.
Oh, so cats shed their fur twice a year?
no
Push once a year!
Ah, I saw Mina on Chuseok instead of Lunar New Year haha
Well, I bit my lip during Chuseok last year.
Instead of leaving it to the shop, you push it yourself?
Yeah, my sister is a hairdresser.
Oh right
Your sister was a hairdresser, Kiki, I forgot
Kiki is right
I got in trouble for helping my sister ㅜ
Is the older sister who was pushing okay?
of course
The face side was on my side,
Oh, I guess you did that on purpose. Kiki, be careful.
At that time, Oh Bok was pushing the butthole,
Oh, you're sensitive about your butt, Kiki
Didn't you say that you like soccer?
that's right
Of course every man likes Kiki
Kiki, there's a soccer club in Nonsan. Should I join?
no
I can't do it because I'm busy, but my friends are doing it Kiki
But you can't do it these days because of Corona?
But I think they do that sometimes because they have enough people?
Oh really?
I guess it's possible during the day!
no
No, it's not like that. I think it's done while observing the corona situation!
I see
Now that I'm fully vaccinated, I can do anything!
But if you tell me not to meet up again, I won't be able to do it ㅠㅠ
I guess so?
Don't you want to play soccer, oppa?
I also want to relax sometimes, but the conditions don't allow it ㅠㅠ
So you play FIFA at home?
Yeah, I'm satisfied with that, Kiki
Kiki, your belly fat is going to increase a lot~ Tsk tsk,
Kiki, you're already gaining a lot of weight right now
So you were playing FIFA today too?
No, I just turned on auto today to get some rest Kiki
What's the benefit of just turning on Kiki Auto?
If you go in and fill it for a few hours, you'll get an item zoom Kiki
Oh Kiki, really?
So what characters are there?
Character? Do you know Son Heung-min?
Oh my! Isn't that a totally rare character?
Should I consider it a rare character? ^^
I have a lot of things
Oh my gosh, Kiki oppa, did you do something crazy?
Kiki, I'm paying the monthly fee every month without fail
Wow, how much does Kiki cost a month?
I'm saving 100,000 won each time Kiki
Kiki, aren't you using all your salary there?
Kiki, but at least you have to do this to enjoy life haha
Kiki, that's right
There's nothing but grass around thereㅜ
that's right
You need to be good at computers to enjoy your hobbies Kiki
Oppa, I'm in serious trouble right now!
What's wrong with you?
Should I go to Busan or Jeju Island? I was debating and then go abroad.
I don't know how many years it will take to get married, and my boyfriend hasn't been on a plane yet. Kiki
Oh, right!
But both of them will take the plane!
Oh, are you just going to take a plane to Busan?
Yeah, that's cheaper and faster!
Well, it's my first time on a plane, so Jeju Island would be nice, right?
Is that so?
My brother said he's been to Busan!
Yeah, you can always go to Busan if you have more time, Kiki
Then, should I look into Jeju Island?
Then go there and tell me about that good Udo Island~
Kiki Oh good good!
Honey, have you ever tried being a haenyeo (female diver)?
No, I couldn't do it
I forgot and didn't make a reservation so I got scolded
Oh my gosh, your girlfriend said she was really looking forward to it!
that's right
So I almost missed the flight that day Kiki
It's a bit chilly in Seoul today!
Oh really?
Kiki, I think it's warmer today than yesterday.
Really? You said it was really cold yesterday!
Yesterday was just winter, padding each
Kiki what is this
We had perfect fall weather!
The weather is really going crazy ㅠㅠ It's so unpredictable
Kiki I guess so but it's going to rain again on Friday ㅜ
Wow, it's going to get really cold after that? Kiki
therefore
But I didn't bring padding from home ㅜ
Then I guess I'll have to pick one from there. Congratulations Kiki
My 7th anniversary is next week. If I ask you to buy it for me, will you give me a discount?
No
That's a lot better than asking for a luxury bag
Oh, okay, then when I try to persuade her, I have to say something like, &quot;I'm not asking her to buy me a luxury bag!&quot;
Okay then
If you say that, I'll buy you some padding~
Or luxury padding?~
Kiki, would you like to see that heart-flipped brand?
No
Don't you know Moooooongkol?
I should ask her to buy that for me~
Hey, did you see the chaos that the Red Cross caused this time?
Red Cross?
Isn't that a big company that donates? Kiki
Oh, that's right. They kept paying the salary to the employee who went to prison. Kiki
Hey, why did you go to jail?
Prison? Kiki got in through fraud. Isn't that awesome?
But why did you give that person a salary?
He kept giving it to me without even knowing that the guy was in jail!
Does that make sense?
Don't you manage your staff?
So now that the article came out, there's a fuss about it Kiki
Then, do you want to get back the money that person put in?
That one didn't come out, but do you know how much the total is?
If you've been here a long time, it'll probably cost quite a lot of money.
How much is Kiki?
Oh, that's right, they paid 74 million won a month for 14 months!
Wow, that guy's salary must have been really high?
So, he said that he went to court every month and had to appear in court!
I feel like people are embezzling the money they donated, Kiki
Hey, did you know that Louis Vuitton is making a bicycle?
Hey, why is there a bike there? Kiki
Oh, this time, there's a limited-time collaboration between Louis Vuitton and a bicycle company!
That bike performs pretty well, right?
Should I tell you the price first? I'm shivering.
Ah, it's scary to hear, Kiki
How much does that cost?
Oh, then oppa expected it lol
I'll do the up and down for you!
Well, then shall we start with 100 million? 100 million!
Kiki, wouldn't it be better to buy a car with 100 million won?
That's right, so I tried Kiki for 30 million won?
Kiki, are you a ghost?
Or do you like Louis Vuitton oppa?
Oh my god, did I just match the amount? Kiki
no
It came exactly the same 35 million won Kiki goosebumps
I had a feeling it would be something like that, Kiki
Kiki But looking at the bike rider photo, she looks pretty, right? Kiki
Oh, you're not buying it because you're crazy, are you Kiki?
Honey, are you getting braces right now?
no
Why am I so evenly distributed~
Is it because my brother's gums are visible?
What on earth are those gums that are so visible? Kiki
no
When you smile, your gums look like they're showing through your teeth, Kiki
Hey, Onami, isn't that a bit too much Kiki?
no
If we compare, then yes!
Ignoring Onami!?
no
That's not it Kiki
Why~
Why are you interested in orthodontics?
Kiki, my front teeth are rabbit front teeth ㅜㅜ
Oh, those kinds of people do do that
But isn't it going to pop out again?
Kiki, I'm worried about that too,
But this was also quite expensive,
that's right
Doesn't it cost about 300 to 500 to correct it?
Oh, but in the case of only correcting the front teeth, it's around 150.
Oh, then I guess I'll go in without getting kicked out Kiki
Oh, I didn't ask that, did I?
Ask me about the extraction...
But after the correction, all of this will fall out~
Oppa, didn't you wear glasses when you were in high school?
What are you talking about!
I wore glasses right why Kiki
Kiki, but you look better naked~
Well then, it would be better for anyone not to wear glasses, Kiki
Hmm? Sung Si-kyung and Lee Seok-hoon?,?
Wouldn't it be better if you wore glasses?
Ah, Mr. Lee Seok-hoon, glasses suit you well, he's cool~
So Kiki
Honey, what was your eyesight like?
I think I'll get 0.3 or 0.4? Kiki
Then, it's not like your daily life is inconvenient at all?
Yeah, so I just take it off except when I'm driving.
Kiki Oh I don't wear glasses even when I drive ^^
Oh, you have good eyesight ㅠㅠ I'm so jealous
no
I'm just like my brother, I'm going to the bathroom~
What? It's more surprising that no accidents occur Kiki
Kiki is right
I couldn't see the sign so I asked my friend Kiki
I'll definitely avoid you whenever I see your car Kiki
Oppa, what should I buy from Carrot Market?
no
I don't buy it, I always sell it
By the way, is there anyone who sells it around your house?
no
So I sold it around my girlfriend's house.
Is it true that Kiki's account is your brother's account?
Yeah, that's right
Just bring the certification and do it there
Oh, right, Kiki
What did you sell this time?
I sold all the pants this time Kiki
Oh, how much did you sell that pair of pants for?
I gave it to Kiki for 20,000 won on Chapter 7. He's really crazy~
Wow, you didn't completely give it to me?
that's right
But my aunt left it behind to sell it. Kiki
Kiki, what? Your aunt left it for you to sell, huh?
When I heard that they were doing carrots, they told me to sell them and gave them to Kiki.
Give me some pocket money Kiki
Wow, wow, isn't this the creative economy?
then
Sometimes I give them brand name clothes too. Kiki nice.
Oppa, do you happen to know Lee Yong-jin?
Yeah, I found out about Kiki because of GiantPink
Oh, then, oppa, are you watching Turkeys?
Oh, I've seen that come up as a meme sometimes, Kiki
Kiki, isn't that really funny?
I was eating meat with a certain woman and she was carrying me hard.
Oh, isn't that a comedian named Kiki Mirage?
Oh yeah right, that's right Kiki
That guy is so funny? Kiki
Kiki is right
That guy is why I got into Turkey! Kiki
Kiki, do you really think that Lee Yong-jin should give shares to that person?
Yeah Kiki
That's a YouTube broadcast, so people are cursing openly, Kiki
So I think it's more fun to watch Kiki
Hey Kiki, do you know who came out after Mr. Mirage?
no
I've only seen that episode once! Who is it?
I see
Kiki, a transgender came out as satire
Oh, satire?
I think I heard that guy from BJ Kiki
Oppa, you said you went on a date!?
I'm jealous! Oh my!
that's right
I saw Venom 2 today Kiki
The news is fast~
Oh, Venom 1 came out two years ago?
Well, I don't know when 1 came out? Kiki
They say Venom is best seen as a snack!?
Ah, I want to see it like that too ㅠㅠ
There's no place that shows it like that here ㅠㅠ
Oh my gosh, you saw it in Nonsan?
Yeah, maybe I should have just gone to Iksan and seen it?
If you're going to see it, you might as well see it properly ㅜ
Then should I just watch it again? Kiki
I guess you enjoyed the Kiki-Oh movie!?
Can I see it again?
Well, it was about an hour and a half? That's about it, so it wasn't boring!
Oh, the running time is shorter than I thought?
Yeah, that's right
So I was like, huh already? Kiki
Kiki, didn't you upload that half-assed photo?
It feels like they just took the picture in a hurry and released it Kiki
Little Mom, what did you do for dinner today?
I made chicken stew to eat with my little dad.
Wow, I want to eat the chicken stew that my grandmother made!
Yeah, it's trendy to make it with tripe.
Wow! Then you put tripe in there!?
Yeah, I saw it on YouTube and put it in~
Kiki Oh, this looks really delicious ㅜㅜ
Did you put potatoes in there too?
Yeah, I put in some old maple leaves and it was fine. It was spicy.
Wow, I ordered that last time, but I didn't need to order it!
Then~ I'll do it when you come to Suwon next time
Oh good!
I have to go out and play sometime soon!
Yeah, I'll make you your favorite japchae too~
Kiki oh good
How was the japchae I made last Chuseok?
It's delicious because you're good at cooking
Hahahaha, that's my skill~
Mom didn't help me at all!
Okay Kiki
Please make japchae for me next Seollal too
How to get rid of little mom mold?
I have to clean it with a mold remover ㅜㅜ
Where did it come from?
Phew, no, I only clean it once a week, but it keeps coming back!
Ah, where does mold usually grow?
There's so much in the bathroom ㅜ
It needs to be cleaned with a mold remover and dried thoroughly.
But I think it's because our bathroom is so humid!
that's right
It's good to ventilate often
Oh but when I open the window the smell of cigarettes comes up ㅜㅜ&quot;
Oh, it's a studio apartment, but you smoke in the house?
Hey! I told you not to smoke, but you keep smoking!
That won't do.
The smell is rising from below - -
therefore,
I hope the person living in that house gets out quickly!
It might be quicker for you to leave Kiki
Kiki is right
I won't be here long,
I know
Come out quickly and go to another house
Does little mom have a driver's license?
Oh, of course~
I know how to drive a car~
Oh really?
But I've never seen my little mom drive!
It's because my little dad always drags me around ㅜ
Kiki, little mom, don't you think you'll turn the car on?
Oh, I'm going to buy it soon anyway Kiki
Oh, you're planning to buy a car?
Yeah, the car I'm going to ride with my daughter is small.
Oh really?
First of all, are you buying a car to ride together?
Yeah, Kiki, the two of you will split it and drag it around.
Kiki Oh, first of all, you must be saving up money hard right now!
Yeah I think so Kiki
Buy a small SUV
Kiki Oh, Daebak, have you thought about what kind of tea you're going to buy?
Yeah I think I'll buy Kona Kiki is cute
Wow, awesome! I wanted to ride Kona too!
I tried it on Socar and it seemed okay.
Little Mom, what were you doing yesterday?
I was taking a yoga class yesterday ㅜㅜ
I was talking to Kiki's eldest daughter and her little mother's voice was really loud.
that's right
So I think my throat is about to get sore~
Oh my gosh ㅜㅜ How many hours does it take?
Work 3 hours a day for 50 minutes each
Oh my! You started working at 9 yesterday!
Do you do this three times a day?
Divide it into morning, afternoon, and evening~ Kiki
Freela, you have to work hard
I see
What time is it?
9 o'clock 3 o'clock 8 o'clock Kiki divided
I see
Do you only do this on weekdays?
Yeah, I need to rest this weekend too.
Yeah, Kiki, you're lucky there's a job like that in Kosicoku!
I can't make as much money as I used to.
I guess so,
But how are the classes conducted?
I'm having a video class via Zoom Kiki
Did you cry when your second son went to the military?
No, but doesn't that make you feel better?
Kiki Whew Kiki Usually all mothers cry
I wish I could go home quickly since I'm so busy.
Kiki: So where are you now?
It's in Paju and will be out soon
Oh my, what is this? Going out, staying out overnight? Vacation?
It's a total disaster
Time is already
Wow Kiki, did he go in last year?
Yeah, it was August last year, but I didn't go on vacation.
Kiki, did you lose all your vacations because of Corona?
Yeah, so I got discharged early.
Wow Kiki, she must be really excited right now.
Oh, I like your voice every time you call me
Kiki, your voice is full of anticipation, second son~
I know.
What are you going to do when you come out?
Where did you learn little mom yoga?
I first learned it in the local office program.
How many years have you been going there to study?
Maybe after sending my daughter to elementary school?
Wow, it's really been that long?!?
Well~ It's been a long time since we started
I ended up becoming a lecturer
Who recommended you to become instructor Kiki?
Little Mom Teacher~
Kiki was the instructor at the local office.
Oh really?
Are you still working together?
He also teaches through video conferences these days.
Oh really?
Does he also teach via Zoom?
Yeah, that's right
I can't go to class these days because of Corona.
Oh my gosh ㅜㅜ When will I be able to have face-to-face classes!?
I'll probably go next year when we have Corona
So, I'll be meeting the members soon!?
yes
I want to go out and work soon~
Little Mom, Little Dad, what are you doing now?
Kiki in the middle of packing little daddy three
It's always the same
Kiki Sam packaging?
What do you do after work?
Yeah Kiki
I'm so busy these days that I don't have time to rest.
Do you still go to the mountains on weekends these days?
Ah, if you ask where it is, most likely it's a mountain.
Kiki, where did you go this time?
On the way to Gangwon-do, there is a mountain whose name I don't know. Kiki
Kiki, did you dig up a lot of seaweed this time when you went there?
I came here empty-handed and I'm going crazy again this weekend
Oh my gosh ㅜㅜ If I go again, I wonder if I'll be able to see Sam!
I'm so tired, so tired~
I wish I could stop going to the mountains
Kiki, it's been decades now, but will you really not go?
So I told him to go live in the mountains.
Kiki, I want to become a natural person like my dad~
My dad said he'd like to go. I don't think he'll go~
How did Little Mom meet Little Dad?
We met in the mountains
Company hiking club Kiki
Wow, little dad was climbing the mountain back then too?
That's right, that was a bad meeting~
Kiki, why is this meeting wrong~
It was a good meeting~
Well, Kiki, I'm not sure because I'm older ^^
Kiki, I see ㅜㅜ
But you gave birth to two babies who are like rice cakes~
Ahhh~ What good is it when people don't even listen to what you say~
Kiki, why are you always doing well outside?
No, these days they are carnivores Kiki
I have to tell them to get out quickly
Kiki, it looks like you're thinking of going out?
He looks like he's going to leave soon and the second one is the problem
Kiki But the second one is also a free spirit, so I think she'll leave soon!
Second, I like being at home.
Kiki, really?
Don't you like playing with friends?
I like it, but when I get home, I always sleep.
Doesn't little mom like furry animals?
that's right
I have enough black-haired beasts at home...
Kiki's house has three black-haired beasts?
Yeah, that's right
Their fur can't be ignored either
Kiki, what should I do? ㅜㅜ
But what about those kids in the bathroom?
They are frogs that little dad caught
I was sleeping at home when I heard crying from somewhere at night.
Yeah, the ones that escaped were all dead in the morning.
Oh my gosh ㅜㅜ Then what do they do?
They say they eat it fried or use it as medicine.
Wow, where are the frogs good for?
Good for your knees
I guess it's useful for giving me medicine.
Oh really?
Is it because they jump around so well?
Well, isn't Kiki's voice too loud?
Oh right
I used to sleep with that as a lullaby at night!
My daughter's friend also went to the bathroom and was shocked.
So, little mom, do you do yoga every day?
Yeah, I'm practicing Ashtanga in the morning.
What is Ashtang?
Is that a type of yoga too?
Ashtanga! The most difficult of all yoga
Wow, wow, there's a type of yoga like that?
Yeah, you have to do it every morning for an hour.
Really? Is that what you call training?
Yeah, right, it's to Indian music.
I see, so you do it for an hour a day?
Yeah, I do that and go hiking too
Wow, so that's the secret to Mom's little body.
no
My stomach is sticking out these days because I'm getting older lol
Hey, what kind of life is that? It's a baby's life.
I'm over 50kg now ㅜㅜ
I need to go on a diet
Are you over 50 now?
My mom was over 60 degrees ㅜ
Aha, let's exercise together!
What games did you play when you were little, Mom?
My little mother liked playing baduk.
Oh my, baduk?
I've seen Ghost Baduk King a lot!
Oh Kiki, I just did it with the neighborhood elders
Oh really
Are you saying that you and your little mother also joined in on the fun in that house?
Well~ I was a baduk prodigy back then Kiki
Oh really?
Even though I know how to play baduk, I can't play it!
Once you understand the rules, you'll be able to do it in no time.
Kiki, no, I know what that is, but when I do it, I don't know what I put down.
Yes, you have to concentrate well, Kiki, it's a battle of wits
Kiki, the only game I can play is the game of the kernel,
Do you know how to play Omok?
of course
Who can't play Omok~
Kiki, do you want to play Omok on the next New Year's Day?
Oh good
Should we have a family team battle like last time?
of course
I'll eat with my daughter and team
Little Mom, aren't you going on a trip with Little Dad?
Travel well...
I went camping last year
Camping? Do you have camping gear at home?
no
Kiki, a place like a caravan
It's convenient because you lend me everything
Ah, Kiki, you two went alone?
No, my daughter and I went together
I see
Caravan, but isn't it small?
All three of you go in?
There were three of them, but Kiki was small, so
Kiki: Well, it's fortunate that the three of us can sleep together!?
It was bigger than I thought and there was a bathroom, so it was nice.
Oh my gosh Kiki
Where did you go?
There is a place called Seokmodo in Ganghwado, and I think it is okay.
Ganghwado? I've never been there before. Where is it?
It's near Incheon, so if you live in Seoul, go there with your boyfriend.
I guess so
My boyfriend lives in Pyeongtaek, so we should leave from Pyeongtaek together!
Yeah, it's close so it's worth going haha
Little Mom, did you just stay at home today?
No, I went out and came back
I often go to the mountains these days
Really? But wasn't it hotter than you thought today?
that's right
I got to the top and sweat was pouring down my face
Kiki: It's supposed to be cool when you get to the top!
Oh, it was cold yesterday, but it's fine today
Was it cold yesterday?
It's still hot here,
Even though it's in the same metropolitan area, the weather is really different
Yeah, that's right ㅜㅜ
They even said it was 24 degrees today! Highest temperature ever!
That's all I can do, and it's so hot
therefore
Our company still turns on the air conditioner Kiki
Hey next week it's full-on winter
Will that really happen!? Ta-da!
Yeah, they say the lowest price is 2 degrees, but it's winter.
You're saying the lowest price will be 2 degrees next week?
The temperature is expected to drop sharply starting this weekend.
Do you know the volleyball sisters?
Sisters Da-young Lee and Seo-young Lee!?
Yeah, the kids who got released this time?
that's right
Did you hear that they're moving to Greece?
Bad things.
Aren't you running away from the country to abroad?
Well, there is no place in the country where I can play.
Yeah, I can't even show my face
That's right, but I heard that public opinion in Greece has become really bad this time!
The rumor spread all the way there~
No, it was okay when they said they were transferring because of school violence, but this time they say there was chaos in Greece because of some incident!
What is causing this?
Did you know that Da-young Lee got married?
Oh really?
I didn't know that
I got married and got divorced very quickly, and my husband is receiving psychiatric treatment because of Lee Da-young.
Oh, is that why public opinion in Greece has turned bad?
Oh, it's because it was revealed that she was violent towards her husband!
I guess you knew you'd do well even if you went to Greece~
Is there anyone around who has had a little Mom Jansen hit?
There is no Jansen, only those in their 30s are suitable.
that's right
People who got Janssen decided to get a booster shot this time!
Wow~ They say that if you get hit once, everything will be fine, Kiki
Kiki, so
They said that after a few months, the antibody level dropped to 60%.
I heard that Pfizer and Moderna are like that too.
that's right
But I know Moderna is thinking about it now!
Oh. I heard Pfizer is already vaccinating medical personnel.
Yeah Kiki
And Janssen decided to get Moderna as a booster shot!
Is that cross-inoculation possible?
Oh, Janssen said that it is more effective when taken with Moderna!
I see
If you think you'll get sick again, stop getting vaccinated~
Oh, they say that the person who got Jansen's treatment was in pain for a week.
Yeah, that's because the medicine is strong and it hurts for a week.
That's right ㅜㅜ I lost my appetite and lost a lot of weight ㅜㅜ
But then it all came back up and it made my mouth water a lot.
Did your little mom get an eyeliner tattoo?
Yeah, I did it semi-permanently, but it's starting to fade~
Oh really?
When did you do that?
I did it a year ago and it lasted a long time and was good
I see
What color is it?
It's black Kiki
Your eyes look big and it's okay
Kiki is right
The eyes look so dark, it's nice to look at
Yeah, it's okay to go out bare-faced
Kiki, where did you go to do that?
Did you go to the dermatologist?
No, it's just a neighborhood eyelash place~
Oh really?
Doesn't it hurt when you do that?
It hurts, but it just stings a little
I can't do it because I hate being sick~
Yeah, don't do it yet.
The marks left behind aren't pretty
Kiki, I get it. I'll get the tattoo later~
Yeah, you can do it later when you're little mommy~
Little Mom, does anything hurt anywhere?
I'm tired these days because the area under my eyes is twitching
Wow, aren't there any supplements these days?
Magnesium? I heard it's good, so I'm going to try buying some~
that's right
I'm taking magnesium too
The twitching under my eyes is no joke ㅜ
I guess it's because I look at the computer a lot
Yeah ㅜㅜ
My throat hurts so much too
Why your neck?
Are you sick because of the gall bladder?
I think so, it hurts so much ㅜㅜ
Try something like physical therapy
Kiki, didn't you know I went to acupuncture!?
Oh, is that so?
The young one already~
Kiki, I came up to Seoul and it seems like I'm just getting sick ㅜ
That's right, living in Seoul isn't easy~
Yeah ㅜㅜ
It's even sadder because I'm sick in Seoul ㅜ
That's because I'm far away from my family
How does your little mom buy things like clothes?
I often buy yoga clothes~ on the internet
Where can I buy Kiki's yoga clothes?
I often buy and wear Mullaware
Good material
Mulaware? Which celebrity endorses that brand?
Lee Ha-nui is promoting Kiki
Oh really?
I think it's okay, Andar!?
I don't buy it often because it has a lot of fluff
Oh really?
Have you tried wearing that too?
of course
I won't buy it because the material is not good
Then Mullaware is the best
What's the price range?
I got it cheap because I got an instructor discount, so it's not that expensive.
Wow, instructor; is there a discount or something?
Of course Kiki
Get a discount if you register for a sports instructor certification
Wow, this is amazing
How much discount is it?
Give me a 5% discount every time I buy
Does your little mom watch YouTube often?
Of course~
Watch the rebroadcast of Mr. Trot
Kiki, who is your favorite Mr. Trot singer?
I like Im Young-woong the most, he's handsome
My mom likes Kim Ho-joong the most~
Yeah? Kim Ho-joong is famous too~
The hero's neck is also long, lol
Oh right Kiki
And Lim Young-woong also looks gentle~
yes.
Kiki, you look like something moms would like
Kiki is right
Young people are eating chantobegi saronghae~
My daughter likes Youngtak Kiki
I only drink makgeolli with Yeongtak
Kiki Ah Young Tak, is this true?
But this time there was a problem with that makgeolli company, right?
Yeah, I don't know the details, but I heard Youngtak sings well.
Kiki Youngtak sings the song so refreshingly!
Yeah. Kiki, have a drink~ Have a drink~ This song is good.
Let's run until Kiki comes. Is this it?
Yeah you know too Kiki
That song is really famous
Does little mom like watching movies?
I like old movies~
Do you know Tazza?
Oh my gosh, when was Kiki the Ta-cha?
Have you watched all of season 123?
no.
I only saw the original
I feel like I've seen it a few times
Kiki, but 2 and 3 are both secretly fun!
I know 2, but what about 3?
When did the deal come out?
3 is One-Eyed Jack, featuring Lee Kwang-soo!
Hey, but you can't beat the original~
The hand is flying away, Blanche
Kiki, that's true
But because of the original, the 2nd and 3rd seasons are buried Kiki
Of course, there is no comparison
You can't beat Jo Seung-woo
Kiki ah admit kiki
I liked Kim Hye-soo too!
You can shoot!
Yerim, look at that pattern!
Isn't that a long seat?
Kiki, what are you Sakura!?
Is this correct?
I'll just take half of the money~
Kiki ah creepy kiki
So what happened to Jo Seung-woo in the end?
Jo Seung-woo quietly disappeared after releasing Sampalgwangddaeng
Hey, what did you eat for dinner?
I'm going on a diet now.
Eat eggs
Wow, you only ate one egg for dinner?
No, you ate three eggs, Kiki?
Kiki I ate a sandwich!
Wow, that fills your stomach?
What, you ate three too!
I'm trying to lose belly fat now ㅠㅠ
Kiki, that's right, oppa, you need to lose some belly fat!
Yeah, I'm going to try a detox diet! ㅜㅜ
What kind of detox diet are you going to do?
I'm going to drink parsley lemon detox juice
Oh, that's the famous detox juice!
You said it doesn't taste good?
But I heard it was good because the toxins were removed and I left a review.
Kiki Oh, good, good. How long do you plan on doing this?
Kiki while your pants are getting the right size
When are you going to see your brother's house?
I'm going this weekend. Do you want to go together?
Kiki Oh great, I wanted to see the house too!
It's a newly built officetel. Do you want to go take a look?
Oh really? There was a place like that in Pyeongtaek?
They are building a lot in Pyeongtaek these days.
Oh, I see. But are you thinking of living alone?
Yeah, I'm still living alone and will be moving to a two-room apartment with my girlfriend later.
Kiki Oh, did you discuss this with your girlfriend?
No, it's my opinion Kiki
I'll ask later
Kiki, how much money are you thinking about?
I'm currently looking at about 8000 with a mortgage loan.
Oh, I see. You already received a small business loan, oppa?
Yeah, I guess I'll just pay the loan interest and then I'll have to come out ^^
Phew, that's right. How much is the loan interest?
Kiki and I make about 120,000 won a month
It seems cheaper than monthly rent!
Bro, who did you go to work at night with?
I went with the shooter Kiki
Kiki shooter? Are you talking about that team leader?
Yeah, that's right, Kiki was suddenly called out at night.
Oh, oppa, what time did you finish yesterday?
It finished past 12 o'clock yesterday ㅠㅠ
Then isn't it time for the last train to leave?
Yeah, so I took a taxi and got transportation support.
Oh, I see. Where was Kiki's night shift location?
It was close to my house because it was on the outskirts of Pyeongtaek.
I see, but I guess it would be more expensive at night because there's a surcharge?
Yeah, but I just rode it because they supported the transportation fee ㅜㅜ It was too hard
Oh my gosh ㅜㅜ That's right, no, they're making me work at night in these times!
What I'm saying is that it's comfortable and nice to take a taxi.
Kiki, thank goodness you caught a taxi right away?
No, I waited for over 10 minutes on the taxi.
Honey, where did you eat dinner last night?
I ate at the cafeteria because I was working ㅜ
I see. Is there a restaurant in the company?
Yeah that's right Kiki our company restaurant is so delicious
Oh really? The restaurant is free to use?
No, I think it's okay to pay about 3,000 won Kiki
Kiki, wow, it's 3 thousand won?
What's on today?
Today's black pork duruchigi kiki
I like my aunts' cooking
Kiki, if you get a duruchi for 3,000 won, it's a total bargain!
Yeah, that's our company's welfare.
That's really good, we have to buy it ㅜ
Oh, that's too bad. What about the food expenses?
Well, 100,000 won, haha
Oh but where does it come from!
Hahaha, is that so? I don't know,
But I heard there are still many places that don't give it to you.
Did your brother buy you cosmetics at PX?
Yeah, of course gold cream was trendy.
Kiki Oh, you mean there was gold cream back in your day too?
That's a classic.
Better than snails
Kiki: Really? That's so expensive!
About 20 thousand won?
Kiki, not that expensive
But I heard that costs several hundred thousand won on the market?
That's the market and Kiki's Army is duty free so cool~
Kiki, how many of those did you buy, oppa?
I bought 10 of them and gave them to my aunts.
Wow Kiki, that's right. Oppa, you have a lot of aunts, right?
Yes, I gave it to 7 people and the rest are being used at home.
Wow, you're still using that!?
There are a lot of them and the expiration date is long, but I think they're all used up
Kiki: That's right, you have to apply it generously!
So my face is always oily
Did you study well in high school, oppa?
No, I'm totally last Kiki
Kiki, why did you go to the unemployed field?
Yeah, that's right, but I was the worst at Korean, English, and Math Kiki
It's okay. In the vocational world, practical training is more important than Korean, English, and math.
Yeah, I also liked the internship the best!
Oppa, you were a baker, right?
What did you do during baking time?
I made bread and baked cookies and stuff.
Kiki oppa, you made really good bread last time!?
What I do best is making night bread Kiki
Kiki Oh my gosh, we have a chestnut tree at home!
That night I can't use it, I have to make it into a can of chestnut stew!
Oh my, Kiki, but the canned chestnuts are much sweeter and tastier!
Yeah, I eat a lot of canned food at school Kiki
Kiki, really? I steal so many chocolate chips!
Yes, especially the chocolate chunks are delicious
Brother, how is your mother feeling?
You've gotten a lot better lately, Kiki
Walk well and get around
Thank goodness ㅜㅜ I was worried because you had trouble moving last time!
Yeah, I slipped.
I changed all the bathroom tiles ㅜ
Oh my gosh ㅜㅜ Seriously, all the elderly need to be careful in the bathroom!
Yeah, I think the tiles are old and worn out.
You really have to be careful with that!
Start construction!
Yeah and I'm going to put the rubber mat on the babies.
Oh, good. So the fractured leg has healed well?
He still needs more rehabilitation!
Yeah ㅜㅜ It's a fracture ㅜㅜ
When did you get hurt?
Before Chuseok, so I just lay around this Chuseok
Oh my gosh ㅜㅜ So that's why you said you couldn't go to your grandmother's house!
Yeah, it was really bad back then so I just lay down.
Ha, what are you doing on a holiday?
That's right, I skipped Kiki's sacrifice and rested too.
When do you plan on getting married, oppa?
Marriage happens when your girlfriend asks you to!
Doesn't your girlfriend look so young now?
Yeah, we're 5 years apart ㅠㅠ
Hey, oppa, aren't you going to have a plate of eggs right now?
Yeah, so it's unknown when I'll get married.
Kiki, but you never know what's going on with people!
Why don't you know? I'm going to marry my girlfriend!
Kiki No, you might even get married sooner~
Well, my girlfriend said she wants to do it when she's over 30.
Then, oppa, you must be at least 36 years old?
What I'm saying is... what if I get dumped like that?
Kiki, no, Oppa, you don't have to worry about tea~
Is that so? I wonder if I'll be abusive to other people ㅜㅜ
Kiki, you can't trust your girlfriend like that!?
But still, a good person can appear
Oppa, Merong said you got scaling done this time!?
Yeah, that's right, I did it because it was so dirty~
Kiki Ha, Merong must have been anesthetized then?
Yeah, that's right, I can't help it because I'm going crazy like that ㅠㅠ
Oh no ㅜㅜ I have to go play at Merong Delku again!
Yeah, I was thinking about going to a dog cafe anyway!
Oh, I like dog cafes
In which area did they build a huge dog cafe!?
It's near Pyeongtaek, and there's a dog park on the rooftop!
Oh right, have you been there?
I saw it on Instagram, but Merong is taking it
Kiki, oh my gosh, let's go together! ;
Okay, do you have time this weekend?
This weekend, let's go look at houses!
I'm not looking at the house all day, I'm just signing the contract and coming!
Kiki: Then let's take Merongi too!
I need to show Merongi how to adapt to the new house he's moving into.
Don't you go to a sports club or something?
I joined the table tennis club!
Oh, table tennis? I'm a total prodigy~
Oh really? I've never seen it hit.
Kiki, I also got an A in practical skills when I was in high school!
Oh, you had your performance evaluated through table tennis?
Oh yeah, our team was the only one that got this right!
Oh wow, you must have had a great rally, Kiki
Kiki, you have to go back and forth more than 20 times to get this!
I also want to learn properly this time
Kiki Oh, that's a good idea!
Come join me later!
Okay, I have to teach you more haha
Kiki Then then~ Steps are important in table tennis!
Oh, I'm going to mess up my body step Kiki
Kiki Ou, table tennis shouldn't be like that!
Then what should I do?
What is your favorite game, oppa?
I'm playing Tales Runner again these days Kiki
Wow, Kiki oppa knows about Tales Runner?
Of course Kiki, I even grew blue boots
Kiki Blue Boots! Who did Kiki do it with!
I used to play games with my friends a lot back then
Kiki, did you fully equip your pension?
Ah, the armor made me sick
Kiki O Armor Kiki Latte said that the bee was the strongest alchemist~
No, the crayfish armor was really good Kiki
No, that was the 3rd one and the 4th one was a bee~
Oh, that's a different order
Kiki is right! Or maybe the crayfish had speed 1 and strength 3 and the bee had 4!
Oh, then I guess I didn't do it until I got the crayfish ㅜ
Kiki and the jackpot even made a mountain goat and stopped
You're a real gamer, Kiki. I caught you.
Oppa, so you're saying you're going to Jeju Island in the end?
Oh no, I'm just going to save up that money and go abroad!
But you can't travel now, right?
No, you can go to Saipan and Guam with the travel bubble!
Oh, aren't Saipan and Guam really far away?
Yeah, but it's a vacation spot so I think my girlfriend will like it
Did you talk to your girlfriend and decide to go together?
I haven't said anything yet, but I'll take Kiki as a surprise
Oh, wow, you're going to give us the Bangki tickets and tell us where to go?
Yeah, let's get vaccinated together before that!
But didn't you say you were getting a girlfriend next year?
Well, I'll try to convince you soon after I get hit Kiki
Kiki: So when are you planning to go on a trip?
Well, my girlfriend's birthday is in January next year, so then or in February
Wow, you definitely have to go in January, it's the coldest month!
Yeah, that's good because you can heal in a warm place.
Where were you working today, brother?
Kiki working near the sea today
If it's the sea, is it the West Sea or the East Sea? Where?
It's the West Sea, but the sea breeze is no joke
It must have been a bit chilly there!?
Yeah I worked wearing a hoodie
Wow ㅜㅜ It was hot in Seoul. I sweated so much ㅜ
Oh really? What was the temperature there today?
They said the temperature was 21 degrees, but I was sweating so much!
Really? The UV rays are really strong, Kiki
No, I think it's because they don't turn on the air conditioning in the subway!
Aha, what did you wear today?
I just wear a regular sweatshirt to work!
It's hot when you wear man to man during the day. Kiki
But I didn't have any hair at all ㅜㅜ
I like to wear short sleeves and a cardigan during the day.
Honey, did you say you got Pfizer this time?
Yeah no I'm Moderna!
Oh, I see. This time, a person in their 20s died after getting Pfizer again.
Wow, Pfizer is really scary
That's right. This guy was fine after getting hit, but then suddenly collapsed.
A deal like that that happened just a few days after we met?
Well, they said it would happen in 5 days!
Oh my, it's scary...
I have a reservation for the Moderna vaccine.
Oh, I don't know,
Anyway, this guy went out to exercise after 5 days and got sick.
Still, you need to monitor your condition for up to a week and get plenty of rest.
So ㅜㅜ he said that his heart started pounding a little after he got hit the second time
I guess young people have a lot of side effects.
Yeah, but I think it's really random for young people or old people.
Honestly, if you're unlucky, you'll probably get side effects
Yes, I am or I am not, that is the question!
Think about it a lot, I still think it should be right Kiki
Did you know that our country, the US, and North Korea are having a meeting in Washington right now?
Why is our country and North Korea? Kiki is scary
They are discussing whether denuclearization comes first or whether the declaration of the end of the war comes first.
Ah... why are you guys discussing that?
Kiki, no, this is something that our country, North Korea, and the United States should do together.
What I'm saying is, why are they making a fuss without us knowing?
Kiki, no, it's not like we're secretly going in, our country is also in it,
A deal where three people talk in Washington?
Oh right, but I can't come to a conclusion.
Well, it's not an issue that can be decided easily.
Kiki is right ㅜㅜ All that needs to be done is for North Korea to do well!
You need to be a little more cooperative
Kiki suddenly creates nuclear weapons and blows up telephone lines,
Yeah. I really get scared when I'm in the military.
Kiki Oh, I see. Nothing much happened during Kiki's time, right?
The moment the missile is launched, wait~ wait~
Honey, how much did your braces cost you just now?
I just got 500 Kiki management fee
Wow, oppa, you said you were going to do it in Seoul, so you did it in Seoul.
I went to a famous dental clinic in Seoul after hearing about it.
I see. When you see it, do you think it would be okay for you to do it too?
I think it would be okay for you to do it too, but aren't your front teeth protruding?
Yeah, but if you do a nose job, it'll go in.
Are you sure you got a nose job?
Well, I was thinking about it and now I'm going to do it.
Wow, my girlfriend was going crazy about getting her nose done. How much is the estimate?
Kiki, I got over 3 million won.
You really eat a lot. Where do you do it?
I do it in Gangnam~
I'm going to be a Gangnam beauty~
I'm going to be one of those plastic surgeons walking around Gangnam.
Don't you recognize me, oppa? Kiki
Okay... I'll call you Fake Nose from now on.
I think my brother has really bad stomach
Yeah I think I take a shit once a week
Every time you come to my house, you go straight to the bathroom.
I'm trying to force it, but it doesn't come out
Kiki, you know what?
I can hear my brother farting outside,
Yeah, I just fart and can't poop ㅜ
Kiki ha, you'd better take a shit, the fart sound is no joke!
Sorry... Then buy me some probiotics ㅜ
Kiki, there's that probiotic I bought you at Olyoung!
That didn't have any effect at all ㅜㅜ
No, no. Then should I eat something stronger?
Yeah, I heard that Purun is really straight!
Oh right, have you ever tried that, bro?
No, I was scared so I couldn't eat it
Kiki, but if you eat that, a disaster could happen!
Oh really? Is it true that the sky is singing?
Oppa, the stock market is booming right now
Yeah that's right my Samsung Galaxy is gone
Kiki: So, should I go in this time?
It's 60,000 won, so I think I can go in now Kiki
Kiki, do you think it won't fall to 50,000?
If it goes that far, Samsung will be ruined...
Kiki Really? Then it should be in the early 60,000 won range!
I think it's probably 68,900 won now
Okay, then should I try to hold on to 63,000 won?
Kakao is also falling a lot, so go there too
Wow, I think I said that Kakao went up a lot last time!?
It's 120,000 won now...
It fell by 20-30 thousand won
Oh my gosh ㅜㅜ But since when has Kakao been a 100,000 won stock!
I'm not sure about that either
I only saw it when I was going up ㅜㅜ
Kiki I should have bought it when KakaoTalk became popular!
That's why we need to take a closer look at Kiki Startup companies.
Oppa, do you know the program Delicious Guys?
Yeah, I know, but I don't really look at it!
Oh really? Then do you know who appears in it?
*** I don't remember anything else, who is it?
They say *** and *** and *** also appear there~
Ahhhhhh I remember Kiki
Eat well and be cute
Yeah Kiki but this time *** came out ㅜ
Oh really? What did you do when you came out?
No, I was saying that he left the program!
Oh, why did you get off?
Oh, there was no special reason, he just left for his own development!
Aha... It's a shame, but the 4-person combination is still good.
That's right ㅜㅜ I guess they aren't going to recruit new people yet!
I think it would be too empty to have a three-person system like that
Right ㅜㅜ Who will be the one to go in?
Well, I don't think there's a replacement ㅜㅜ
Honey, the movie 'The Sword of Demons' is coming out this month. Do you want to watch it together?
Yeah... I still don't understand the content, sob sob
Wow! I told you to look!
Sorry... I honestly can't understand what it says even if I look at it ㅜㅜ
Kiki Oh no! I'll have to force myself to watch it later!
It took a long time to get me into anime...
Kiki Ha, oh my, I need someone to watch it with!
You can watch it with your sister!
That's right, I initiated you too, sister!
My sister's boyfriend is also a huge fan of the ear knife!
Oh really? I heard a lot of people cried when they saw that.
Oh, I cried too
But do you know how old the author who created this is?
Really?... Just amazing
How old was this made?
I'm a 31 year old woman, do you know how much I earn from this?
Oh... You're so young. How much did you earn?
310 billion, does that really sound like a billion? That's amazing.
Wow, this is amazing. I can already live off of this for three generations.
Is lunch available at your company?
Our company is on-site, so we just have to buy it.
Why do I have to buy it myself when I'm not there?
Don't they serve food there? Quit.
Kiki dirt I'm so sad,
Today at the convenience store,
But these days, convenience store lunch boxes are really good.
Oh, but have you ever tried a convenience store lunch box?
I've tried it. I eat it often.
But isn't it a bit salty?
Hey, the scene is so salty that I'm sweating
Kiki Okay~ I don't sweat so that's why I'm swollen!
A friend of mine doesn't eat with me because he doesn't like spicy food.
Kiki, isn't your brother eating really salty foods?
Kiki's field people all eat salty Kiki
The salt is gone and needs to be recharged
Wow, I'm so touched. I'll buy you some sea salt later!
That's why you sent me salt last time, Kiki.
Oppa, do you live alone now?
Yeah, I've been living alone for 5 years now.
Can I go play at your house tomorrow?
Can you come to Daejeon?
Kiki, it's possible to go all the way to Daejeon~
If you fall, your nose will touch it~
Kiki then come play
Come and clean up.
Kiki, clean up? If I clean, you'll buy me food?
No, each person should eat that too. Just like we each eat Kiki
Oh no, Kiki, you're so ridiculous
If you clean it, don't you have to buy it for me by default?
Hey, what's so hard about that tiny studio apartment?
Come and clean my room
Kiki, do you still have your TV?
These days it's full option
Are you from the Stone Age?
Kiki I don't have any, why? Is there a problem?
Huh? Huh?; What does that mean Kiki sumimasen...
Kiki, what are the options for washing machine, microwave, refrigerator, etc.?
Nowadays, we watch TV on our phones instead of TV ^^
How is your company doing, brother?
I commute by car Kiki
Oh, oppa, is that the same car you were driving back then?
Yeah right that big shit colored car Kiki
Kiki, what are you doing Kiki?
When are you going to change it?
Hey, I still like this
The only thing that's not great is the color. It's better than Kiki.
Kiki Are you sure? But who drives a shit-colored car these days? Kiki
Do you have a lot of money?
Are you going to buy me a new car? Kiki
Kiki: So, you'll be my knight for the rest of my life?
I'm so busy trying to make a living that I'm dying. Don't say things like that.
Kiki, I don't have any money, so why are you asking me to buy a car?
Kiki, these things that don't exist are having a conversation like this Kiki
Kiki: Then what kind of car do you want to buy, oppa?
I don't expect much, just an Audi or something?
Then brother, Audi is too expensive and there is Damas!
Wasn't that your dream car?
Kiki, it's yours
Oppa, what do you mainly do on site?
I manage people's safety and do design work.
Oh, then oppa, a safety helmet is required?
Of course, if an accident happens, it can be a big problem, so people have to be careful.
Oppa, have you ever had a major incident while you were on set?
There isn't one yet, but it shouldn't be there ㅠㅠ
Oh ㅜㅜ That's right. An old man I know is hospitalized with a back injury!
Wow, but where is something like that? ㅠㅠ
That's okay
Right ㅜㅜ Then how many hours will you be at the site?
I go out at dawn and come back in the evening ㅠㅠ
There is no time to rest
Oh my gosh ㅜㅜ Is this true? How long do I have to work like that?
Since this is my job, I'm going to earn a lot of money and rest.
Kiki: I see. It's cold in the winter, so work hard until then!
If you do that, you'll really get frostbite in the winter Kiki
Kiki, where did you say you were working now?
Kiki, I'm currently working in Daejeon
Oppa, how is your reserve force training going now?
The reserves are just honey
Just go and play~
But are there cases where the reserve forces stay for 1 night and 2 days?
Yeah, of course there are cases like that.
Kiki, it's a little different every time
My boyfriend is out all night because of his military service, so I don't have to be suspicious, right?
Oh, you don't have to do it
But just in case ^^ Break up
Kiki, the story of breaking up is true?
Isn't that too much?
I'm lonely without you, I wish we could all just break up~
Kiki it's okay oppa
I like it alone ^^
Yeah, that's definitely the case for those who have it! But not me ^^
Kiki, then get a LAN girlfriend or something.
My pride still won't allow me to do that!
Kiki, you're still young~
Just date~
But I got old because I worked so much
Your face looks like you're in your 40s
Okay, Kiki, then you should meet a 40-year-old woman~
Do you really want to die Kiki?
I'm so angry~
Oppa, what did you study to get into that company?
Ah, I joined my uncle's company and learned more than I studied. Kiki
Wow, it's a parachute. Is it a corruption?
Kiki, it's not a big company to the point where you can talk about corruption.
How many employees are there in total?
There are 5 employees and they use a lot of daily labor.
Then, oppa, what is your position at that company?
I was a manager, but what I'm doing is an intern Kiki
Kiki, it's a real parachute~
Is this the police station?
No, this is a fire station~
Ah, Kkabi~ Then is there anything you want to study, oppa?
Yeah, just dig a well here Kiki
Oh, do you think this company has a vision?
For now, I'm going to work hard like a pie person and rest.
Kiki Pie Tribe? What is that?
First time hearing this!
Ah, it's not the pie tribe, it's the fire tribe, Kiki
Didn't your brother say he had a younger brother?
Who did you say was there then?
Little brother? Who are you confusing me with now?
I have a sister Kiki
I know so many older brothers, it's confusing~
You guys, cut it off
My memory is not that good, Kiki
Kiki, that's right ㅜㅜ There are so many that my memories are all mixed up ㅜ
Kiki, my sister got married this time.
Oh, right! Did you do it in Nonsan or Daejeon?
My sister met a person from Seoul and got married in Seoul. Kiki
I see. When did you get married? May?
Sister, you said you were going to get married in May, and you did in May, Kiki
Wow Kiki, but this time, didn't the government impose a lot of sanctions because of the coronavirus?
That's right, so I just invited only the people close to me and sent them a small message Kiki
Oh my gosh ㅜㅜ The wedding really needs to be grand!
Okay, as long as the two of you are happy, what's the big deal?
Kiki, your family is very wealthy, both financially and emotionally.
My house is ruined...
So I just let go of my mind... Kiki
Oppa, is there a woman you want to marry right now?
There is no woman to marry, and no woman to date.
Oh, no, should I say that the ideal type of woman is the one I want to marry?
I think it would be nice if Kiki could just be someone who can wear skirts now
Kiki: So you like transgender people too?
Ah, that's because my mind is still closed, Kiki
Kiki, why are transgenders so pretty these days?
Oh but if you're taller than me it's a bit weird~
Kiki oppa is 168cm
what do you think about it?
Hmm... still no -_-
You hate it so much?
Kiki Oki I understand~
Then I'll go wearing a skirt~
You can't
I have so many older brothers that my memory isn't that good Kiki
Kiki, that's right. I'm going to say this and then forget again~?
How many people are you so obsessed with, you bad girl?
I don't even remember~
Have you fallen for my charm?
Wow, you should always wear a life jacket, Kiki.
My brother, there's something like a dog house at your house!?
A puppy? I'm thinking of bringing a cat to my house right now.
Oh really? Where did you get the cat?
My friend gave me a cat for my birthday.
Wow! How can a cat be so cute!?
Oh, but I can tell when I see a dog, but I can't tell when I see a cat, Kiki
Hmm, what does it look like?
I'm a cat butler!
I'll send you a picture, would you like to take a look?
Oh, okay~ If I pretend, it'll pretend!
I sent you a picture Kiki
Have you checked?
Hey, isn't that an American Shorthair?
So cute!
Really? I think this is a stray cat.
Kiki, no, if you're a stray cat, you look like you've been living in the wild!
Yeah, it was cute
Cats need to be touched from the time they are babies to follow people. Kiki
Kiki, I admit it, Kiki, but why is our Ohbok so upset?
So you got teased by a schnauzer before, Kiki, surprise Kiki
How do you build up your stamina when you work in the field?
Just working builds stamina, so what else is there to do?
Kiki, right? Oppa, you carry heavy things too!?
I do help out sometimes, but Kiki, if you have to finish early!
Kiki, what are you doing carrying that heavy cement?
No, that's not it. It's iron and all. Kiki
But isn't it the same thing, being heavy?
Yeah, it's super hot in the summer~
Wow, wow, aren't you going to get burned?
Kiki, you weren't burned because you were wearing gloves.
When working on site, it seems like safety really comes first.
That's why I always buy good safety shoes Kiki
Oh really? Oppa, where do you buy your safety shoes from?
I always shop for safety shoes at K2 company Kiki
Yeah, the safety shoes there are really good~
It's definitely different from the cheap ones, Kiki
What games do you play at home, oppa?
I play Go-Stop and Hwa-tu with the old men.
Kiki, are you betting your money on this?
No, these days we meet through mobile phones, but since we work with adults, Kiki
Oh, is that something you do with a new suit?
No I'm doing new Kiki
Kiki, that one was really hit hard!
That's right, the sound is so crisp that it feels like it's really hitting you
Kiki, are you a master now?
The old men are much more skilled than me Kiki
Kiki, aren't those uncles there doing something crazy?
I think there are people who do that often Kiki
But you can win a lot if you practice hard!
No, if you lose money, just grow a tree.
Oh, that old red cherry tree? Kiki
Yeah, if you water it, it grows well, Kiki
Honey, where have you been recently?
I tried it once this time, Kiki
Solo travel? Have you ever traveled alone, oppa?
Kiki, I didn't have time to travel with my friends so I just went on a trip alone.
Wow, you can travel alone without any friends?
Then, since everyone is busy, it's hard to find time, and it's better to do it alone?
Oh right ㅜㅜ Where did you go, oppa?
I went paragliding in Damyang Kiki
Wow, that's something that can only be done when the weather is nice!
The weather right now seems really good for riding Kiki
Kiki, that's right. I wanted to ride it too, but wasn't it scary?
It was fine except when it first started running, Kiki
Kiki, really? The old man behind you is riding too, right?
Yeah, without him I would never be able to ride Kiki
Hurry up ㅜㅜ But isn't the experience fee expensive!?
Oh, if you film that, it would cost about 100,000 won, Kiki
Why is the weather like this this week?
Kiki It was cold, then hot, then rainy, so I'm taking a break this time~
Oh really? Does the site close when it rains?
Yeah, that's why we always check the weather Kiki
But what if it rains when I go to work?
Then I have to go back home, Kiki.
Wow, this is so heartbreaking
But what if it stops?
At first, when it rains, Kiki doesn't go to work at all.
Oh, I was shaking today,
So, I usually check the weather before I go to bed.
No, it's definitely raining and the temperature is the same as yesterday, right?
But if there is no sun, the temperature naturally drops.
Oh right, it was sunny yesterday and cloudy today ㅜ
Then it started to rain heavily. I have a lot of work to do.
Kiki, right? Kiki, it shouldn't rain, right?
But even if it rains, I have to work in the office, Kiki
Oppa, did you see that Jo Jae-beom got sentenced to 5 years this time?
Jo Jae-beom? I think I've heard of him somewhere, but who was he?
He was Shim Seok-hee's coach!
Oh right, that was a huge issue, but wasn't it too little?
Oh, but this also increased the sentence, Kiki
Wow, it was originally less?
This country is really rotten
Oh, it was 3 years, but it increased to 5 years!
I'm so pissed off, I wish you wouldn't have embarrassed your fellow man like that.
Kiki ha, but Shim Seok-hee is also controversial right now!
Why was he so controversial?
Dispatch published an article about Choi Min-jeong's backstory!
Wow, but Choi Min-jeong did really well, Kiki
Oh, but do you remember that match where the two of you fell?
Huh, wasn't that during the men's game?
No, the two of them fell over!
Oh really? I'll look for the article and see Kiki.
Oppa~ Let's go on a trip to Singapore~
Are you flirting with this guy right now~ Kiki
Of course~ Oppa said he rests in the winter~
Oh my, how much are you going to eat this time, Kiki?
Kiki, when did I say I ate your spine again?
Hey, I would have bought a house with the money I spent hanging out with you, Kiki.
Kiki, honestly, did I play alone!?
Are you charging me for talking to you right now? Kiki
Kiki No~ Then I'll pay for the flight to Singapore. You pay for the rest.
Wow, this time you're coming out with a conscience, Kiki
Kiki, yeah, the Singapore travel package is out!
Take a look at that
Oh, then the plane ticket will be expensive because there are so many people. Kiki, nice.
Kiki, is that so?
Then, will you pay for the plane ticket?
Then you'll have to pay for the rest, bang bang bang!
Hey! Oppa, is the guest house okay?!
Hey, seriously, you should take me to that pool hotel Kiki
Honey, is the place where you got athlete's foot last time okay?
Athlete's foot? Athlete's foot? Are you kidding me right now? Kiki
No~ Oppa, you suffered a lot because you got athlete's foot!
Oh, that really annoyed me because I had to apply medicine every day Kiki
Kiki Oppa, I was surprised to see that your big toe turned yellow. Kiki
Why are you interested in my feet? It's annoying Kiki
Kiki, should I buy you some toe socks?
No, don't do that
If your pride won't allow it
Kiki Oppa, then you have to wear sandals even in winter!
It needs to be ventilated!
I wear safety shoes a lot, so that's impossible Kiki
Kiki, now I know why you get athlete's foot!
Yeah I know that too but you have to make money Kiki
ㅜㅜ My heart hurts so much
Are there any well-ventilated safety shoes?
Then I think the safety will be greatly reduced Kiki
Hmm, how about you try developing it?
If anyone could develop that, Kiki already did it.
Honey, are there any nutritional supplements you're taking these days?
I skip meals a lot and take iron supplements.
Ah, skipping rice can cause anemia, so it's essential ㅜㅜ
I'm hungry so I'll eat lunch and some snacks.
But when I get home I just sleep Kiki
Can't you just grab something to eat on the go?
But it's a bit... dangerous to eat while driving Kiki
These days, bamboo shoots come in packs. Squeeze them all out and eat them!
I heard that porridge comes in packs these days?
Oh! Come out and squeeze out something that looks like pumpkin porridge or baby food!
Wow, the world has really become a better place these days, Kiki
Kiki, that one only costs two thousand won!
Is that a lot? Or is it just the right amount?
Oh, I tried it once and it was okay?
Are you guaranteeing that it tastes good?
*** Oh, it was so sweet and delicious! Kangchu!
Okay then I'm going shopping now Kiki
Oppa, what I said is sold at Coupang for one-plus-one!
Are you saying that you're doing 1+1 like you said?
Oh! Then each one only costs a thousand won!
Wow, but it seems really good to eat in the morning Kiki
Oh, that's right, just squeeze it all out and throw it in the trash can!
But the quantity is so small, shouldn't I eat 10 of them?
No, one is fine for me, but then you eat two!
Is that just for grabbing a quick meal in the morning?
Oh, that's right! There is something different from pumpkin porridge!
Ah, I like vegetable porridge, abalone porridge, and things like that. Kiki
Oh,? I haven't seen anything like that yet,?
Kimchi octopus porridge Isn't this out yet? Kiki
Wouldn't that cause the octopus to get caught in the tube?
No, just make the entrance a little bigger Kiki
Haha, really? Then, Kiki, why don't you make a suggestion to that company?
Okay, I'll suggest it and make it come out, Kiki
Who was your favorite girl group?
I used to like Girl's Day, Kiki and Sojin
Right Kiki, what is he doing now?
I don't know right now Kiki
Kiki, you're still pretty
Kiki: But Sojin really does look young!
Kiki, you're the oldest there, but you don't get pushed around
That's right, you said you were in your 30s when you were active!
Even if they're with other young idol groups, they're the prettiest
That's right, Kiki Sojin's long hair was the truth!
No, Kiki, you have a pretty little wave
Ah Kiki, and your hair color is a bit red!
No, the brown color is prettier, Kiki
No, the red series really suits you!
Is this what you mean by male and female eyes? Kiki
Kiki, oppa, be honest
Is Yui chubby?
Yui used to be chubby, but she doesn't seem to be like that these days Kiki
Oppa, are you too busy to watch a movie?
No, I'm just lying at home watching Netflix
I heard there's a movie coming out this time featuring Marilyn Monroe!
Then what should I do?
I can only see you on TV Kiki
No, it's a Netflix exclusive release!
Oh then I can look at it again right away Kiki
But that deal should have come out years ago!
But why was the deadline delayed?
The water level was so high that they fought with Netflix!
Wow then I'll have to check it out when I come out again Kiki
Kiki, that's right. Netflix is finally giving in and releasing it next year!
Oh, so the production company won? I'm looking forward to it Kiki
Kiki, that's right~ I have to watch the original broadcast too~
When you hear news that it's out, tell this little girl right away Kiki
I think you can just press the button that appears on the main screen while watching Netflix?
I don't know the title, I just passed by Kiki
Sister, have you tried Rosé Tteokbokki?
Yeah, I tried it
That's delicious
Sister, have you tried the Yeopddeok Rose?
Yeah, I tried it
It's delicious for the price
Oh really? Isn't it almost 20 thousand won?
I know you can do that much, you're awesome
Kiki, but isn't 20,000 won a bit expensive?
It's a bit pricey for tteokbokki, but it's delicious haha
I admit that Kiki
How many people ate?
I ate with four people at the hospital
I see. Is that enough for four Kikis?
I ate it with the female teachers and it was perfect.
Oh really? What's in there?
I ate it with rice cakes and ramen noodles
But isn't yeop-tteok spicy?
It also had a mild flavor, so I ordered that.
Sister, what is the cause of the smell in our house?
Damp smell and mold on your clothes?
Gosh, I've never cleaned my washing machine before!
Just put the washing machine fabric softener in it and run it.
Can I just put in some fabric and turn it on?
Yeah, if you just put in some fiber and turn it on, it will smell good.
Oh really? How do I wash it?
First, if there is a stain, wipe it off with a sponge.
Pong Pong? Just something you use when you're not washing dishes?
Yeah, that's right. Then just put it in the washing machine and turn it on.
Okay, so how do you clean the washing machine itself?
There's even a cleaner specifically for washing machines.
Do they sell that at Daiso?
Yeah, my friend said they sell it at Daiso.
Oh, I guess I should go there tomorrow!
Yeah, let's go and do some shopping at Daiso.

I entered the month of March ㅠㅠ I feel bad
Oh, but that's a training camp, so don't you have to go somewhere else after 4 weeks?
It's a training camp, so I'll probably go somewhere else in 4 weeks.
If it had been March, wouldn't it have already gone somewhere else?
Yeah, I got assigned to Gangwon-do.
Oh Kiki, it must be really cold there right now.
It's not that cold, but it's just starting to get cold.
Oh, Gangwon-do, I went to the farthest place.

Is this the place you've been going to since middle school?
Yeah, I've been hanging out with friends since I was in middle school.
I see. How long have you been going there?
I went until middle school 2nd year and then quit.
By the way, why did you quit then?
Because I like playing with my friends ㅠㅠ
Kiki, I admit that
When you play, you have to play!
But I regret not studying ㅠㅠ
Kiki, that's right, but if you go back then, it won't be okay~ It's okay~

Yeah I want to do that right now haha
Kiki Oh, are you talking about marriage with your boyfriend?
I don't think my boyfriend likes it that much though
Huh? Why? Is it too early now?
I don't know, maybe because he's younger than me ㅠㅠ
Oh, I see. How old are you?
Yeah, we're 4 years apart
24 years old haha
Oh, then it's still too early to think about marriage!
Yeah, I should do it when I'm around 30 haha
When Kiki's older sister was 30, when her boyfriend was 30?
My boyfriend said he should get married when he is 30
Oh, then I have to wait 6 more years!?
Oh, I see. It's hard. It's hard to wait.
You said your sister was raising a cute Bichon, right?
Yeah, there's a Bichon
So pretty I could die
How do you groom your baby?

Yangyang? Did you go play in the water there?
Yeah, I really like Yangyang, Gangwon-do. It's fun.
Kiki Oh my gosh, how many hours does it take to get from Nonsan to Yangyang?
I had fun singing with my friends for about 2 hours haha

Wow, do you know player Shim Seok-hee?
Yeah, I know, I know, but why?
Do you know the coach who sexually assaulted player Seom Seok-hee?
Oh my gosh, totally awesome. Who is this?
There's a person named Jo Jae-beom who harassed Shim Seok-hee!
Wow, that's scary, really. Why are you doing that?
I don't know, this guy says it's corporal punishment, but this isn't it.
Ah... still, he's a strange person;
That's why our Jo family is getting cursed at because of him!
Hey, this is seriously the end of the world, it's the end of the world haha
Kiki, that's right, this guy ended up getting 5 years in prison!
I also need to be careful and not use corporal punishment. It's scary haha.
Kiki, what would a sister have to do to scold someone!
Yeah, I'm kind-hearted so I can't do that.
Kiki, right? I can't do that either~
Yeah, I don't think you'd do that either.
Sister, have you ever traveled abroad?
Yeah, I went to Japan with my boyfriend.
Anywhere else besides Japan?
Um, I haven't been to Japan yet ㅠㅠ
Then, you've never been to Singapore, right?
Yeah, I haven't been there
I really want to go
Sister, this is your chance
Singapore travel restrictions have been lifted!
Have you been there?
I'm jealous, that would be fun
Kiki No, I couldn't go.
So I'm going this time!
I couldn't go because of Corona, but I should go too
Kiki Ah, but I don't think I can go right now even if it weren't for Corona!
Wow, really, why do you think you can't go? Haha
Kiki, right now it's been released here and people from all over the world are going on vacation to Singapore, it's total chaos!
Oh, it's really too bad ㅠㅠ I want to go...
Me too Kiki, our travel agency's homepage is paralyzed right now!
Oh really, then let's go next time
Sister, have you ever bleached your hair?
I've bleached my hair a lot haha
What is the most unique color your sister has ever used?
I've had gray hair
Doesn't gray require at least bleaching three times?
I bleached my hair 4 times
Wow, is your hair okay, unnie?
My scalp was so itchy I almost died
Kiki, right? ㅜㅜ Oh, but did the color come out well?
Ah... It hurts even thinking about it now, but it turned out well
That's fortunate, that must be a considerable amount of money!?
Yeah, if you ask me to do it again, I can't do it ㅠ
Kiki Wow right I think so too
How much did it cost?
170,000 won? That's about it ㅠㅠ
Oh, that's all you got? Is it cheap?
It was my friend's beauty salon haha DC
Sister, how is your health these days?
I'm taking medicine because I feel so dizzy ㅠㅠ
Oh my gosh ㅜㅜ Sister, you said you had a headache since last time!
I'm taking medicine for kidney stones. I feel dizzy.
Stone disease? What kind of disease is that?
Because of the stone in my ear? I went to the ENT clinic.
Wow, then I have to have the stone pulled out of my ear?
I'm having a dizzy spell because my cochlea is damaged
How did a stone get in your ear?
They say it can happen when you're stressed or something
Oh my gosh ㅜㅜ I'm so sad
Why are you so stressed!?
So don't drive and just rest ㅠㅠ
It's because of work
Oh, I see. Sister, go on vacation.
I'm so stressed out because of work
I don't have a vacation
ㅜㅜ Oh my god, that's why your health isn't getting better!
I used up all my vacation time haha I feel so tired
Sister, have you ever traded second-hand items?
Yeah I've tried it haha carrot
Carrots, carrots? My sister is going crazy over carrots right now!
Yeah I put my shoes on the carrot Kiki
Kiki, really? What kind of shoes did you put up?
I sold my Nike shoes to my baby
It's probably a girl, right?
What size are you, sister?
220 Nike shoes for 3,000 won haha
Wow, unnie, your feet are really small?
Yeah, my feet are small and I'm short too ㅠㅠ
Oh, I see. But it's Nike. You sold it for 3,000 won?
Yeah, that way it sells well and I wear it for a long time.
But isn't that selling it too cheap?
If you sell it for a high price because it's a baby, I won't buy it
I gave you DC
Kiki, I love this warm deal so much~
Yeah, I felt warm too, haha
Sister, do you have a favorite actor these days?
I like Kim Seon-ho ㅠㅠ
You are so handsome
These days, Kim Seon-ho syndrome is no joke!
The sea village chachacha is so fun ㅠㅠ
That's right, Get Village Chachacha is #1 on Netflix right now!
You look so good together with Shin Min-a ㅠㅠ
It's fun, Nexple
Kiki, that's right, I beat the Netflix squid game right now!
The Netflix squid game is also so fun, it's awesome
Kiki is right but I haven't seen it yet
Ah, really, look at it quickly!
Kiki No, I'll just go for a drive when I'm done~
If you don't watch, your friends won't play with you.
Make sure to drive straight
Kiki Aah, somehow all the kids talk about Kim Seon-ho
Yeah, really, my friends don't talk to me either
Kiki: So, how many episodes have you watched so far?
I watched up to episode 11 haha
Sister, have you been to the drive-in theater in Sejong?
Yeah I went there with my friends and it was great
Really? My friend said it wasn't that great!
I sell a lot of food and it's really good.
Really? They sell popcorn there?
Yeah sell popcorn haha caramel
Oh my favorite!
Sister, what did you see there?
Yeah, that's my favorite too
I saw the devil
Have you seen the devil? Who is it!?
Yeah, that's Choi Min-sik and Lee Byung-hun
If it's Choi Min-sik, is it the person Lee Young-ae was in that hit movie?
What is the name of that movie
I don't remember
Kiki, aren't you the actor who appeared in Kind Goldja?
Yes, that's the person from Kind Goldja
Kiki Oh, right, did you see that movie too?
Yeah, I saw it, it was really fun
Sister, you go to work without eating breakfast?
Yeah, I don't really
Choose sleep Kiki
Kiki, I see. I'm going to eat breakfast and go to work now.
Why? Do you eat breakfast every morning?
Oh, but instead of rice, just eat something like millet powder!
Ah, I also have some soy milk.
I'm eating soy milk and oatmeal~
Oatmeal is delicious, but my jaw hurts when I chew it in the morning Kiki
Kiki, now I have to buy it with milk~
Oh, you're eating while you're getting ready
Kiki, that's right. My millet powder comes in a container for one day, so all I have to do is add soy milk and I'm done!
Oh, that's really thorough.
I eat almond breeze
OMG! I love Almond Breeze too, but I especially like Unsweetened!
Unsweetened is delicious, but I'm not on a diet, so I'll go with the original!
Is the original sweeter than Unsweet?
I've never eaten it before!
If you eat that and then eat the original, you might feel it's sweet Kiki
What do you usually do on your days off, sister?
I'm just pretty much a homebody~
So at home, you just look at your phone all day?
Watching TV or something like that Kiki
Kiki, is there a TV at your house? It's a studio apartment!
Yeah, there's a TV too
Of course... there isn't one?
Yeah, we don't even have a place to put a TV.
Ah, I have a 1.5 room with a living room
Do you have a separate room?
Oh, I see. No, I live in a studio apartment.
I used to live in a studio apartment, but now I live here and I love it Kiki
I can't stand the smell
Kiki ha, I really want to fight the old man downstairs
The smell of cigarettes always comes up,
Are you blooming at home?
This is the worst, really Kiki
Oh, I kept talking to the landlord and the landlord talked to that man too, but it didn't work!
Wow, that's amazing. It's just a mess. What is that? Kiki
Kiki ha but I live in ** so I'm afraid I'll get stabbed so I'll just stay here Kiki
Ah, there are a lot of people at Shillim Kiki ** ㅠ Be careful
When are you planning to buy a car, sister?
I'm looking forward to next year ㅜㅜ ha
Next year is almost here!
No, I'm going to live after one summer, so I need to take care of myself first, Kiki
But why do you suddenly want to buy a car?
I feel like my quality of life will change Kiki
Kiki, do you know how much your insurance premium is?
They say there are about twenty of them, but is this the first time?
Huh? You're talking about 200,000 won a month?
Yeah, I think that's what it is, right?
Yeah, if you calculate it by year, it's 2.4 million won, haha.
But I think it would be more comfortable if there was something ㅜㅜ
I admit that Kiki
What's the first thing you'll do when you buy a car?
Let's go to the beach! Let's go for a drive ...
Kiki Oh, your boyfriend will be sitting in the passenger seat now~
Will we meet again by then? Kiki
I don't know either
Sister, since when have you been working at your current company?
I think it's been about 2 years since I've been here Kiki
Oh really? I'm 10 months old now and I'm still a baby~
Yeah, young man, I'm holding back because of tomorrow's filling.
I feel like quitting my job
Kiki, did you get hired with that too!?
Yeah I went around for a bit and got tied up for 2 years. Ugh.
Kiki, isn't that supposed to be liberated in two years?
I have 8 months left hahaha I give up
Ahh Kiki no, it's okay because 8 months will pass quickly~
Yeah, I should think positively. Ugh, Kiki.
Kiki: Then then~ Are you close with the staff there?
Just say it, employees are just coworkers
I like to leave a tribute
What do you mean it's good to leave a tribute?
They say it's good to take a break... It's called Heon
Ah, so they also call it a term
Kiki, are you Moonjini?
No Kiki I misspoke, sorry sorry
Sister, did you see the incident with the female sergeant who committed suicide recently?
Yeah ㅠㅠ I saw that, you know, that gaslighting thing?
No, the female army and navy sergeant who committed suicide due to a sexual harassment incident ㅜㅜ
Hey, what's that?
Are you talking about that sexual assault in the car?
Oh right, that's the army,
Recently, another Navy member committed suicide due to sexual harassment.
Wow, seeing something like that makes female soldiers scary
So ㅜㅜ But did you know that the naval officer was buried right away?
There are so many things you don't know about being in the military ㅠㅠ
That's right. The reason there aren't any articles about soldiers committing suicide in military bases is because the military blocks them all!
Yeah, that's right, they all say that ㅠㅠ
Hey, do you know what happened to the perpetrator of the female sergeant incident in the army?
Surely you're not just walking around ^^
No, he committed suicide, wow, that's awesome, right?
I think I saw this article. Kiki committed suicide. ㅡㅡ
He said he committed suicide the day before appearing at the police station.
I guess there was something wrong
Why is there chaos
Sister, how did you know about tomorrow's learning card?
Tomorrow's learning card? Is that supported by the government?
Oh, you said it was called the Youth Tomorrow Filling System, right!?
Ah Kiki, yeah I know that one and this one are different
Kiki, that's right, sis. How did you find out about that and apply?
I knew it from the beginning, but I tried it because other teachers said they were doing it!
I see, what did you learn from that, sister?
Huh? This isn't something you learn, it's just a system~
Huh? Then I guess I did it with the Tomorrow Learning System.
I got my accounting license with this!
Ah, I keep confusing it with Youth Tomorrow. Kiki
I haven't tried the Tomorrow Learning System!
Oh right, the youth system is half the salary given to the company and half to the country, right!?
No, it's not a salary, it's a big lump sum of money~
You're all wrong, Kiki
What on earth do I know!?
Kiki, what the hell do you know?
I'm more confused
Kiki, I'm sorry, that's why you shouldn't know people vaguely~
I guess that's possible because I didn't do it ㅜㅜ I understand
Sister, you said you're 21 now!?
Yeah right, I'm a fresh 21 year old haha
Did you say you're graduating from college soon?
I know I'm graduating next year, but I'm not sure.
Are you looking for a place to work?
I think I'll know for sure when I come to the internship this time Kiki
Sister, did you say that your major is watermelon?
Yeah, but first you have to pass the national exam to get a job.
National exam? Are you preparing for a qualification?
No, you absolutely have to take the national exam for the medical field.
Then you can get your license!
Oh right ㅜㅜ When can we see that?
I saw it before I graduated and I guess I'll graduate?
I see. If I don't get that, I won't be able to graduate?
I'm graduating, but I have to keep going because I have to study to take the national exam...
Oh, I guess it's only a few times a year that you can have noodles.
This is a once a year opportunity
So I remember deciding to live and die
Sister, do you have a boyfriend?
Yeah, I have a boyfriend for over a year now lol
I see. Is your boyfriend your college classmate?
Maybe so?
Other fruit
Last week, Kiki and I came to my house to play.
Oh really? Did you introduce yourself to your parents?
No, it's my house!
I spent all my money buying meat and doing other things.
Oh, you went to your sister's house?
How are you? Do you look good?
In my eyes, they're both babies, but the age difference is so big ㅜㅜ
Kiki: That's right. Your boyfriend is 21 too, right?
Yeah Kiki, they're both really tall and tall, so I'm a dwarf...
Kiki, I'm so jealous ㅜㅜ
How tall is your younger brother?
I'm a little over 176cm and my boyfriend is probably over 180cm
I heard it's bigger
Wow, that's awesome. Did you say you were 160?
No I'm more than that
Still I think I'm a hobbit Kiki
Kiki Ai, you're on the tall side too!
No, I'm the smallest in my house ㅠ
Does your cat have any pain?
I recently went to the hospital because my ear hurt.
How did you get hurt like that?
It was raised like a mosquito bite and it kept itching and bursting.
Then isn't that something like dermatitis?
But there are no wounds in either place ㅠㅠ
So is that a good deal?
I don't need to take any medication or anything?
Yeah, they just prescribed ointment, but I don't know either Kiki
Kiki, how much did the hospital bill cost?
This much? I feel relieved because they said it was okay.
Oh, I'm glad it didn't come out as much as I thought.
Yeah, that's right, but I kept scratching my ear.
Change the feed
Oh, I see. Was it because you changed the feed recently?
Is that so ㅜㅜ I haven't been scratching much lately
Thank goodness ㅜㅜ Don't get sick, kitties~
That's right, when you're sick, my heart hurts ㅠ
Sister, who are you going to exercise with today?
I'm going to run alone hehehe
Oh really? You suddenly want to run? Kiki
Yeah, I want to get some fresh air and sweat a little.
So, are you going to run about 3 kilometers this time too?
Yeah, if you wear a windbreaker and sweatshirt, it's no joke.
Wow where is the windbreaker brand?
Oh, that place is famous for its sportswear ㅠㅠ It's not like Nike
Oh, isn't that Sechkies by any chance?
Leggings are it!
But the windbreaker is a sweatshirt Kiki
Kiki: I see. Don't you bring anything with you when you exercise?
Yeah, I don't pack anything extra and just go out lightly
Do I not even need to bring water?
I'll give you an Apple Watch, it's so cool! I'll just go home and drink it
Wow Kiki Apple Watch~ Check my heart rate~
When you get angry, keep breathing Kiki Knock Knock
Sister, do you know that claw game we played when we were little?
Yeah, that's a hundred won, how much did you pay for it?
Kiki, right, sis? Have you ever won first place?
No, never once, always second place
Kiki Hehe, what did you give for second place when you were a student?
What were you eating? Junk food
But I don't even remember
I'm in second place and they only give me junk food!?
I won first prize once~
Wow what did you get
I'm so lucky
Latte was the number one hamster!
That's why I raised it hahaha
Wow, hamster Kiki, I raised a hamster too ㅠ It's disgusting
But the best prize is definitely the cultural gift certificate!
But there are some kids who are really good at that kind of thing Kiki
Yeah Kiki but they're basically the ones who spend a thousand won each!
But even a thousand won was precious back then, you know that ㅜㅜ
That's right Kiki, back then ice cream was 100 won!
Yeah, you know that long one, that one's 100 won Kiki fruit flavored
Sister, have you ever been on a family trip?
Yeah, I go once a year!
Oh really? You come here a lot?
But these days, I haven’t been able to go for about two years because of Corona…
Oh my gosh ㅜㅜ I couldn't go at all last year ㅜ
I'm an adult and I paid to go and see the event ㅜㅜ
How much do you collect as membership fees when you become an adult?
So my mom is really depressed
Kiki, I paid for it all
Kiki, really? Your sister doesn't have many family members, right?
Yeah, I got a place to stay and paid the security for less than 1 million won. Kiki
Dad just makes rice
Wow, but 1 million won is a lot of money!
But I don't mind investing in my family haha
Wow, it's really cool ㅜㅜ
Can I adopt a second child there?
No, that won't work
If you're tall, you can do it Kiki
That would be completely impossible
It's a pity, ugh ㅜㅜ
Kiki, I'll try again in my next life
Today, the water park opened in my armpit.
Why is Kiki so hot?
It was a bit hot this afternoon
Oh right, but I went out for lunch and it's a bit cold.
Really? Is it because the wind is blowing? Why is that, Kiki?
No, the sun was out here in the morning, but it disappeared around lunchtime!
It's so sunny here right now
Wow, what do you think of the autumn sunshine in Kiki's War?
It's so sunny and clear. There are so many clouds. Kiki
There are only clouds here Kiki
I'm wearing long sleeves, and the weather is perfect for wearing them~
I also wore a hoodie today, but it was a bit hot.
Sister, is Gyeotte Park open by any chance?
No, I work inside so I'm wearing a cardigan Kiki
Oh, unnie, are you wearing your company uniform!?
Yeah, that's right. You're personal clothes, right?
Right! We're just regular office workers!
Oh, then you must be really worried about clothes ㅜ
Sister, do you tend to feel swollen when you wake up in the morning?
Wow, the eyes, face, and legs are amazing ㅠㅠ
Kiki, should I also do Elsa's legs before going to bed?
Yeah, that's right, I used to do that, but I don't do it anymore Kiki
Kiki I didn't do it before, but I've been doing it recently.
Why do my legs hurt even when I sit down?
No, when I woke up this morning my legs were swollen ㅜ
When you do Elsa's legs, you have to do it a lot until you go numb
Kiki, that's right, but do you know why your body is swollen?
Why is it swelling?
Is it a hormonal problem?
Well, it might be a hormonal issue, but it's probably because your body is losing water!
Oh, so should I drink water often?
Oh, I need to do a lot of urination activities, and my legs usually swell up a lot, but do you know why my eyes swell up too?
Why are your eyes like this again ㅠㅠ
I drink water a lot...
When we sleep, our eyes are lying down, so moisture goes to the eyes, so that's why it's like that.
Oh really? Is that so?
It's creepy, the cause is Kiki
Sister, do you happen to know someone named Li Keqiang?
Don't you know that Li Keqiang is a person?
So, you know that the number one person in China is Xi Jinping, right?
The number two guy is this guy
Xi Jinping doesn't even know
Tell me who it is...
Nobody knows
So, did you see in the article that China is currently suffering from a power shortage?
No, I'm not interested in China at all, sorry.
Kiki No, I also found out from the article that they are having a hard time because of the power shortage.
Why is there a power shortage again?
Why does China have so many problems?
Kiki: That's why this guy named Li Keqiang is making contracts with Mongolia and other countries and running around like crazy!
Were you on good terms with Mongolia?
I just found out
Yeah, I guess it's not that bad with Mongolia
The problem right now is between China and Australia!
Oh really? Australian and Chinese Kiki are awesome. That's another one.
Originally, China had been importing most of its coal from Australia, but diplomatic issues arose and it was unable to do so, resulting in a power shortage!
Oh really? There are so many things going on.
I knew it first, Kiki
Right? Kiki, we import 3.9 billion tons from Australia alone, and now that supply has completely disappeared, there's bound to be a power shortage!
Wow, you've done so much
Kiki, you're my match
Sister, do you get your teeth scaled once a year?
No, I just do it every time tartar builds up
Really? Since you're from that lineage, you can just do it!?
Yeah I just do it when I feel uneasy
Oh really? Kiki, but how can you do that by yourself?
I do it while looking in the mirror with my hands haha
But is tartar buildup really visible?
Yeah I can't see it
And something got stuck on my tongue
Ah, I just touched it with my tongue and it feels rough
Could this be tartar!?
Yeah, that's right. If you feel that way, it's tartar, but it might be different from what I feel.
It's only been 2 months since I got my teeth scaled!?
Then maybe there's some food stuck in there
Well, does that feel overall right!?
Then maybe it's the feeling of teeth after removing tartar haha
Aha Kiki thank goodness
As expected, experts are different~
Kiki, don't worry, it was two months ago
I guess it'll be okay
Does your sister get cavities easily?
No, I don't floss well, Kiki
If you floss, you won't get cavities?
Besides brushing your teeth, you should also floss and brush your teeth haha
But if I do that, why do I get cavities!?
It varies depending on the saliva composition and varies from person to person.
As expected, there are some people who get cavities easily, namely Na Cho-rom.
Yeah, that's right. Even if you brush your teeth well, there are many people who get cavities.
Oh my gosh ㅜㅜ I went to get a checkup this time and lost 1 million won
Wow, I have to come here often. Kiki checkups are a must.
That's right ㅜㅜ I went there after 2 years and it was shocking and scary ㅜ
Oh no, that won't do
If you really go to the dentist, it costs money...
Yeah, when I was really young I cried because it hurt, but now that I'm an adult I cry because of the money.
So everyone is the same Kiki it's funny
Kiki ha, I should go and get checked more often from now on!
Yeah, I go for checkups often.
That's the best choice
Sister, there's something really funny, should I tell you?
What is it? What is it? If you don't get angry, you'll know - -? Kiki
My brother went to buy a keyboard?
Ah, I also want to buy a pretty keyboard Kiki
But the funny thing is, he confidently said he was going to trade on Carrot Market, but he ended up trading wrong. Kiki
Why did you get the Kiki stuff wrong?
Oh, right, I need to buy a keyboard to type on. You know that bubble wrap thing that's popular with kids these days? I'll buy that.
Ah Kiki dust I know that
Why did you buy it with that
Kiki No, that's called a keyboard-shaped bubble wrap? But I bought it thinking it was a keyboard just by looking at it Kiki
Ah Kiki, now I understand
Did you get scammed?
No Kiki, he just saw it wrong
I went and came back very lightly, the other person said Kiki
Ah Kiki, then you can see the items there and buy them
Kiki, but you already made a promise,
Kiki, I bought it for 2,000 won
Two thousand won is okay Kiki
Just donate, Kiki
Kiki, somehow the price of the keyboard is cheaper than I thought. Kiki
Why are you looking at it the wrong way?
Kiki is so funny
Sister, do you know what the Sakuranbo Dance is?
Yeah, that was popular for a while... you know
Do you know who made that popular?
Didn't the Japanese do it and have YouTubers make it popular?
The reason you became famous in our country is because of SiA Junsu!
Wow, really? I just found out
Did Sia Junsu sing it?
Oh right, I heard that SiA Junsu danced this as an event during his concert Kiki
Wow, that's why it became popular. I thought it was Kiki YouTuber.
Kiki, right? But I saw what Si-ah Junsu did? Kiki, you dance so well.
I should also look for something Siajoonsu sang Kiki
Kiki Oh look look, if you type in Shia Junsu Sakuranbo on YouTube, it will come up!
TVXQ is so good at dancing
Sia Junsu's song is good ㅜ
Kiki is right, it's the voice of heaven, Sia Junsu ㅜㅜ
But it was also creepy that Choi Kang Changmin got married...
Kiki Huh? When did Changmin get married!?
Wow, you didn't know you were married? Kiki
I did it with a normal person
Didn't you say your sister was crazy about Marvel movies?
Yeah right, I love Marvel so much~
Kiki: So, did you know that Venom 2 is coming out this time?
Yeah I saw the advertisement recently Kiki
Right? When do you plan on seeing your sister?
Oh but venom is kind of creepy ㅜㅜ
I like action
Oh really? Was Venom really that gross of a movie?
His appearance is so disgusting ㅜㅜ I'm drooling
Sister, have you seen Venom 1?
Yeah, I've seen that before
It's so gross Kiki Weck
Kiki: Then you won't be watching the one that came out this time?
Yeah I don't want to watch it because it's disgusting ㅜㅜ
Do you see?
Oh, I thought it was fun so I'm going to watch it a second time!
Wow Kiki that's funny
But it's fun haha
Yeah~ It only takes 1 hour and 30 minutes~
Let's go see it together~
Okay, let's go and reserve a ticket to a nearby movie theater.
Is your sister a breakfast eater?
No I'm really far from breakfast Kiki
Oh Kiki, I used to be like that too, but I eat it more often these days!
Oh, are you waking up early now? Kiki
Kiki, no, I'm going to work and eating!
What? Do you have company breakfast too?
Is it really that good?
Kiki Woong,? Our company goes out to eat lunch,?
Oh, so you're taking breakfast to work? Kiki
Kiki Ong Ong, do you know what you're taking?
Hey, what are you taking with you? Kiki
I eat it mixed with Otomeel and Almond Breeze~
What? Isn't that a diet menu? Kiki
Kiki's on a forced diet! It wasn't like that before!
But I might gain more weight because I ate breakfast
Oh man, I'm just turning into a pig
The saying that we live to eat is true, Kiki
Please fix the curtains in my house.
Sorry, I haven't tried that either...
Oh, no, how did the landlord fix it?
Is that what you used to do before?
I fixed it last time because it broke down againㅜ
But I feel bad about using it again because it broke down ㅠㅠ
So when I looked at this, it seemed like the original fastener was a bit loose!
Oh, so I guess I just need to fix the fixture?
Well, there are three, but one of them is a bit spread out!
Please tell the owner again ㅠㅠ
I guess so, but you noticed me last time too ㅜ
Wow, what do you mean by that? - I paid for it.
Kiki No, it was an original option.
I just found out that that's included in the options haha
Oh my, they said everything was optional, even Kiki's cutlery haha
Kiki, huh, even the dishes?
But I can't use something that someone else has used ㅠㅠ
My sister does a lot of deliveries.
When did you check your tires?
Yeah, if something seems strange while riding, get it checked out and such
Kiki looks like she's two months old!
Kiki, but I've been riding for 4 years and changed 8 tires. What do you think?
Wow, you change it every two years? Kiki
I think it changed about once a year.
Oh, did you change it like that?
Oh, right, but I also feel like I've been scammed.
But why do you change it so often? ㅠㅠ
No, it said it was punctured and torn and so on,
Ah, that can't be helped...
It's true that it needs to be changed ㅠㅠ
Ha, but there were things that didn't need to be changed.
No, if you do that you'll be in big trouble ㅠㅠ
It's safe to change tires!
Phew, ㅜㅜ My house is in the countryside so it's a gravel field
So it could be more like that
Oh, so that's why the tires go out more easily ㅠㅠ
Just change to cheap ones often ㅠㅠ
Okay, how about 500,000 won for 4 wheels?
Wow, it seems so expensive ㅠㅠ
Are you looking for a part-time job right now?
Yeah we're always saving Kiki
Oh really? It's so hard that people quit often?
No, it's the countryside so people can't be found ㅠㅠ
Oh, I see. There aren't many young people there.
Yeah, they're almost all elderly ㅠㅠ And no one comes here to work ㅠㅠ
Right ㅜㅜ I know an older brother who lives there. Should I ask him?
Oh, is he playing right now?
Yeah, as far as I know, you hang out with your friends all the time!
Kiki Oh, then ask me!
Can you do this for a long time? ㅠㅠ
Hmm, but I'm still a job seeker so I don't really know ㅜ
Ah, then I can't disappear once I get a job, no, no ㅠㅠ
Aah ㅜㅜ Hmm, it's really hard to find people there ㅜㅜ
Yeah, that's why I'm always here ㅠㅠ
Ahh Kiki, I'm glad I have a sister!
Kiki That's why I can't go on vacations like this ㅠㅠ I'm sad
Sister, have you ever been to see your boyfriend?
My boyfriends are all veterans Kiki yumhwahahaha!
Ah, so you're just like me, sister?
Then Kiki, you've never been a bear before
Kiki, my sister is a forced bear goddess~
Why are you forcing me Kiki?
Didn't you meet a soldier?
Yes, my boyfriend is a soldier.
Same age as me haha
Wow, unnie, you're really meeting a baby?
Kiki Yeah, that's right, that's why they always tease me by calling me your brother-in-law's brat~
Kiki, are you two close friends?
Kiki Ung is the same age as me, so we became close quickly!
Yeah, I guess so, Kiki
I think I'll see your scars later too Kiki
Kiki, if you do that, she'll die lol
He's working in Anmyeondo right now!
I guess your job is a soldier ㅠㅠ
It'll be hard to meet you ㅠㅠ
Yes, it's really busy right now because it's the beginning.
I guess I should meet my boyfriend while being considerate of him ㅠㅠ
Sister, do you have any qualifications you want to get?
I don't have the energy to study right now ㅠㅠ
Oh my gosh ㅜㅜ Then is there anything you want to learn later?
Later on, is it more like a hobby rather than just a certificate?
What is it? My sister started as a barista Kiki
Oh barista, are you okay Kiki?
I want to do crafts!
Oh, there's a place that does that across from the high school on that street!
Oh really? What do they make there?
Oh my god, I made a vanity table and a tissue box there!
Kiki, isn't that just something you made? Kiki, so cute.
That's Hanji craft, just stick it on and you're done!
Ah, Korean paper crafts seem like something worth trying. Kiki, is it fun?
Oh my gosh!
I still have it at home!
I'll have to go check out your house later, Kiki.
Kiki is with the odds and ends of the world right now,
While I'm going to Kiki, I'll also go see Obok-i, haha!
Is your sister's mother working with you too?
Yeah, my mom did it too, but she's resting now ㅠㅠ
Oh my gosh ㅜㅜ You must be really tired? ㅜㅜ
Yeah, Mom, your body is tired so you are resting right now ㅠㅠ
Oh ㅜㅜ That's right
So that's why your sister is running around so busily?
Yeah... I used to specialize in delivery, but now that I'm trying to do Kiki serving as well, it's hard ㅠㅠ
Oh my gosh ㅜㅜ So, just you and your dad and your sister are doing it?
Yeah and my younger sibling helped me out a bit on the weekends ㅠㅠ
I see ㅜㅜ Weekends are the busiest, right?
Right... and I'm so busy during weekday lunches ㅠㅠ
What kind of people usually come for lunch on weekdays?
Many elderly people who farm here come here!
I see. You know that fall is the season of harvest, right?
Yeah, rice farming Kiki. Even without that, there have been a lot of customers lately ㅠㅠ
Kiki Ka, so just hold on for a bit
It'll be okay in winter ㅜㅜ
Yeah, that's right ㅠㅠ But you have to be busy to make money haha
I'm worried even when I'm not busy haha
Since when have you been thinking about marrying your current husband?
I didn't really have any thoughts of marriage, but at some point the topic of marriage came up and I think it just happened naturally!
Oh, so how many months have you been newlyweds now?
We are now 5 months old! Kiki
Oh wow, you're a totally newlywed couple~
Yeah, we're still a little newlyweds, Kiki
Not really haha
So, Kiki and her family set up their new home together?
Yeah, the two of us are living together now!
So, does your sister commute from home to the restaurant?
Yeah, that's right... So I'm a little uncomfortable right now ㅠㅠ
Why? Is it because the commute is too long?
Yeah, originally it was in front of the house, but it got farther away so Kiki
Kiki, to gain anything you have to lose something.
Did you get lost on your way to work after getting a husband?
Kiki Then, then, after work, I'll go and have a chat with my husband~
Not every day ㅠㅠ
They fight and stuff ㅠㅠ
Your husband doesn't like baby animals?
My husband is allergic to dogs ㅠㅠ
Oh, I see. ㅜㅜ Then, do you have any plans to raise reptiles?
Reptiles? Are you talking about iguanas or lizards? Kiki
Boohoo or turtle-like ones
A lot of people are raising turtles these days!
Ah, a turtle! I want to try raising one, but I think it'll be difficult ㅠㅠ
No, I said turtles are secretly easy!
Is it okay to just wipe the back skin? Kiki
Kiki, no, just give me the right temperature and delicious food!
Oh really? Then I guess I should check out the turtle Kiki
Kiki, I saw it on TV. A tortoise? They raise a lot of yellow tortoises!
Yellow turtle? What is that Kiki
First time listening to Kiki
There's this yellow turtle that can live up to 100 years!
Don't turtles originally live for over 100 years?
No! Mini turtles can't live like that!
Ah, that's what Mini said Kiki
I just thought turtles were talking
Sister, don't you and your husband do couple exercises?
I'm the only one working hard at home training, but Kiki sometimes joins me!
Kiki is cute. Kiki. Is it true that newlyweds gain about 5 kilograms on average?
Oh, I think that's right...
I'm blowing right now ㅠㅠ
Oh my gosh ㅜㅜ Are you maintaining it while doing home training?
Yeah, I wanted to take it out a bit, but it seems like it's just maintained Kiki
Kiki, I also need to go to the gym to maintain my figure.
They say that as you get older, it gets harder to lose weight ㅠㅠ
Wow, how old are you now and you're already saying something like that!
It's so hard to maintain life right now ㅠㅠ sob sob
Sister, do you eat salad once a day?
No, I eat a lot, Kiki
Ah, Kiki, make sure to eat vegetables at least once a day!
Do I have to eat a salad every day?
Well, eating vegetables helps with bowel movements and reduces gas in the stomach!
Oh, so I guess I'm constipated now... ㅠ
Sister, have you ever played a 19+ couple game?
Oh what is that
Hurry up and give me the link
Kiki, have you ever played a 19+ couple Jenga game?
Yeah, how was that? Was it okay? Kiki
Um, I don't know, Kiki, it doesn't seem like it's rated 19+?
Ah, it must be rated R for 19+!
Kiki: So if this is rated 19+, then what I'm thinking is, um, 39+?
Ah... what? Isn't this just a kids' game?
Kiki, I think it's a bit like that
I think it would be good for couples who are just starting to date, not just long-time couples like us!
Ah, the guys I just started dating... I'm married?...
Kiki Aah, then Sister, I guess I'll have to make a 49+ version.
No, I'll ask for 60 gold Kiki
That needs to be sorted out haha
Kiki Aah, are you looking forward to the Twilight Couple's Jengar?
Okay, I'll try it and let you know what I think, Kiki
Kiki Oh, okay Kiki, or else my sister will make it and sell it!
No, then I'm going to be burdened because my business is going so well.
Where did you say you went on your honeymoon, sister?
Our Jeju Island... Corona isn't going away ㅠㅠ
Oh my gosh ㅜㅜ I bet you went to Jeju Island and wore a lot of masks ㅜ
Yeah, it was hot and humid and a mess ㅠㅠ
Oh Kiki, it was May and it was that hot?
Yeah, the weather was nice back then so it was hot ㅠㅠ
Then the sky photo would have come out really pretty!
Yeah, the pictures turned out pretty so I was satisfied haha
Kiki, thank goodness! Jeju Island will get hotter starting in May.
Yeah, then Jeju Island is just starting haha because the weather is nice!
Kiki, what did you do in Jeju Island?
I think we went on a food tour, Kiki
I just ate so much
Oh Kiki, should I go to Jeju Island and eat peanut ice cream?
Isn't that obvious?
I went in and ate it!
Kiki, that's right, when you go to Udo, you have to eat peanuts!
Yeah, I ate that and Jjajangmyeon and Kiki Burger!
What's the weather like in Nonsan right now?
The weather in Nonsan right now is very sunny and clear.
Oh, this is so good
The weather in Seoul is also good.
Maybe because it rained yesterday, the weather is really nice today.
Kiki, that's right, Over! It was supposed to rain all week!
Oh, but it only lasted two days? Kiki
Ah, I've been coming here every day from Monday to Friday Kiki
Oh, then is my memory weird? It feels like it's been two days...
The weather in Seoul and Nonsan is a bit different~
Well, it's a bit far so it's different ㅠㅠ
Yeah it's been humid here all along ㅜㅜ
Your little brother came there and said that ㅠㅠ
That's why it rained ㅠㅠ
Kiki Oh my right, it was on my little brother's stomach!
I came down again a few days ago and it looks like it rained here Kiki
Kiki, oh my, Kiki, that's right, I said I'd go to the lower part of the country again,
... So now he's gone abroad...
The weather is nice, Kiki
Do you know my older sister, volleyball player Da-young Lee?
Dayoung? No, I only heard about Youngkyung and Heejin? Kiki
Oh right, I didn't know he was married!
Oh, is that player also active this time?
No, they said he was an ordinary person, but they divorced after 3 months.
Hey, why did you get divorced after only 3 months of marriage?
Oh, you said you got divorced after dating for 3 months?
What the heck, why are you like this Kiki, wake up!
What the hell is true Kiki
It's true that Kiki and I broke up on bad terms!
How did you break up for such rumors to spread?
You said you were holding a knife again while fighting?
Oh my gosh, which side was holding the knife?
The girl's height is similar to that of the guy's?
Wow, so that's what the volleyball player said? That's awesome ㅠㅠ
Yeah, the content of the message was scary, too.
Wow, then it's worth breaking up ㅠㅠ
We can never live together!
The person who won the Teacher of the Year award in the US had sex with his student?
Wow... but since it's America, I thought it was open, so it's not shocking, but it's shocking Kiki
Kiki: So, do you know how old your disciple is?
Oh, you're not that young, are you?...
14 years old, what do you think? Confucian girl?
Wha... If you're 14, you're in your second year of middle school... something like that?
But first of all, their development is different from that of middle school students in our country.
Of course it's different... but the spirit will be the same, right?
I guess so, but how did someone like this receive such an award?
What I'm saying is... I guess you shouldn't judge just by looking at the outside. ㅠㅠ
Yes, sensei, you gave me so much love,
Kiki overflowing love Kiki so funny Kiki
You really gave me so much love Kiki
Kiki, so this sensei is in prison now
Of course I have to go ㅡㅡ
Those who do wrong should be punished!
Yeah, I think it was a few years from what I understand
Yeah, and then you have to get buried there!
Did your sister get her eyebrows tattooed or something?
Yeah I've had my eyebrows tattooed Kiki
Oh really? When did you do it?
I did it when I became an adult, but I couldn't do it because I got sick after that.
Kiki: Then you must have retouched it twice?
Yeah, I did it twice then! Kiki
It hurt so much ㅠㅠ
Sister, did it hurt because you used the embossing technique?
What is that... I just did it back then ㅠㅠ
Are you not sick these days?
No, I was sick when I did it too hehe,
What the heck Kiki, why are you pretending not to be sick? Kiki, you're making me excited
Kiki, even after applying anesthetic cream, tears kept flowing down your face.
But if you want to be pretty, you have to take risks ㅠㅠ What should I do...
Kiki, my eyebrows are red right now, I didn't get them retouched,
Oh my... Then go and do it quickly ㅠㅠ
That's scary Kiki
Kiki No, just put it on top and go.
Oh, there you are, drawing and such... Kiki
Then when is your day off, sister?
I have Mondays once a week!
If I do this, won't my body hurt a lot?
But still ㅠㅠ Just rest a bit during the day and you'll be fine!
My sister is truly an iron woman. Amazing!
Iron Man, no Kiki ㅠㅠ
All restaurants are like this...
ㅜㅜ But your restaurant is really busy!
Yeah right... we're going crazy ㅠㅠ
By the way ㅜㅜ Are your waist and legs okay, unnie?
It really hurts ㅠㅠ
I think it's time to take care of it ㅠㅠ
Sister, do you know Elsa Dari?
Do that often!
I do that a lot Kiki
Oh, you should do that more often!
Otherwise my legs will be numb ㅜ
It's so swollen, so it's essential, essential!
Yeah, I also have a sedentary job so I get swollen often and do that often!
I just want to win the lottery and lie down comfortably...
Is your place also on the delivery app?
No we only take phone orders Kiki
I see. So that place is mostly filled with regulars?
Yeah, since you're elderly, using the app won't help ㅠㅠ
Kiki, that's right Kiki. Then how do you order delivery, Unnie?
We go out and buy it to-go and stuff ㅠㅠ
Oh, I see. I live in Seoul too, so I usually get it to-go!
Yeah, don't you think the delivery fee is a waste?
It's too expensive ㅠㅠ
That's right, if Kiki falls, her nose will touch it!
Yeah, that's what you have to do in those places, but I prefer to pay for delivery ㅠㅠ
I guess that's because my sister has a hard time ㅜ
Yeah, just lay down and let it roll around Kiki
How much does Kiki Nonsan usually charge for delivery?
I think 2,000 won or 3,000 won is the basics!
There are places that cost 4-5 thousand won. It's a waste.
Ah, sometimes it happens like that ㅠㅠ
Then I won't order it Kiki
Sister, is there any music you listen to often these days?
I'm Kyeongseo Yeji. I listen to these guys' songs a lot. Kiki
Wow, a guy I know said he listens to her songs yesterday. Is there a new song coming out?
No, it's not a new song, but I listen to it all the time because I like Kiki so much
Kiki, really? Are you listening to any new songs these days?
I don't even know what new songs are coming out these days...
Sister, then don't you know about the SM girl group called Espa?
Ah, Next Level? Are they the ones who sang that song? Kiki
Oh yeah, a new song came out this time and it's really awesome!
Oh really? Then I guess I'll have to listen to it again, Kiki.
Wow, people's reactions were good too!
I think it's even more so when a new song comes out after a while Kiki
Kiki, no, I personally think that they are a group that surpasses Girls' Generation!
Oh really? But I haven't seen any girls who surpass Girls' Generation in our country yet. Kiki
No, she's really pretty, sings well, and is good at everything!
There's nothing idols can't do these days ㅠㅠ
Aren't you going on a movie theater date with your husband?
We're pretty good at dating, Kiki
Oh, what have you seen recently?
Xiangqi is popular these days, isn't it?
Hey hey when are you going to write~
I saw the voice now Kiki
Kiki A Voice is coming out as a movie?
That voice I know?
No, the drama is different
This is voice phishing!
Oh, I see. Who is the lead actor?
Byun Yo-han and Kim Moo-yeol appear in it, and Kim Moo-yeol's acting is really good. Kiki
Oh my gosh, Kim Moo-yeol! When did this come out?
I have to go see it right now!
Go see Kiki Eorung
This is really fun, I highly recommend it!
Kiki Oho, there's no female lead actress?
Uh...um, there is one, but it's not coming out these days Kiki
Really? Kiki, are Kim Moo-yeol and Byun Yo-han just the main actors?
Yeah right but Byun Yo Han looks really cool Kiki
The role is cool
What role did Hal Byun Yo-han play?
He got scammed and he's an ex-cop Kiki
So I went to China and caught the culprit and that's it Kiki
Oppa, I'm so hungry~
I've never had a younger sibling like you haha
Dad~ I want to eat some big chicken feet~
Aren't there more open places than there are here right now?
Yeah, but I can't eat it all by myself ㅜ
No, I can eat it all
Give it a try Kiki
Why are you trying to make me strong!
Kiki, you can honestly eat everything
No!? I can't eat it all!?
I saw you eat something like that before, it was amazing.
Kiki, back then we shared lunch and dinner~
Are you sure? I feel like I can eat it all in less than 30 minutes if I order it.
Kiki Nouno~ Ah, but boneless seems possible!
Yes, chicken feet are boneless, that's the truth Kiki
Kiki I used to be a bone person but I moved out and became a boneless person Kiki
Then it's really the best if it's easy to eat Kiki
Oppa, oppa, do you clean the house?
Should I do it?
I have a mommy!
I envy Kiki, does your mom clean often?
Well, I think you should come home, Kiki
You're so neat
Oppa, help me out too~
No, I don't, helping just makes things worse Kiki
Kiki: Then, Mom will clean your room too?
Yeah I don't really clean up much with my own hands Kiki
Actually, my mom cleans my room too~
Kiki but you're out now so you have to do it
Oh right, the studio apartment doesn't tolerate even a single hair, Kiki
So did you put that rock on the beach? Kiki
Dol Dol has now changed the charging material 4 times
Wow, you must be losing a lot of hair too, Kiki
Oh Kiki and here it looks really good
Kiki, the flooring there seems to be a bit brighter Kiki
How many years has it been since you took the bus, oppa?
Bus? Regular bus? Or express bus?
Both! How much is the regular bus fare?
Isn't that around 1300 won now?
It's really creepy
1300 won This is from two years ago Kiki
Oh really? I think it's been over 8 years since I've taken a regular bus. Kiki
The regular bus fare is 1,500 won now, but they're raising it to 1,600 won!
But considering the current prices, it could be possible Kiki
That's right, but I heard there are a lot fewer people riding it now!
I wish the price of oil would go down a bit ㅠㅠ
Kiki, how much is gasoline right now?
I think it's 1700 won now!
Wow, a latte was 1,400 won! Awesome!
Don't lie
There can't be that kind of amount, right?
Seriously! It was around 1400 won until last year!
I remember it was 1500 won last year. Kiki
Oppa, is that your lifelong job right now?
Yeah, I guess it's just going to be a job for life, but I want to try other things too Kiki
Then, oppa, you should learn the skills!
No, my younger sibling who works is better than me Kiki
Kiki: So, you just have the title of president?
No, I'm just a screen, Kiki
Kiki: But even so, now that my parents are retired, my brother has to do everything!
But it hasn't been fixed yet, Kiki
Sure, you'll probably do it for another 20 years, right?
Won't it be harder for me then?
Kiki: Then what else do you want to do besides this?
Well, I want to try living while receiving a salary ㅠㅠ
Aren't you still receiving a salary?
No, we all just use cards so there's no standard for that Kiki
Oh my god, Kiki, so you don't have any emergency funds?
Yeah, just use whatever's left over
Did your brother say he was a driver when he was in the military?
Yeah, I'm a former driver, Kiki.
Are all the people in the dormitory where Kiki Oppa was also drivers?
No no, not all of them were drivers Kiki
Just a regular military police Kiki
If you're a military policeman, are you like a police officer in the military?
No, I'm just talking about the army, Kiki
Then, since you are a driver, you didn't have any training?
No, but I still received all the training.
Oh really? The drivers I know suck up to so much honey?
If there's work, you don't have to do it, but if there's no work, you don't get trained.
Is he a two-star driver who gets a free ride?
But those kids have to be accompanied by their wives too, Kiki
Kiki, you're right, you really drive like a driver Kiki
Secretary Kiki, you have to take your children to school too. Secretary Kiki, you have to take your children to school too.
Kiki and the kids to school?
That's creepy!
Yeah, I heard that a friend of mine said the same thing, Kiki
Oppa, is there anything you want to learn?
Well, I was a bit interested in security.
Bodyguard? Then I guess I'll have to learn judo?
Just because you're guarding doesn't mean you have to do judo unconditionally, Kiki
Anyway, shouldn't it be in the sports field?
Yeah, that's right, but if I were to learn, I'd like to learn boxing once Kiki
Oh boxing!? You know that you always start with jumping rope first?
Yeah, I know a guy who just jumped rope for a month and quit. Kiki
Yeah lol my friend ran away after ordering that too Kiki
But isn't it a bit too much to make them only jump rope for a month?
No, the basis of boxing is physical strength, so you have to jump rope for an hour without stopping!
Are you making me jump rope because of steps or something?
Yeah, I think so
You have to do it 3,000 times without stopping!
Oh, then I guess I'll run away too, Kiki
Kiki, when I was in high school, it was a 3 minute cut Kiki
Isn't that a lot of work? Kiki
Oppa, when is your father's birthday?
My dad was born in May, Kiki
So what did you do for your birthday this year?
This time, I gave you some pocket money since you didn't really want anything Kiki.
Oh, how much allowance did you give?
I just gave you 300,000 won, Kiki.
I have a problem right now!
Why is it your father's birthday too?
No, my dad retires in December!
Why worry when you retire and just rest?
I have to have a retirement party.
What should I give as a gift?
Ah, the retirement party isn't important, Kiki, you have to rest now!
Um, the gift is a blanket?
Hey, what? My dad has a lot of blankets.
Yeah Kiki, how about a blanket so you can just get some rest?
If my dad saw that, he'd say there's no need to spend a long time in a coffin!
Kiki: No, but I think you'll like everything!
My boyfriend is coming to my house tomorrow!
Wow, how long has it been since you guys last met?
Huh? You came and went yesterday too? Kiki
Huh? Didn't you say that you guys haven't been able to contact each other or meet up these days?
No, I worked overnight and came home to my house!
I guess that's because I see you more often than when I was in the countryside?
Yeah, that's right, but I hate hearing snoring so often!
Oh, I remember when we went out to play together before, Kiki
I don't think it was a problem back then?
Kiki, that's right, I wasn't a picky eater back then, but as I got older, I got more and more picky.
I guess my brother is very tired these days because he has a lot of work to do. Kiki
Yeah, but my ideal type is a man who doesn't snore!
Hey, aren't you snoring too? Kiki
No, I'm sleeping while laughing
That's scarier Kiki
I think you'll appear in my dreams Kiki
That's right, my brother woke me up and asked what was wrong.
That was when I was laughing and talking in my sleep!
Don't you think that if you laugh, something good will happen?
Kiki is so funny
This time, I took Merong for a walk for the first time in a while and he loved it!
Oh, did you bring Merong with you yesterday when you came?
Oh right, Merong is still so bubbly!
Kiki Merong was Happy Bob... I remember it clearly
Kiki, are Happy and Kongi doing well?
Yeah, it looks like that in the picture~ Depressing...
Hehe ㅜㅜ Has it been about 3 years since we went together?
Wouldn't it be two years?
We were supposed to go once a year, Kiki
Yes, that's right, it was a holiday last year!
Was the princess there the last time we went?
Princess? I don't remember very well ㅜㅜ
Is it Daedunsan? ㅠㅠ Anyway, I think I went somewhere nearby ㅠㅠ
Hurry up ㅜㅜ Merong went to the pension to play and that was the last time ㅜ
Kiki Merong, take me out and let me smell the ocean!
Oh, I should do that, but I don't have time ㅜ
Oh my, you must have had a hard time there too ㅠㅠ
Does your brother know how to play badminton?
I think that's totally professional level
Oh really? I don't know because I haven't seen Kiki~
You'll never win against me~
Kiki, are you also in the Nonsan Badminton Club?
No, I don't hit as hard as they do!
Kiki, I'm from that club, don't mess with me!
Oh, so you have to fight me?
Then~ I think men win too~
Hmm, I guess I'll have to check that out Kiki
Even if I wear sandbags on both my ankles, my brother can still win!
I praise you for that great confidence Kiki
Kiki, would you like to call in a round of dinner bets?
Then, even if I win, I can still afford that one dinner~
Kiki Oh, then let's have tuna for dinner~
Ah, then I guess I'll just bet and eat it Kiki
Honey, do you know how to play baduk?
I played a little bit of baduk with my father when I was young.
Kiki, I don't know what the rule is, even though I know it.
Yeah, I don't know either
Just leave it Kiki
How do you put Kiki?
I tried it on my phone and I don't understand a thing!
Just put mine together Kiki
But wasn't there a baduk academy near the house where my brother lived?
Oh, I think there was one before, Kiki
Right? I think I saw it there, but is it gone now?
I think my friend went there too, Kiki
It's not there right now
Right, I heard they teach abacus there too?
I don't know because I haven't been in, but Kiki
Have you done many interesting things besides baduk?
Kiki: That's right, but it seems like only really smart kids play Baduk!
Huh? Then I think I'll do really well Kiki
If only my mom had let me go to that academy back then, I'd be a member of Mensa now!
Oh, that's over ㅠㅠ
Moderation is key ^^
Oppa, we can travel to Saipan and Guam now!
Oh, is it solved there too?
I heard Singapore is now possible too Kiki
Oh, I see. The travel agency has released the product!
Wow, then I should have gone to Guam instead of Jeju Island ㅠㅠ
But isn't Guam really far from here?
Yeah, but considering the cost of Jeju Island, it's better to just go to a place like that ㅠㅠ
Right, I don't know when I'll be able to go to Guam again!
Yeah, I felt it because of Corona, but I have to go out a lot when I can Kiki
Yeah, but I also want to go to Singapore!
They say that country is so clean.
Kiki, really? Where is Singapore?
It should be relatively close!
What was Singapore famous for? Waffles?
There used to be a swimming pool there that was a hit. Kiki
Swimming pool? Are you talking about the pool inside the hotel?
Yeah, that's right, I'm on the rooftop, and they said the pictures came out pretty Kiki
The weather there was no joke, was it?
It was cold this morning, but it was hot again during the day ㅠㅠ
It was the opposite here!
It was hot in the morning and cold during the day!
I think it's better to be warm when going to work ㅠㅠ
No, I was drenched in sweat on the subway!
But I really want to eat oden, which is eaten when it's chilly ㅠㅠ
Kiki, is there a snack shop near our company?
The smell of oden soup there is overwhelming ㅜ
Ah, you must have really wanted to eat it every time you passed by there.
Yeah, but I'm embarrassed to eat it because it's on the street.
What do you care? I work to make a living, so don't worry about that!
I was afraid I would meet the company staff,
When you meet, say hello and have some before you go~
Kiki, do you do the math yourself? Kiki
Of course it is
While talking, shout out, &quot;Each person has money!&quot;
There are also thousand won tteokbokki there!
Wow, wow, for a thousand won I could get a cup of tteokbokki Kiki
So how much did you pay for Samsung stock?
I currently have an average purchase price of 78,000 won Kiki
Did you see the news this time? 60,000 electrons,
Yeah I saw it... It's so annoying
I bought that for over a million won, Kiki
Wow, is this true? When did you buy it?
I bought it when it first went up at 81,000 won, and then bought more when it dropped, lowering the average price by that much.
But I heard that the trend is continuing to fall, right?
Yeah, that's why I'm not going in now
If you're crying tears of blood, Kiki
There is another person besides my brother who is shedding tears of blood,
Is that the guy you're talking about?
There are many more besides Samsung...
Yeah, that Kiki guy
Hey, how many did you get bitten by, oppa!?
It seems like the stock market itself is at its lower limit right now ㅠㅠ
Oh my gosh ㅜㅜ It must be a field of blueberries now, right?
Yeah, that's right. I really want to see some red ones ㅠㅠ
But is there anyone rolling around in a red field these days?
If you don't know, there's someone crying, there's someone laughing, Kiki
There are bushfires in Australia again!
Why do forest fires start there whenever you do something? ㅠㅠ
I guess it's because the climate is so dry!
But still, many people say that living in Australia is nice ㅠㅠ
That's right ㅜㅜ There was a big fire the year before last too!
I want to go to Australia even if there is a forest fire
Koalas are almost completely wiped out by the Australian wildfires.
Oh my god, that won't work ㅠㅠ
Koala, so is it a rare species?
I think so too
As far as I know, it was originally an endangered species, right?
Wow, then we really need to do a good job of preserving koalas now ㅠㅠ
Yes, last time I said that 90% of the world's koalas were wiped out by wildfires.
I've never seen a koala before ㅠㅠ This is not right~
Oh, I think I saw it at the zoo haha
This is the first time I've heard that there's a koala in a domestic zoo~
Oh, I think I saw it when I was little!?
It could have all been your dream, Kiki
Are you grooming your eyebrows, oppa?
Oh, my lover does that all the time, Kiki
Kiki I also pluck my lover's eyebrows every day
He rips it off...
Kiki's a waxing lover...
Kiki Hey, you have that waxing machine too?
Right, aren't you his blog neighbors?
Oh right, that beard was your brother, huh?
Yeah, that's me...
I cried that day ㅠㅠ
Kiki, at that level, you didn't bleed?
Kiki, I think there was a little bit of blood, but you pretended not to notice.
Kiki, wow ㅜㅜ If it was to that extent, you would have really bled Kiki
So all my personal information was sold, Kiki
Kiki Oppa, did you shave your leg hair too?
No, I'm guarding that Kiki
My brother has thick hair too
Next time I'll bring you to my lover Kiki
Has your brother ever been hospitalized?
Yeah, I did it once before after an accident ㅠㅠ
Oh my, are you talking about a car accident?
Yeah, that's right. I spun around a few times while running on a rainy road.
Wow, is that an accident that even involved a barricade?
Yeah, one of my friends got off and lay down right away.
Oh my gosh ㅜㅜ You must have been hospitalized with a friend, right?
So when I asked him why he got down and lay down, do you know what he said?
You said it was because you were dizzy?
Kiki said he went out and lay down because he was scared that there would be a second accident.
Kiki, what if another car hits you? Kiki
I don't know, I listened to it too, it was so funny Kiki
Kiki, how many kilometers did you run back then?
Ah, I don't remember that well, Kiki
Who runs that fast in the rain?
So these days, when it rains, I'm scared to drive Kiki
My cousin went to a second-hand goods trade?
Huh? Are you sure it's not that little brother who went to buy a keyboard?
Oh right Kiki but you're using the wrong keyboard Kiki
Oh right, I got a call too, Kiki
I'm in touch with him Kiki
What the heck, you two are contacting each other without me!?
Kiki bragged to me about buying me a keyboard
I showed you mine before haha
Kiki, that's right, she said it was so sweet that she was going to trade with me for 2,000 won.
But after buying that, I went back to Daiso and bought it again? Kiki
Kiki, you're right, I should have bought a USB keyboard, but I bought a different keyboard Kiki
That's why you have to be careful when buying used goods, but Kiki is unlucky
Kiki So I went to Daiso and bought it for 5,000 won Kiki
But I think it's actually pretty good to use, Kiki
Uh,? You said it broke after hitting it a few times?
The dog must be really unlucky ㅠㅠ Why is it like that... Kiki
Kiki, you disappeared while chatting with me about that earlier
Kiki, you bought a different kind of thing than me
I guess mine is better
Did you watch the satirical YouTube video I told you to watch yesterday!?
Hey I can't watch scary movies
I could suffocate to death
No, the satire YouTube is what I told you to watch yesterday!
Oh, I thought you were talking about something scary
I haven't seen Kiki yet
Kiki, look at that quickly~
It's really funny~
How funny is that that you keep urging me like this, Kiki?
If oppa enjoyed the mirage video, this one will definitely be more fun!
Yes, Shingiru is really funny Kiki
It's still funny no matter how many times I watch it Kiki
Kiki, that's right, I saw it again while taking a bath yesterday!
I think I saw it again because I thought of you? Kiki
Kiki, that's right Kiki, but oppa, have you seen the videos of transgender YouTubers?
No I haven't seen Kiki. Is it funny?
It's so funny what you say Kiki
These days, everyone speaks with such a good sense of humor. I envy Kiki.
That's right Kiki, these days there are a lot of gay YouTubers and they talk a lot!
You should try it too, Kiki
You're pretty good at speaking~
Oppa, did you see Venom Two!?
Who did you see it with!
Who would you watch it with? Who would you watch it with? I watched it with that person.
Oppa, does your lover like Marvel movies too?
Yeah, he always checks that out, Madok Madok
Who's in Oh Kiki Venom 2?
There's a venom child appearing and Kiki
Oh, Venom's kid is the main character?
Yeah the dog came out and fought Venom
Oh, did you enjoy the Kiki movie?
It wasn't that long so I just watched it without getting bored Kiki
Why did it take several hours?
An hour and a half? It didn't even feel like two hours Kiki
Huh? If it's a movie, why is it so short?
Was the production cost insufficient?
It looks like it was made in a hurry... hmm
Kiki, are you hitting the car a lot there?
Kiki, you've been hitting walls a lot too
Kiki, jumping around the rooftops and breaking everything
What are you eating for dinner tonight?
I ate chicken today
Oh my gosh, I'm so jealous
Where can I eat chicken?
I ate Jikoba chicken
It was really delicious
Wow, wow, of course you mixed rice in there and ate it, right?
Of course, Jikoba has to mix rice to be true
Right, do you like spicy food or mild food?
Oh, of course I like spicy food
Kiki, that's right, Jikoba is spicy
But do you like your in-laws too?
Of course, you have to eat your in-laws' chicken with rice.
Isn't Kiki's in-laws' chicken really sweet?
The original food is sweet and salty
Kiki, I really want to eat the Supreme from my in-laws' house!
After a long time, I also crave for Supreme from my in-laws
Kiki Me too ㅜㅜ Ah, now that I think about it, Kyochon's Honey Combo looks delicious too!
Kyochon Honey Combo is also really delicious
Are you living alone now?
I live with my parents now
Do you have a dog at home?
We have two dogs in our house.
Kiki: So that's why I always hear puppy sounds when I talk to you on the phone?
Yes, keep barking to be touched
Kiki, are you barking because you want me to touch you?
Yeah, if you look at me, I won't bark.
Kiki, aren't your parents at home right now?
I don't really care about you
Kiki, but isn't your house an apartment?
No I live in a commercial building
I see. What do people say when a dog barks like that? Kiki
It's okay because there are no apartments around
Kiki Oh, your dogs are so lucky!
No one will say anything even if you bark all you want
How did you go to school when you were a student?
I took the train, I took the bus, I drove my own car, etc.
Did you take the train to school when you were in high school?
When I was in high school, I took the bus.
Oh really? How much was your bus fare back then?
When I was a student, it was 1200 won.
I see. How old are you now?
I'm 22 now, I'm old
Wow, you're old,
A latte costs a thousand won for a bus ticket!
It's 1500 won these days, but it's too expensive.
Right, are you living in Nonsan now?
No, I live in Jeonju now
Are the bus fares similar in Jeonju and Nonsan?
Oh really? I thought it was different in each region.
Kiki, no, it's different. The bus fare between Nonsan and Jeonju is the same!
Oh really I didn't know
I thought it was different
Do you have a part-time job right now?
I'm helping out at my dad's store.
Oh really? What does your dad do for a living?
My dad runs a restaurant
Do you know Codari?
Kiki, huh? I'm a killer of braised codfish!
The truth is that adding shiitake mushrooms to braised codfish is the best
Kiki, wow, I want to eat braised codfish for the first time in a long time!
Have you tried codfish ribs and seafood?
Huh? No? That feels like some kind of new trio?
It's really delicious, try it
Oh, can I eat that if I go to your house?
Of course our house's codfish is delicious
Wow, you guys were talking about your house, I'm definitely going to run there!
You are always welcome
I'll make it delicious for you when you come
Kiki, you're going to put some noodles in there too, right?
Of course, it's really delicious when mixed with sauce
How are your brothers?
Do you have a younger brother?
I have an older brother and a younger brother at home.
Oh, then how old are you now?
My brother is 25 years old now.
Then, you must have been discharged from the military? Pil-tung~
No, my brother lives in Canada and doesn't have to go to the military.
Oh really? Why are you in Canada now?
I went to college there and am still living there.
Oh really? Oppa, you must be really good at studying!
I want to deny it, but it's true...
Kiki, then when you come back from Canada, you have to go to the military, right?
No, you don't have to go there after getting a green card
Oh my gosh, Kiki, how long has it been since you last saw me?
I don't think I've seen you in about two years
Oh my gosh ㅜㅜ So we've only been doing video calls up until now?
No, I don't do video calls that often either
Are you studying now?
I'm currently preparing to transfer to another university.
Oh, really, where do you plan on going to college?
My parents want me to go to Jeonbuk National University, but not me.
So what is your major now?
My parents worked in the restaurant business, so I went to Sikyeong.
Food and beverage? My friend also graduated from food and beverage and he studied a lot!
Yeah, there's so much to study
ㅜㅜ I see. Then, does that mean I can go to Jeonbuk National University’s food science department?
I think so
I want to go to another department
But why do you insist on transferring the same fruit?
My parents want me to get a four-year degree
Kiki, where do you want to go after getting your four-year degree?
I don't want to get a job as a chef.
Kiki, you're not going to get a job after graduating from a 4-year food and beverage program?
I want to try something different
Are your parents running a braised codfish restaurant together?
Yes, my dad runs a big restaurant that serves braised codfish.
Kiki, I see. Are you doing it in Jeonju?
Not only in Jeonju but all over the country
Kiki, you're doing it so big, huh?
Yes, I'm busy building a factory this time.
Wow, awesome. Then you can eat your home-made braised pig's trotters at the mart?
We do not distribute to marts, but to restaurants.
I see. So you're running a business?
Yes, you are running a big restaurant business.
Kiki So, your father is either running a restaurant or looking after a factory now.
You run a restaurant now and also visit factories.
What is your mother doing?
Well, my mom is a housewife.
Oh, I see. So you don't run the restaurant together?
Don't do it separately
Only dad does it
Do you have a boyfriend now?
No, there isn't...
I'm so depressed
Why? Are you not dating or do you have someone you like?
I don't think you have any intention of dating yet
What do you mean the guy has no interest in dating?
No, I don't want to date yet
Why? Because I'm studying right now.
Yeah, I don't have any free time
Oh, I see. ㅜㅜ But at least date once when you're young!
Everyone around me said the same thing
So I decided to give it a try
Kiki: So are you single now?
Well, of course not Mosul
So when was your last relationship?
It seems like a very long time ago
You said you have two dogs?
Yeah, one is a Maltese and the other is a Dachshund.
Wow, what color is the dachshund's fur?
Our dog's fur is black
Kiki looks so cute
But do dachshunds shed a lot of hair?
I'm stuck because I'm so into it
I thought it wouldn't fall off, but they say it falls off a lot!
That's right, if you look at the floor, it's a hairy paradise
Kiki is awesome. Maltese doesn't fall off as much as you might think, right?
Too innocent and too gentle
What are Kiki's babies' names?
Maltese is a dog and dachshund is a puppy.
Wow, these names suit everyone so well!
I named the kids
Oh, you have so much sense!
Why did you build it like that?
I wanted to do it by hand, so I looked at the fur color and made it.
Are you exercising these days?
What kind of exercise do you do?
No, I don't exercise, so the hospital told me to exercise.
Kiki, have you been to the hospital recently?
Yeah, I went because I had indigestion, but they told me to exercise.
Kiki, I also have trouble digesting food these days. I guess I need to exercise.
I think exercise is essential
And digestion is also greatly influenced by genetics.
Yeah but I'm the only one who can't digest it
Kiki, your mother does housework and your father runs around for work!
Oh, I see. I'm the only one who doesn't exercise.
Kiki, you should exercise,
Home training not working?
I stay at home
Kiki, so it's your stomach that's the problem!
Yeah, I need to exercise a bit, but I just say it
Kiki: Okay, let's exercise together this time!
Okay, okay, let's do it for real this time.
Do you like playing games?
No I can't play any games
Hey Kiki, you didn't have any games you played when you were young?
I played MapleStory following my younger sibling.
Kiki, how long have you been playing Maple Story?
I did it for a little while when I was in elementary school
There are archers and wizards, right?
Yeah, I guess I've always been a wizard
Kiki Ni's younger brother, when I saw him, he seemed like a striker!
Oh right, I was always fighting
Oh right, warrior Kiki
What level were you?
I only did it until I was in my 70s
So you weren't very good at computer games?
Yeah I don't like the game itself
I see. Then what is the joy of your life?
I'm estj and I just make plans
Have you gone out with your friends recently?
Yeah, I went to Nonsan and played with my sisters.
Nonsan? Is there anything to do in Nonsan?
There were many persimmon trees in every house, and they were pretty.
Kiki Yeah, we have a big persimmon tree at our house too~
There were a lot of persimmons on the persimmon tree.
That's right, now is the season to eat persimmons.
Haven't you tried it?
I didn't eat it this time
But I really want to eat it
Kiki, the persimmons at our house are really delicious~
It must be full of orange and plump and delicious.
Kiki, that's right ㅜㅜ What did you do and play in Nonsan?
I ate with my sisters and went to a cafe.
Did you go to that famous cafe in Nonsan?
I think so
But I can't remember the name
Isn't that the place by any chance called Topjeong Reservoir?
Oh right, it was really pretty
How was the weather in Jeonju today?
It rained all day in Jeonju today.
Kiki Oh my gosh, I only came here briefly in the morning!
My pants are soaking wet like I washed them
Wow ㅜㅜ Are you saying that many people came to Jeonju?
Yeah, there's still a lot to come
Oh my gosh Kiki, I see Zeus crying so hard over there!
Please go somewhere else and cry
Kiki It's a little chilly here now!
The daily temperature range has been really extreme these days.
Kiki, are you wearing a coat these days?
I'm lazy so I wear long sleeves
Kiki, me too, but these days, even long sleeves don't work
If you wear long sleeves, it's hot and cold and it's a mess
Kiki, you're right, I should buy you a coat!
There are a lot of pretty clothes out these days.
I guess we're really going to have a With Corona now!
I wish I could do it quickly
Have you had both doses of the vaccine?
No, I've only had the first one
I haven't been hit yet hehehe
If you get hit once, you won't be able to move your arm.
Oh really? What should I do? I'm scared!
But other than my arm hurting, it doesn't hurt at all
Kiki Really? Then I should be right too.
I hope we can have a meeting of 8 soon!
So every time I meet my friends, I worry about who to leave out.
Oh, and then you break up with your friend!
So I made the appointment twice
Kiki right me too
But when Corona comes, what will be the first thing you do?
I want to gather my friends and have a birthday party
Me too Kiki I'm going to take a picture with the kids!
Oh, is taking pictures a good idea?
Wow, China launched its first satellite to the sun!
Oh really, why did you do that?
Hey guys, they're going to shoot that thing and bring back solar energy!
What's good about bringing solar energy?
There's a power shortage here right now, so it's a headache!
Why is there a power shortage in China?
They say the electricity is out there because they're running low on coal!
Is China so poor that it has no electricity?
They used to bring coal from Australia, but they can't bring it in because of diplomatic issues!
Then, Chinese people will have a very inconvenient life.
Right Kiki, so that's why they shot this satellite this time.
If we launch this satellite, we won't have to worry about electricity.
That's right, that was a success, so now we're going to bring in solar energy and use up a lot of electricity!
I guess that's true
Our country doesn't shoot?
Kiki, I guess our country still has a long way to go,
I think our country shot it too, didn't they?
Have you ever dyed your hair?
I bleached my hair as soon as I turned 20.
Kiki, what color did you bleach your hair?
I don't think there's a color I haven't tried
Oh really? Then you tried pink too?
Of course I dyed my hair myself with Misangshen
Wow, daebak. Self-dyeing doesn't stain easily?
So I bought a lot of hair dye and used it
If I use Kiki's hair dye, won't it stain?
I don't know, but I feel calm and peaceful
Kiki, how long was your hair back then?
I think it's about waist-length?
Wow, then you must have used at least 5 bottles of hair dye!
No, I only did the inside with a secret two-tone
So how many hair dyes did you buy and use?
I think I used two or three
Are you taking any medication these days?
I'm taking an anti-inflammatory medicine
Wow, you really have a bad digestive system?
That's right, my stomach can't digest it
Wow, isn't that a medicine I have to take for the rest of my life?
No, you don't have to eat it as long as the inflammation goes away.
Have you eaten anything bad recently?
No, I have severe sleep apnea, so I eat and then go to sleep right away.
Oh, so that's why you had acid reflux?
I think so
I got scolded by the doctor
Then from now on, you can just sit down and sleep~
So I'm sitting down and sleeping these days
Kiki, don't eat too much, eat moderately!
I tried that too and I lost weight.
Oh my gosh ㅜㅜ Are you the type of person who loses weight easily?
Lose weight and gain weight easily
Do you know an app called Ideas?
No, I don't know, what is that?
Oh really? This is an app where writers create and sell their works!
I think I heard it from a friend
But to call it a work of art, it sells food and accessories like earrings!
I think it would be good to do this as a side job?
Kiki: Um, do you have the skills to make something like that?
He takes after his mother and is good with his hands.
Oh Kiki, then what can you make?
I'm very interested in making necklaces and earrings.
Oh Kiki, then buy the ingredients and make it and post it!
If you want to buy ingredients, you have to go to Dongdaemun.
I guess I don't have to go all the way to Dongdaemun?
Oh really? I heard Dongdaemun is a mecca for ingredients.
Kiki, but isn't it far from Jeonju to Dongdaemun?
That's too far
I guess I'll have to look elsewhere
What music are you listening to these days?
I like calm songs these days
If you want a calm song, which singer's song do you like?
I'm into Juicy music these days
Juicy? Are you a new singer who just came out?
I think so
I don't know much about Juicy, but I like the song
Kiki, is that guy a male singer?
Wow man, your voice is so nice
Kiki Oh really? What's the title?
I should listen to it on YouTube!
The title is Thinking of You
Oh Kiki, the song title also has some kind of feel to it~?
Oh right, listen to this while you sleep
I sleep while listening to Howl's Moving Castle OST.
That song is really a hit
Of course it's my 18th song?
Japanese Ghibli movies are super fun
What movies have you seen recently?
I don't watch movies much these days.
Kiki, really? You can't watch it because you're studying?
I'm scared to go to the cinema because of corona
Then you don't even watch Netflix?
I watch dramas and animations on Netflix.
If it's animation, maybe a demon reaper?
Oh, I haven't seen anything like that... I'm a nerd
Oh, if it's a Netflix anime, it's obviously a demon anime, right?
I didn't watch it because the kids only talked about the ear knife
Oh really? You really have to see that. It's a masterpiece!
I'm saving it to watch it all at once
Kiki, a new season is coming out this month!
New season? What's coming out?
It's called the brothel version and it's a 19+ deal set in a Japanese red-light district!
Wow, I have to watch this 19+
What are you having for dinner tonight, honey?
I ate Shinsang today Kiki
body?
What, really? Fire Chicken Rosé?
no
I heard there was cream in the rice cake, so I tried it.
Oh, are you talking about that cream yop-tteok?
that's right
That truffle spicy is the spiciest, but it's not spicy at all
When you say truffle, do you mean oil?
Yeah, some places give it separately, but we mix it up
Kiki, doesn't that smell good?
Yeah and this is really delicious
Kiki, are you telling me to just shut up and eat? Kiki
that's right
And these days there's no broccoli in the cream, but there used to be broccoli?!
Wow, I also like tteokbokki with bcohol in it!
It's been a while since I've seen it in real cream and it's good
Kiki oh my gosh
I first tried it at Ashley's and fell in love with it!
I used to go to the pasta restaurant Kiki on Ogeori every day.
What's good about living alone, oppa?
If you live alone, you won't be interfered with by your parents.
Kiki, is that a monthly rent or a deposit?
I'm currently living in a rented house Kiki
Daejeon definitely seems to have cheaper rooms than Seoul!
that's right
It seems like monthly rent and deposit are cheap for a metropolitan city
Yeah Kiki
I was able to get a 1.5 room apartment in Daejeon for the monthly rent of the house I live in.
This is awesome
Then just come down to Daejeon
Kiki: Then, does that mean the company has to come down to Daejeon too?
Hey, you'll be out soon~
Wasn't quitting your job a dream?
Kiki right
But I'm unemployed, how can I go to Daejeon?
Well, I'm a beggar who works in Daejeon and has settled down.
Indeed, I wonder if there is a job in Daejeon that I can work at!
Then there are a lot of things to do in Daejeon too ㅠ
ㅠ Is there a position available at your company?
Come and do my bidding Kiki
Oppa, how many hours does it take you to commute to and from work?
It varies depending on the site, but most of the time it doesn't take more than an hour.
The sites are mostly in the Daejeon area, right?
Yeah, I'm in Daejeon and sometimes I go to the neighboring areas too.
I see
Don't you get stuck in traffic when you commute to work?
I went out at dawn and there was no car Kiki
Kiki dog funny kiki
Brother, all your friends drive 10-ton trucks?
Oh right
Kiki says only local people go there
Kiki: Then I'll drive a really sturdy car!
I just use it for commuting, so I don't necessarily ride something sturdy.
But aren't there a lot of things like nails scattered around the site?
Then you should get sturdy tires Kiki
I bought Kiki tires for mountaineering~
Okay~
But that costs a lot of money~
Kiki, I admit that
Tires are too expensive
You're in the countryside too, so I think you should get a mountain bike Kiki
Oppa, how many years have you been working at your current company?
I've been doing this for about 3 years now.
Oh, you worked longer than I thought?
Do you like it?
I don't like anything, but they just give me a lot of money, Kiki
Kiki, how much do you earn a month?
Kiki, I'm currently receiving an average of 5 million won a month
Wow, awesome Kiki
Where do you spend all that money?
I need to save everything and invest it for my future later Kiki
Then you can invest in me~
If I invest in you, will it grow a little? Kiki
Kiki: Well, you won't get into debt!
don't worry!
It looks to me like it's all going to fly away Kiki
It's not Kiki
I'm going to start a business soon~
I'll call you~
Oh, so that's what you're asking me to borrow, Kiki.
What percentage is the interest?
No, you want me to invest~ in me~
There is no interest~
Then I'll just leave it in the bank and get interest Kiki
Brother, the soldier who died from overwork 37 years ago was eventually found to have died from beatings within the group!
Wow, then aren't those people murderers?
that's right,
He told me after 37 years,
Who suddenly said that?
So what happened to those people?
The colleagues who were there at the time are now saying,
Well, the military said they didn't investigate because they didn't have the right to prosecute.
Those people's personal information wasn't revealed?
What's there to reveal about my identity? After 37 years, the perpetrator would have died.
No
Since I was 20, I must be around 60
No, the victim was only 20 years old and the perpetrator would have been in his 30s or 40s!
Oh, so you're saying the perpetrator was a career soldier?
Oh, right!
Do you know why he beat you?
Why do they say he beat me?
This victim was limping and I didn't like that!
Oh, then if you don't like the way I look at you, you should hit me Kiki
Oppa, what kind of academy did you go to when you were a student?
I just went to a secret school Kiki
Is Kiki's Math Academy a place to study math?
No, but they do Korean, math, social studies, but aren't they calling it a secret academy?
Yeah, I think back then we all called it a secret school.
Why did you do that?
I don't know Kiki
Why is it so funny when I say it's a secret school now? Kiki
Kiki, that's right Kiki
It was common back then, but it's a bit unfamiliar now Kiki
But I liked the workbooks more than the academy!
Ah, as expected
I like study materials too
Where have you been, oppa?
My sister is Kumon, I am at eye level My sister is Mr. Yoon Kiki
Why did you two study different subjects?
I don't know
Kiki, your mom was always like that because she was hooked on the board
Kiki, do you remember how much the study materials cost per month back then?
Well, I don't know
Should I do this for 50 thousand won?
But wouldn't the labor cost have been higher since the teacher came to visit?
If you look at it that way, Mr. Yoon talks to me in English every morning. Kiki
Where are your parents now?
Are your parents out right now?
Where did you go?
Kiki, do your parents also live in Daejeon?
Kiki is right
I live in Daejeon, but I can't live with him because I live separately.
Kiki, do you talk to your parents often?
It's not like the Kiki family always says that no news is good news~
Kiki, I admit that
Kiki, you need to keep some distance
When my parents call, they know something is wrong and startle me.
Kiki, really?
But my mom gets upset if I don't contact her!?
Oh, I know that, but I get annoyed if I do it too often Kiki
I admit that Kiki
Are your parents sick?
Yeah, you're still young and healthy, Kiki.
But, please make sure to take your brother for a health checkup!
I'm worried that my dad won't go because he finds it annoying ㅠㅠ
Kiki noㅜㅜ
The government provides health checkups, so make sure to go and get them done!
I have to do that to get compensation later ㅠㅠ
I have to send it by force!
Oppa, don't you want to date?
I really want to do it, but I can't get an introduction
Kiki oppa, you like Jamanchu, right? Jamanchu~
I'm always busy working, washing up at home, and sleeping ㅠㅠ
Kiki my boyfriend is so busy right now too ㅜㅜ
It's not easy to meet people in today's busy society ㅠㅠ
that's right,
My boyfriend said he'd come to my house after working night shift, but I wonder when he'll come.
Sigh, I heard it's not good to be lonely
Kiki break up
It's not Kiki~
I like being alone~
Then just tell him not to come today and rest at home~
no
The car home is broken so I'm coming to your house Kiki
Oh, so you're coming to my house because you need a house?
Oh right
I even promised to buy you something delicious tomorrow!
What's that guy?
Bring me here, I'll give you a beating Kiki
Kiki oh good good~
Oppa, give me a scolding~
Kiki, if I do that, I might get scolded by my brother~
Hey, when are you going to bring that puppy home?
cat?
I'm talking to a friend right now, and I'll prepare it soon and bring it over.
really?
How many months old is that puppy?
I think it's been about 3 months Kiki
Oh, then I'll be eating baby food!
Do cats also eat baby food?
Yeah! Maybe I should feed him wet food?
Oh, are you talking about the one that's soaked in water?
Oh, right!
Kids are crazy about that~
What do you need to raise a cat?
First of all, feathers and a long coat are a must!
If you sprinkle some kind of powder on it, it makes you feel like you're on drugs. What is that?
Oh, I know that~
That's why it's called catnip~
Yeah, I'm going to buy one and give it to Kiki
Kiki, but you should spray it when you're an adult, not when you're a child!
Wow, I think I sprayed it on my friend's cat when it was a kitten. Shivering...
Have you ever seen your brother play volleyball?
I saw Kiki at the Olympics this time
Did you see Kim Eun-kyung play this time?
Yeah, as expected, Toast Sister is cool
Yeah ㅜㅜ
But Brazil was so strong!
But it's worth saying that Kiki
Ah Kiki Black Sister Black Sister Kiki
It came out wrong, Kiki
Kiki dog laugh
But it's worth saying that, Kiki
Oh my Kiki, I burst out laughing just hearing this now Kiki
Kiki, I also thought for a moment, huh? Kiki
But even though they were the opposing team, they were so good that I had to admit it Kiki
Yeah Kiki
That player and Gabi are really good!
that's right
It's okay though, because we fought hard~
Yeah ㅜㅜ
I hope Kim Eun-kyung appears on TV entertainment shows more often!
Sister Ssukbang, now you're a celebrity like Seo Jang-hoon hyung~
Did you play tag a lot when you were little?
of course
I think that tape was the best Kiki
Kiki, did your brother use up all the tape in the school toolbox?
No Nop
We have tapes at home that my father kept!
Kiki okki okki~
Hey, do you know the game Huh?
Are you sure what you're talking about isn't some kind of game?
What are the rules of the puck game that my brother is talking about?
Kiki, blowing on that round flat piece of paper with your mouth and turning it over
Oh, right,
Isn't that a game?
I don't know Kiki
I think that's called something, but what is it called?
Kiki puck? Huh? What the heck, is it Kiki puck?
Pour- this is it, pour-
Kiki is making noise with her mouth right now
Ah, I really burst out laughing ㅋㅁ Kiki
I'm really good at that!
Oh, you seem to be a bit of a pro too. I'm also really good.
Kiki, if you put 10 of those on top of each other, you can knock them all over in one go!
Oh, can you turn over all ten of those at once?
That's luck
Where did you go on a trip with your friends recently?
I can't say it was recently, but I went to Daecheon a long time ago.
Daecheon?
These days, grilled clams are delicious!
I want to go to Daecheon!
That's why I want to go to the beach too ㅠㅠ
ㅜㅜ Me too ㅜㅜ
But the East Sea is the best!
Then I have to go to Gangwon-do ㅠㅠ It's too far there
Is the only place near Daejeon that has the East Sea other than Gangwon-do? ㅜㅜ
But oppa, you used to sell corn in Gangwon-do, right?
Is the Hal Kiki Corn story true?
How did you sell it?
I bought some corn and sold it on the street Kiki
Kiki, how much did you buy the corn for and how much did you sell it for on the street?
Buy it for 1 and sell it for 5 and stuff~ Kiki
Kiki, huh? Did people buy a lot of corn?
I think I earned enough to just live, Kiki
Kiki when did you do that
If it's corn, it must be summer!
I quit my job and have some free time so I can make some pocket money by doing Kiki.
Oppa, you rest when it rains, right?
What are you doing?
When it rains and I rest, I can't go anywhere and just lie down Kiki
Oppa, then your days off are rainy days?
Or at a friend's wedding or a Kiki event?
Then when on earth do you clean?
So I want you to come and clean it up!
It's not Kiki
I also don't feel like going out when it rains.
Come and clean when I'm not there during the day and invite your friends over to play.
Kiki Oh, good!
Oppa, do you like rainy days or sunny days when you can work?
Ah I don't like either of them, but I think a comfortable rainy day would be nice Kiki
Kiki: Then how do you get your salary?
What about days when it rains a lot?
That's why I can't make much money during the rainy season ㅠㅠ
Then what do you do then?
I guess I should use what I've already earned, Kiki
So that's why your brother saves so much?
Kiki, you can only save freely
It's not regular
A man in his 40s who threatened a woman for ignoring his advances was sentenced to five years in prison.
So there was only threats and no murder or violence?
No, he threatened to kill your sister and sexually assaulted the woman he was courting.
Wow, this is really evil, but only 5 years?
Are you the son of a conglomerate?
therefore,
I don't know about that, but he threatened to beat up my sister!
In our country, if the crime is heinous, I wish they would beat the criminal a little harder.
We say that the heaviest punishment is for murder!
I honestly wish the death penalty would be revived in our country too.
that's right,
Or just sentence them to hundreds of years like in the US!
Yeah, I think it's better to live until you die, then take it easy and more crimes will happen ㅠㅠ
But what makes me mad is that prisons are also run with our taxes!
It's a shame to waste it on them!
If I were to stay there for the rest of my life, I would pay a guard fee, but for only 5 years?
Kiki is right,
Or maybe it would be nice to lock up about 40 people in an iron cage like in Thailand!
That's right, if you get caught in North Korea, they say it's not a place where people can stay. Kiki
Kiki, doesn't North Korea shoot people whenever they get the chance?
I think that's something our country can learn a little bit from!
The UK has announced that the coronavirus is likely to have formed naturally!
What does it mean that it was formed in a natural state?
It is highly likely that the coronavirus originated from bat cells!
Oh, so does that mean the host is a bat?
that's right
The coronavirus has been around for a long time, but somehow it spread to humans!
So you're saying that it originally existed in bats, but then changed and was passed on to humans?
that's right!
Originally, corona was not easily transmitted to humans, but the current issue, the coronavirus, has cells that are formed in a way that makes it easy to transmit to humans!
Oh, so then how should we live now...
What, now there's a system called With Corona!
But even if you get it together like a cold, won't your insides get ruined anyway if you catch it?
Yeah ㅜㅜ
The reason why Corona is scary is because there is a high possibility of aftereffects!
They say that more than that, the organs are all damaged ㅠㅠ
That too, but the probability of developing aftereffects is over 50%!
I don't care about Corona, but I don't like my body getting ruined.
But if your body doesn't break down, isn't it almost like death?
I just don't want to get caught ㅠㅠ
I hate it so much
Oppa, what gift have you ever given to a girl?
I bought my girlfriend AirPods Kiki
Wow, is this true? Aren't AirPods expensive?
When I bought it back then, it was over 300,000 won Kiki
Wow, awesome. Do you like that person?
No, the dog is always biting me
Tearsㅜㅜ Oppa, don't rip me offㅜㅜ Oppa, I should be the only one who can rip you off!
But there's something about dogs that I can't handle, Kiki
Kiki dirt ㅜㅜ Then have you ever bought cosmetics for your girlfriend?
Ah, I didn't buy you cosmetics. My sister gave me some packs that she received from a company she worked for.
Oh really? Where is the company pack?
Oh, what is it they say there? I don't know because it's in English. Kiki
Kiki, how many packs have you given?
Oh, the pack I gave you isn't like that. It's the kind you apply on your face!
Oh really? Is that gold in there?
No, I don't think there's any gold, but it's really good, Kiki
Does your brother get mouth ulcers easily?
Yeah, I really get sick a lot ㅠㅠ
Oh my gosh ㅜㅜ Then you have to take vitamins, oppa!
If I get colds often, is it because I have a vitamin deficiency?
This has to do with vitality!
Oh really?
Have you heard of Yalbochil?
Kiki Al, Bochil,? Oppa, use that,?
Yeah... Honestly, other ointments hurt even if you apply them
But you only have to endure that once
That's true, but doesn't that require a lot of courage?
Yeah, so just close your eyes and apply it lightly Kiki
Kiki, that would make you cry again, right?
My high school teacher used to put on a mask when I was sick, and he was happy to see me suffer.
Looks like revenge
Kiki, you teased that teacher a lot, didn't you?
no
He was my favorite teacher ㅠㅠ
Are you sure?
Oh, it wasn't like you liked me unilaterally?
He even gave me chocolate when I graduated ㅡㅡ
Brother, have you not bought the porridge yet?
Yeah, I'm annoyed
You order it and I'll send you the money.
Oh, I'm going to buy it!
Let's do some tools~
Women are always working hard Kiki
Then you can get a discount on free shipping too~
I don't know what to do with that annoying thing Kiki
Even doing this with my brother right now is like working together~
The kid I used to know would always do whatever he did. Kiki
Kiki, I also had someone I worked with, so it was pretty fun~
That's why he can't save money Kiki
Buy every day
Kiki It's okay though because I bought it cheaply~
What have you done with tools?
Me? It was probably a fan then, right?
I got something from him, do you know what it is?
Kiki, are you the person who bought the AirPods for me?
that's right
A bag to organize your tools? Kiki, you did that.
Hey, what are you watching on TV these days?
I saw Las Vegas today and it was hilarious Kiki
Las? Who's here today?
It wasn't today, it was Jaebang, Jo Hye-ryun, Shin Bong-sun, Kim Min-kyung, Oh Nami, and Kiki appeared
Wow, it's been a long time, Ms. Jo Hye-ryeon!
Dog tolerance is for women?
I think that came out on a variety show, Kiki
Oh really?
Did you know that Mrs. Jo Hye-ryeon used to box?
Yeah, I came out to Las Vegas today and boxing was mentioned.
Kiki, really?
You made the other person's nose bleed that time!
But he said that he would lose if he fought Lee Si-young.
Kiki Ah, Lee Si-young is really amazing!
Kiki's arms are longer than hers, so she can't reach them.
Kiki Lee Si-young runs 20 kilometers every morning!
Kiki, she seems to be living a really cool life.
Right, Oppa, did you see Lee Si-young's body in Sweet Home?
Oh, Lee Si-young's body is showing?
Then I guess I'll have to look at it again, Kiki
Oppa, do you really like action movies?
right
I guess I enjoy watching Kiki
So, did you see the sinkhole this time, oppa?
Isn't that too hard to see as action, Kiki?
Action, disaster, comedy, it's all there~
I think it's a comedy Kiki
Kiki, really?
So what have you seen recently?
Lately I haven't been watching movies, but I've been watching Kiki on Netflix.
Aren't there a lot of Paper House series?
Yes, I've watched up to season 1 episode 10 of Kiki.
I have to drive straight
Hop Kiki, what's the plot?
I just introduced the characters and we're in the process of taking over the mint and negotiating with the hostages.
So are all kids thieves?
Yeah, that's what it was, but the smart head planned it for years to make it look like a hero.
Kiki, really?
Are you executing that plan now?
Yeah, so the negotiating leader is getting cursed at by people Kiki
Sister, is there any food you don't like?
Yeah, there is
Not much
Very much
Wow, are you a picky eater often?
Yeah, I'm a total picky eater
Wow~ Sister, what aren't you eating?
Beans, kimchi, bracken, bean sprouts
Then I will just stay by my sister's side~
Okay, then you can eat it all.
Kiki Of course
These are all things I like!
Oh really, you're not a picky eater?
I'm only picky about one thing!
Oh really, what a thing!
I wonder what it is
I don't even put mushrooms in my mouth!
Oh, why are mushrooms so delicious?
Kiki I really hate squishy mushrooms!
Oh, you really hate soft things?
You said you live with your sister's parents, right?
no
I'm living alone
Oh, how many years have you been living alone?
Oh seriously I'm in my 5th year haha
Wow, at what age did you become independent, sister?
I started living alone when I was 23 ㅠㅠ
stylish
Did you come out because of the company?
no
Because of trouble with my dad
Wow, did you fight with your parents often?
Yeah, that's why I left home.
Yeah, it's better to keep some distance!
Yeah, that's why I said I'll be home late
Kiki I just get scolded and ignored when that happens!
Oh, I really want to hang out comfortably with my friends.
Kiki, so you like it when I come out?
how is it?
Yeah, there are good and bad points.
Sister, you said you had your own car!
Yeah, right
I love cars so much
I see
When did you say you bought it?
I bought it last year
It hasn't been that long
Did you give your car a nickname too?
Oh, I'm still thinking about it
What should I do?
I named myself *karo after the last syllable of my name
How about you do that too, sister?
Then I guess I should call it a ttukki
Kiki, where are you?
It's cuter than I thought?
Yeah my car is cute too haha I guess I'll go with that
that's right
What color is the tea?
Um my car is white
Pretty
After all, white is the truth when it comes to cars!
White is the best color for tea, after all
Kiki, I see
Sister, what model car do you drive?
I have a new Avante
Haha okay
How are your relationships with people at work, sister?
Yeah, we're on good terms
Mood maker
Is Kiki the mood maker at work?
Yeah because I'm the youngest haha
I see
As expected from the youngest~
I'm the youngest too~
The youngest has a hard time living in society
Kiki admits,
But I had a bad day today,
Admit it, admit it
Why what happened?
No, our team members went to another place.
Oh really
I see
It must have been hard
Oh right,
It's hard because the people who are left have to do what the people who left did!
Oh, I really have to do all the work
ㅜㅜ That's right
I almost couldn't get off work today,
Whew, I've had that happen to me a lot too
ㅜㅜ Does this happen to you often too, unnie?
Yeah, because of people who suddenly quit their jobs
Sister, have you ever dated a career soldier?
Yeah, I dated someone once
Oh really?
How was it?
Was it good?
Yeah but it's too tight
Kiki, right? Aren't the soldiers really busy?
Yeah, he's a busy soldier, so he's not cute
Aah Kiki
But that's also Kebakkeim!
I like people who are cute ㅠㅠ
Kiki the Soldier is also a very cute person!
Can you find me a cute person among the soldiers?
Kiki but everyone already has a girlfriend~
Please find it
Everyone must have a woman
But in the end, the military brothers were too busy to do anything
Soldiers have a hard time
It really looks different
Kiki is right,
And I always date at home and I like Chime Kiki
Oh, it's really unfortunate, but still, the right person should meet.
Sister, is there anything you want to study right now?
I hate studying the most ㅠㅠ
Kiki: But you don't have any qualifications or any sports?
I want to become a certified esthetician
Ah, a beautician!
Is that a national qualification?
Yeah, that's right
I want to study, but I'm not smart enough
Kiki: But since that's mostly practice-based, wouldn't it be doable?
Yeah, I'm thinking about giving it a try
Yeah, my friend is doing that too and he says it's more fun than he thought!
Oh, I'm so jealous
Should I try it quickly too?
Kiki, but I heard that there's no place to learn in Nonsan!
Ah, there really isn't anything to learn in Nonsan.
Kiki, at least you have to go to Daejeon and do it ㅜㅜ
Ah, I have to go all the way to Daejeon ㅠㅠ
Oh right
Sister, you can go because you have your own car!
I'll have to try it later
What does your sister's father do these days?
My father is self-employed
If you are self-employed, what field are you in?
I'm running a grocery store
Oh, you run a restaurant?
Yeah I'm having a restaurant with my mom haha
Sister, then will you go out and help me out on the weekend?
no
Open a samgyetang restaurant
I like chicken
Wow, Samgyetang, isn't it a hit in the summer?
Um, right
I'm so sick of samgyetang
Kiki I really like Samgyetang!
I like chicken better
Kiki Chicken?
Samgyetang is more nutritious and better!
I'm going to open a chicken restaurant later.
Kiki, where are you planning to start your own brand?
I'm going to prepare Kyochon Chicken
Sister, are you thinking of having children?
I want to have a child soon
Oh really?
How many children do you want to have?
I really want to have a daughter and a son
Son is first and daughter is second? Like this?
Yeah, first son, second daughter
But that order is really the ideal order!
Yeah, that's right
Still my daughter is the best
Kiki I want a daughter too
We have to go to the bathhouse together!
Yeah, that's right
My mom wants to have a daughter like me
Kiki, huh? But that's what my mom said too~
Yeah right Kiki
My grandmother said the same thing
Kiki wow lol Kiki
So, are all the children born the same?
Yeah, I guess everyone feels the same way
What would Kiki do if she had a daughter like her?
it's hard
I need to raise him well
What was your sister's puppy's name?
Oh, my dog's name is Autumn
Is Autumn eating well these days?
Yeah, I ate well
I love fall so much
Kiki, has Autumn ever fed you homemade snacks?
Yeah, feed it to me and I'll make it for you
Oh my gosh
Does your sister have a dryer at home?
Dried and dried pollack
Then eat well
Kids really like dried pollack!
Yeah, that's right, it's good for your health
Kiki is right
What do you feed your baby?
Buy the best feed
Is your sister buying it from the animal hospital?
Yeah, I'm sorry
I don't remember the name Dust
Yes, they have all the materials on display there in English!
Right ㅠㅠ
The price is around 50,000 won.
Sister, do you have a favorite sport these days?
I like golf these days
Wow, can you go out to the field too, unnie?
Yeah, getting ready to go out to the field
Wow, awesome
That's what they call lifting your head!
Yes, I want to go get my hair done with dad
Kiki, are you going with your dad?
I want to go with dad
Then give me the money
Kiki's dad must have a lot of nice golf clubs!
Kiki's dad's golf clubs are used
I also have used
Kiki: But aren't golf clubs quite expensive?
Yeah, it's expensive but good
But I'm in a second-hand country
Kiki it's okay
Oh, then how much does your sister's golf club cost?
Ah, about 200,000 won on Junggonara
Come and see
Even if it's used, it's worth around 200,000 won!
that's right
200,000 won for the full set
Sister, have you ever played a lottery game?
Yeah I like it
I did it when I was young
Was the price 100 won when you were younger?
Yeah, that's right
It was a hundred won haha
Kiki, what did you get out of that?
I had fun with the eraser and the sticker
Eraser? Sticker?
Did something like that come out?
Yeah, it's a hit or miss situation, so that's what happens
Ahh Kiki, you're awesome
I did this and got first place!
Oh really I never ㅠㅠ
Kiki, I got first place and even got a condolence gift!
I'm really jealous, you even gave me a condolence message
I don't have any
I bought some delicious food with Kiki's condolences!
Oh, that would be really nice
I'm unlucky, I'm unlucky
Kiki, I bought it with the money I was going to buy for notebooks back then!
Still, I liked the eraser too
Have you ever fought while traveling with a friend?
I really never have
I fought once!
He's so cool!
Oh seriously, why did we fight? ㅠㅠ
badly?
Oh! I made all the plans, but you're saying you're tired and going to sleep!
Oh, it's too much if you're really tired
Kiki, that's right
But when you travel, you have to go even if you're tired, right!?
Oh, I'm really mad, really
Kiki admits
That's why I came out alone!
Oh, we really need to travel together
So,
I ate rice by myself too,
Wow, that's really too much
Kiki, I can't help it
So I'm never traveling with him again!
Still, it's great that you can eat alone and eat Kikki Ke
Kiki, I can't help it
I have to eat to live too!
I really need to go and travel alone next time.
Sister, what season do you like the most?
I really like the weather these days.
Sister, do you like fall weather the best?
I like the time between fall and winter the best
Oh, I admit it too
I really like this kind of weather too!
It's really cool, I like it, it's not hot
Kiki is right
But didn't it rain today?
Yeah, it rained
It's a bit chilly
right?
I heard it rained in Nonsan this morning!
Oh really?
I don't know about that
I haven't seen it
Sister, haven't you seen it raining?
Yeah, I haven't seen it
The floor was wet
Kiki, so it rained or something?
Yeah, I see
I can't see it
Kiki, I see
It was raining when I went to work!
Yeah, always bring an umbrella
Sister, have you ever tried scratching a lottery ticket?
Yeah, I know, I know
I tried it
Sister, what was the highest amount you ever paid?
No income
Always a dud
Kiki Have you ever had a 100,000 won bill?
Wow, really
What did you do with it?
Me? I bought a lottery ticket worth ten thousand won with that!
I don't have that kind of luck either
You are lucky
Kiki, that's right
But this time, I saw an article saying that there was someone who won 2 billion won.
Wow, really
What would you do if you had 2 billion?
Kiki? Of course, wouldn't you buy a house first?
I bought a house, owned a building, and bought a car
Kiki is right
Sister, while we're on the subject, do you want to go buy it this time?
Yeah, let's go together
It's really nice to just think about it
Kiki, come and get ten thousand won from the ATM machine!
Yeah, I don't even have ten thousand won, but you want to give it to me?
Sister, have you ever tried Bitcoin?
Yeah, I know, I know
I've only heard of it
Kiki, me too, sis, do you happen to know about Dogecoin?
I want to try it too
What is Dogecoin?
Have you never heard of Dogecoin, which is like Bitcoin?
Is Dogecoin better than Bitcoin?
Well, it's the same coin, but this coin was a huge issue earlier this year!
Yeah, I don't know much because I only do stocks.
Let me explain further
Kiki: Then, sis, do you happen to know about Tesla?
Yeah, I know
I heard from my dad
Kiki, you know that's a car brand name, right?
Oh, I just found out because my dad told me
Oh, that Tesla CEO invested heavily in Dogecoin!
Wow, he really is a real person
But he invested 1 trillion in Dogecoin and earned 1 trillion more!
Oh really
1 trillion jackpot,
I'm jealous of you 1 trillion
Sister, where do you get your foundation from?
Yeah foundation is IOPE
IOPE?
Do you like it moist there?
Yeah, IOPE is moisturizing, so it's good for dry skin.
Sister, have you tried Dior Pect?
Yeah, both Dior and YSL
But did you switch to IOPE because you liked it the best?
Yeah, that suits me just fine
I see
No, Dior gave me a foundation sample!
Where did you get it from? Originally?
I just use what they sell at Olyoung!
I guess you just have good skin
Olyeongdo is also good
No, it's Kiki
I don't like it
But since Dior gave it to me, I wanted to try it!
I want it too
Please me too
Kiki, you can request a sample of this!
Oh really
I should apply too
Sister, do you like alcohol?
Yeah, I really like it
Eat it every day
Kiki, really?
Sister, how much can you drink?
Two bottles of soju are easy
Kiki one shot
Wow, awesome Kiki
Sister, what kind of soju do you like?
I like Chamisul haha and beer too
Kiki: Most young people like Chamisul, don't they?
that's right
I like Lindo too
Beer is Cass
But if you drink like that, will you feel okay?
If you drink it, you will get a headache and a liverache
Oh, sis, you must try the milk thistle!
I feel so sick
They say milk thistle is good
Kiki is right
For people like my sister, milk thistle is a must!
I should buy one too
I have to eat well
Kiki: Oh, you can buy 60 tablets for 20,000 won!
Oh really
Where can I buy it?
What do you usually buy online, sister?
Yeah, clothes and shoes from Carrot Market
You bought clothes and shoes at Carrot Market?
I bought clothes and shoes at Carrot Market
I see
What have you bought recently?
I recently bought some Nike shoes.
Nike shoes?
There's something that's trendy these days. Should I buy that?
I bought a killer whale for 30 thousand won
What is the original price of Kiki the Killer Whale?
I originally thought it was around 40
Wow, awesome
But is there anyone selling it for 30,000 won?
That's what I'm saying
It's weird
Looks salty Kiki
Kiki, you bought it for 30,000 won!?
I think it's salty
I got hit
Kiki, really?
Are you sure?
Are you sure it's salty?
Still, it's a huge gain for thirty thousand won.
Sister, have you ever actually seen a celebrity?
I saw Shin Min-a on Garosu-gil
Wow, awesome
They say Shin Min-a is like a total mannequin?
Yeah, that's right
The assistant is really pretty
Kiki, really?
What did you see while filming?
No, I was just passing by
I want to look like that too ㅠㅠ
Kiki me too,
But it's already ruined from the start,
I'm already ruined from the weight point of view
Isn't Kiki's weight something to be taken for granted?
I weigh 53 kilos, but I'm not slim.
Kiki Shin Min-a weighs 53 kilograms?
Isn't she 175cm tall? Shin Min-a? Kiki
Kiki no
It shouldn't be 175, but at least 170, right?
You look so tall, you're cool
Kiki, that's because your face is so small that it looks even bigger!
His face was really as big as a fist
Does your sister like watching movies?
Yeah, then I like movie theaters ㅠ
Do you like watching movies at the cinema?
Yeah, I like watching it at the cinema.
Kiki me too,
But you can't go often because of Corona?
Yeah, that's right
Everyone is keeping social distance
that's right,
Sister, when was the last time you went?
Me a month or two ago?
Iksan
Oh my, two months ago?
What did you go see?
I don't even remember what I saw then
At that time, it was summer, so did you happen to see a langzhong?
I fought with my boyfriend so I don't even remember properly haha
Kiki, why did you go all the way there to fight!
Yeah, wherever you go, there's always a fight
Kiki eh,
I really don't remember the movie~
Yeah, I don't even remember
I don't want to go to Iksan Island
I'm having a huge appetite right now!
Why were you under a spell?
It's not me, why are you like this Kiki
A hundred million kiki, is that correct?
Mother Nature has burst into me ㅜ
The pain is ㅠㅠ Take some medicine, it'll go away quickly
I woke up in the middle of the night with a stomachache ㅜ
Oh my, I know that too ㅠㅠ Give me a steaming hot bath ㅠㅠ
Oh my gosh ㅜㅜ I had a really big appetite yesterday!
Women are really accurate, Kiki
Kiki: That's right, that's why I ate a late-night snack yesterday!
I finished last week, what should I have for a midnight snack?
I went to the convenience store with Cremi and Hot Bar and bought some and ate them Kiki
Wow wow it looks delicious I ordered a hotdog yesterday too Kiki
Kiki Oh, did you really order a Myeongryang hotdog!?
Yeah, I have to eat what's left after I go to the gym today.
Kiki Yeah yeah I'm planning on going today!
You know you have to sprinkle sugar on the potatoes with cheese
Does your sister have a microwave at home?
Yeah, I have a microwave because my boyfriend bought it for me haha
I see. You said there was a TV originally, right?
Yeah, there were two there, but I asked them to take one away!
Wow, there were two TVs!?
Yeah, one big one in the room and a wall-mounted Kiki in the living room.
Wow, that's awesome. So, Kiki, you went with the full option?
Yes, it's a full option, but it's a bit ambiguous. Kiki's home appliances are decorated
Oh really? What was included as a default option?
Just a refrigerator, a washing machine, and a TV.
Hey, why don't you give me a refrigerator, washing machine, microwave, and TV?
Oh, so you're buying a MacBook? Kiki
Kiki, I'm going to watch Netflix on my MacBook!
Netflix is so great. I want to buy a MacBook too.
This is all debt, debt~
Yeah? But you still have to invest in yourself.
Sister, when you buy a car, do you anticipate the maintenance costs?
Yeah, I asked my momㅜㅜ It's a bit expensive though
Oh, your mom drives a car too?
Yeah, Mom and Dad, take them both!
Wow, then your sister must have more than two cars?
Yeah, that's why sometimes I make my dad drink instead.
Hey Kiki, your dad is awesome!
So what kind of car do your parents drive?
Both of them are SUVs so they look good
Wow, I guess the car has to be big, right?
Yeah, yeah, it was scary when I rode something like the Morning...
Wow, did you see that big bus crushed inside the morning bus?
Yeah, it's really scary when I see things like thatㅜㅜ
Right ㅜㅜ So you're watching K-Pop?
Yeah that's right I should drive a cheap car too haha
Kiki: No, that's a cheap car. As expected, you're a bourgeois!
Stop talking about cars, I want to buy a car soon!
Are you thinking of quitting your job now, sister?
Yeah, after the Youth Tomorrow Filling is over, I'll quit my job.
Okay, so it's going to be an 8 month countdown?
Yeah that's right I even made a D-Day post on KakaoTalk haha
Wow, Kiki's bosses at work also know what D-Day means?
No, I don't know, even if you say Kiki, the manager probably noticed
Aaah Kiki, but why are you quitting? Is work hard?
No, that's not it. I'm just so tired of human relationships.
Is that because there are a lot of regular customers there? ㅜㅜ
Hey, then I quit already. The employees are tired.
What happened with the staff?
Yeah, I keep bumping into one person, it's hardㅜㅜ
Ha, but I think it's really hard in any job if you don't get along with the people you work with.
That's right, if things are hard, what can I do? ㅠㅠ Even that should be good
Yeah, I know because I've been there too.
How did you solve it? I'm jealousㅜㅜ I'm going to give up
Sister, have you ever used PX products?
Yeah, what's the name of that green cosmetic?
Oh, I know, you're talking about Dr. G products, right?
I tried Dr. G and Dr. G snail cream
Yeah Kiki, that's really popular. They sell it at All Young too, right?
That's really cheap and moist, I love it~ Yeah
Yeah, everyone I know uses that moisturizing cream!
But it's much cheaper to live in PX than in Olyeong.
That's right, I saw that it's over 20,000 won at Ollyong, but PX is less than 10,000 won!
So, since Yeonmu-dae is my hometown, I sometimes go to the military mart and buy things!
Kiki Oh, Daebak, can you go to the Military Mart too?
My grandfather was a soldier, so if you have a certificate, you can goㅜㅜ
Wow, awesome, sis. Then can I ask for AHC eye cream?
Great, if you go there you can buy ramen and food really cheaply Kiki
Kiki, I'm so jealous. I have to go with you later!
The ice cream is cheap and the pack is super cheap too. I especially recommend the pack!
Sister, you have three siblings, right?
Yeah I'm one of three siblingsㅠㅠ I'm the oldest
Who do you think is studying the best?
Kiki, I think my younger brother is the best
Really? My little sister must have studied quite a bit for dental school too!?
No, Kiki's younger brother is the only one who majored in humanities. Kiki
Wow Kiki, I see. Then your little brother must have had a free time. ㅜ
Yeah, that's right, and that's why the dog went down to college. It matched the grades.
ㅜㅜOh my gosh ㅜㅜ I guess I’m not taking the CSAT this time?
I see, but these days I'm too busy working out to study.
Oh Kiki, that's right, being healthy is better than studying!
But I really only worked out at home and my body got in great shape.
Wow, I'm jealous ㅜㅜ But that also requires mental strength!
That's rightㅜㅜ It's not quite Ma Dong-seok, but it's similar to Kiki
Kiki, is that it?
Shouldn't that be something you're born with?
I really had a ton of belly fat, it was the best ever
You said you go on a family trip with your sister once a year!
Yeah, I was planning to go to Ulleungdo this time ㅠㅜ
Oh really? You can't go this year either?
Yeah, a round trip costs almost 1 million won and it’s not easy because of the weather…
Oh, is it because the weather is cold now?
I don't know, the weather on Ulleungdo is really important so boats don't sail often ㅠㅜ
I know a guy from Ulleungdo, and he said there are only two boats a day.
Oh really? That's why I guess you don't go on family trips?
Oh, we all have different travel tastes, so we don't go together.
Oh really? Why on earth are we family!
Kiki no we are a family that values our own time more hehe
I guess we all like to move around, Kiki
Kiki, thank goodness we are all different, with pensions being number one and restaurants being number one!
Everyone likes to go sightseeing and wander around. Kiki is better than a vacation.
Kiki, thank goodness. Where did you say you've been recently?
Where did you go with your family recently? It's been so long that I can't remember.
Do you often give relationship advice to your younger sibling?
No, not often. When we fight, sometimes we swear.
Kiki, you recently got a call from your little sister?
My boyfriend made a big mistake and I got a KakaoTalk message from him Kiki
What the hell is going on?
He said he broke up with his friend because he cheated on him and then they met again
Wow! Isn't Kiki's wind a huge deal!?
I think she broke up with that friend and forgave her boyfriend.
Oh my goshㅜㅜ My friend was more at fault!
I don't know, they both look the same, I guess they'll figure it out
Kiki, when you saw it, it was like kids dating, right?
That's right, no matter what I tell you, men won't listen to me when it comes to love, so Kiki, do what you want~
Kiki is so funny My sister's boyfriend is the same age as me so we fight
Oh really? Why are you fighting Kiki and hitting him so hard?
Kiki no Kiki I'm just playing with words!
No, my sister told me to call him brother-in-law!
I don't like it!
Oh, we're not married, but you call me brother-in-law? Kiki
Sister, did you say the cat was female?
No it's a male it's a man it's a man Kiki
Aah Kiki, you're so pretty I thought you were a female!
I want to hurry up and get off work to see Mayo~
Kiki Mayo I want to see you again too Mayo said you got neutered right?
Yeah Kiki, you're like my vitamin haha
Kiki Mayo, at what age did you have the surgery?
When I was little, I was a real dog and I wouldn't play around in the morning.
Kiki, I'm so jealous of you, our Obok doesn't have anything like that!
How much did your sister's surgery cost?
I think it came out to about 20, and they did tests and other things
I see. How many hours did the baby's surgery take?
But it hasn't even been 6.7 months, so I don't remember the sun or the dog.
I had our Obok quickly when he was 5 months old.
Yeah, that's what they said to do around that time.
That's right ㅜㅜ Our Oh Bok-i went to Daejeon and did it!
I was more nervous during the surgery Kiki
Sister, what brand of sportswear do you like?
I think Adidas is cute these days Kiki
Adidas~ You know that black jerseys are a must in high school, right?
Right Kiki, you wore Adidas too
Kiki Of course, a jersey is required over the uniform~
Ah, the school uniform is really ㅠㅠ so so memorable
Kiki, right ㅜㅜ But these days, Sechkies are the trend, so it's different from that!
Have you tried on the sexymix leggings? They're so good~
My friend asked me to buy her some leggings for her birthday too!
It's cheap and the quality is really good
And did you know that model Jessie was presented in the beginning?
I guess I can't not buy it?
Yeah, that's right, I knew Kiki Jessie since she was a model.
Kiki, that's right, I should buy one too. How much did you pay for a pair of leggings, sis?
I think I bought that for 20,000 won at a department store.
Kiki, is that a department store brand?
Is this a hit?
Yeah, that was at the Hyundai outlet.
Sister, I told you about the lottery game last time!
Yeah, that's the lottery game you said you won first place in?
Yeah, there's that game we used to play when we were kids. Do you know how much it costs these days?
How much is it?ㅜㅜㅜ Surely it can't be more than ten thousand won?
Huh? No, it was 100 won back then!?
How much is it? I guess there are still people who do that these days.
Kiki, I went to the stationery store with my friends and tried it. It went up to 500.
Wow, it costs 500 won to pick one?
Oh, in our time, we used to give condolences to first place, but now we don't even get condolences.
Then what is first place? What came out then, Kiki?
Kiki, what is this, a bulletproof bromide!? Something like that!?
That's so beggarly, what is that? Kiki, do you like that kind of thing?
Kiki But I asked the stationery store lady and she said that adults also come to pick those.
Oh my gosh, is it because of the squid game? Kiki
Kiki No, it was the year before last when I went Kiki
Oh, then adults just do it for fun
Sister, do you like mountains, valleys, and the sea?
I like mountains and the sea haha I don't really like valleys
Kiki, why? Isn't the valley the best?
The valley is kind of hot ㅠ I think it would be a good place to go when you get older
The valley is hot, huh?
Isn't this the coolest!?
I like the valley the best~
Really? I just like the ocean and the mountains make me feel at ease.
Kiki Ah, I admit it, so do you like playing in the ocean?
But I don't like water. Kiki doesn't go in and just looks.
Isn't the ocean too scary for me to play in?
Yeah... I feel uncomfortable when I go into the ocean and it's still hot ㅜ
Kiki, that's right, it's salty because it's the sea and salt water!
That's right, and there are a lot of people who die in the sea...
Kiki Hey, sis, have you seen the dead person?
No, that's not it ㅠㅠ Hehe I only saw it on the news
Kiki Right? That's why I never go in without a tube!
Yes, tube is a must, no matter where you go Kiki
Sister, what's the weather like in Daejeon today?
It looks like it's going to rain now~
Really? It's so hot in Nonsan right now!
Is it hot in Nonsan? My boyfriend went on a business trip and came back...
Oh my gosh, your boyfriend is a firefighter! What's going on?
I'm really going to exercise todayㅜㅜ The weather has to be nice
Kiki: Oh, right, but is it humid now?
Do you think it's going to rain?
I don't know, I'm just going to work out today and go eat tteokbokki
So that's why Kiki exercises!?
Of course I do it to eat. How is the weather in Seoul? Kiki
Kiki, our company is turning on the air conditioner right now^^
It's going to be hot again today when I take the hell train home from work...
Kiki, that's right, I'm hot even though I'm wearing thin long sleeves,
Wow, doesn't your head hurt when you turn on the air conditioner?
Hmm,,, I guess it's better than being hot!
No, but it's scary if you get air conditioning sicknessㅜㅜ
Sister, Shin Min-a is so popular these days!
Is it because of the drama called Cha Cha Cha?
Kiki, that's right, every commercial that Shin Min-a does is a huge hit!
Oh really? Shin Min-a has a good imageㅜㅜ
Right ㅠㅠ Unnie, do you know the brand called Kuron?
No, I don't know, but I think I've heard it somewhere
There's that bag brand, Shin Min-a is carrying it and it's currently sold out for the second time.
Oh seriously, why is that? Kiki Shin Min-a is super popular.
Kiki: So, do you know about the insurance called Permile?
No, I don't know anything ㅜㅜ I don't know anything
Kiki, I know, have you not seen Shin Min-a's commercial where she does this?
Yeah, I didn't see it. Maybe it's because I don't watch advertisements often...
Kiki, that's right ㅠㅠ This also became famous because of Shin Min-a. They said that Kiki's performance went up 300% in just 5 months. Isn't that a hit!?
Wow, Shin Min-ah, isn't it because of that drama? Kiki
No, this was before the drama came out!
Now the ads are going to keep coming in!
Wow, I have to watch the drama and buy a bag too.
Sister, did you know that there was an earthquake in Japan recently?
Yeah, I saw that article. Isn't it about Japan collapsing?
Japan has so many earthquakes that it wouldn't have collapsed with that magnitude, but it was still only a magnitude 5.0!
Even though I want to travel to Japan, I'm scared of an earthquake.
Kiki, this time it happened in Tokyo. If there was no corona, many people would have gone to Tokyo.
That's right... I can't go because of Corona, so I'm trying to experience it indirectly
Kiki, have you ever been to Japan?
No, I've only traveled within the country ㅠㅠ
Oh, I see. I've been to Osaka and Fukuoka.
There are so many temples around here!
Oh, but I really want to go to Japan to eat sushi Kiki
Kiki Ah Sushi is really delicious! If you go, you must try the 100 yen sushi!
What do you recommend about Japan?
I'll try it too when the coronavirus is over
But what do you think about things like your sister's grave?
Japan just has graves on the side of the road Kiki
Mom, what is the grave? I'm scared that there will be an earthquake...
Kiki Kiki In Japan, there are graves on the roadside, and there are graves in temples too.
I thought there were only graves in Korea, but I guess there are some in Japan too.
Is your sister getting braces right now?
No, I'm done with corrections. It's been a few years since Kiki was liberated.
Wow, wow, how long did it take you to do that?
2 years and 6 months?
When I got braces, it hurt so much I couldn't even eat tofu ㅜㅜ
Then, how old was your sister when you started doing it?
I first did it when I was 22 Kiki
I see. That's what hurts when you tighten it, right?
Yeah, that's right... but why do you suddenly want to get braces?
Oh, I'm okay down there, but because of the up there ㅜ
If you get braces, you'll look pretty ㅜㅜ I'm full of aesthetic confidence
Kiki: Well, that's a lot of money, isn't it?
I'm okay with the bottom, but I did it because of the top lol
Oh really? But did you do the top and bottom?
Yeah, I used to be an employee so I got it really cheap~
I'm jealous, when I asked, they asked for 500.
It's so expensive. Why is it so expensive? Braces are expensive to begin with.
When it comes to Mother Nature, is it better to take medicine rather than endure it?
Of course I should take medicine before I get sickㅜㅜ
Oh my gosh ㅜㅜ Do you have bad period cramps too, unnie?
Yeah I'm really swollen and my waist and bottom feel like they're going to fall out Kiki
Wow, my back really hurts too. Why does my back hurt when I have my period?
What I'm saying is-- I can't sleep well because my stomach hurts when I sleep...
Then what kind of medicine are you taking, sister?
What the heck is that six, spending all day getting your back banged!
Sister, do you know what EZ-RN is?
I'm eating that!
Easy Six, eat that! I remembered Kiki
Kiki Yeah, I switched to this too, after taking Tylenol!
Tylenol doesn't work, does it? Admit it?
No no I have it but it's said to be resistant to it ㅜ
I think I won't be able to do it because I've become resistant to itㅡㅡ
I see ㅜㅜ Still, it seems like it was a good decision to change it because the effect of EZ-LEN is no joke!
You absolutely have to take your medicine. Don't endure it. Only then can you work...
I bought some more clothes this time,
Oh, I see you've prepared your fall clothes?
Hey, did I tell you that I bought a pair of pants recently?
Hey, what is it! I want to buy a coat too, but I don't have enough money~
Kiki I recently bought some pants and they gave me a discount coupon for being a good customer~~
I lost all my online shopping this time haha
Kiki, really? What did you buy?
Pants, a cardigan, and a T-shirt - How about your pants? They fit you well and are pretty?
Oh, I bought something comfortable and got a good deal!
I feel bad because I look like a giant piece of clothing and it makes me feel bad ㅠ
Kiki Ah, but if the real thing is different from the picture, I want to find out!
Yeah, the reviews are okay, but why do I look like that?
Kiki, wasn't that review written by that company on purpose!?
Sister, you took the bait!
What I'm saying is that the pants are bell bottoms, but what size 180 should I wear? Kiki
Kiki, is this true? You didn't buy men's clothes, did you?
Noㅜ I tried putting the tea in my stomach and wearing it, but it didn't go in
Sister, do you know someone called Tasty Guy?
No, what is that? Is that an abbreviation for delicious guys?
That's right! Kim Jun-hyun won't be coming out anymore!
Comedians come out and just keep going around eating?!
That's right, Kim Jun-hyun, Kim Min-kyung, Moon Se-yoon, and another one I don't remember, but there were four of them!
Ah, why, why is it because of health?ㅜㅜ?
You sweat a lot...
Kiki, no, I went out for a little self-development!
The dog is cute, but Kim Jun-hyun and Kiki are the best. Did they make a lot of money? Hmm
Kiki, no, to Kim Jun-hyun, that place was like a pension, but he said he was leaving because he felt like he wasn't developing.
Wow... why is that? Even Kim Min-kyung eats really well on her own.
That's right, Kiki Kim Min-kyung's athletic ability is no joke!
Kim Jun-hyun appeared there a lot, and I saw Kiki doing a filter
Kiki Kim Jun-hyun did the filtering, not Kim Min-kyung?
No, Kim Man-kyung's core strength is no joke.
Oh right, Teacher Pilte also said that Kim Min-kyung is talented. Kiki
Yeah, yeah, I need to do a filter too ㅜ sob
Sister, have you by any chance watched all the dramas that IU was in?
No, I didn't really watch what IU didㅜㅜ
Have you not seen the drama that IU and Lee Jun Ki appeared in together?
Yeah I didn't see that one. It was popular.
Kiki, but you didn't see it!?
It was really fun ㅜㅜ
Yeah I saw IU eating that in Jeju Island Kiki
Ah, Kiki, is that the one with Lee Hyo-ri and the guesthouse?
You put it in your mouth and chew it, Kiki, you know the dust?
That's right Kiki is cute, but IU is also appearing in the movie that Lee Jun Ki is starring in!
Oh really? Looks like they're filming again. IU had fun watching the Lee Hyo-ri couple. Kiki
Kiki, that's right, I also enjoyed watching Hyori's Inn Kiki
Yeah, that's really fun. I wish Kiki and Hyori would do a guesthouse again.
Since Kiki 2 came out, wouldn't there be a 3rd one too?
But since then, the guesthouse has been really noisyㅜ in the surrounding area
Ah, then I won't do it anymore.
So I thought maybe I wouldn’t take a picture…
Isn't this your peak time now?
Yeah, I'm getting busy now so I might disappear Kiki
Kiki ah no ㅜ don't leave me ㅝ
Kiki, I can't help it... I have to eat to live ㅠㅠ
What time do you usually eat lunch?
We started eating around 2 o'clock ㅠㅠ
I see ㅜㅜ If I eat at 2 o'clock, what about dinner?
I'm going home to eat dinner after work ㅠㅠ
Kiki: Then what time does business end?
It closes around 7 or 8! Haha
Then, if I go home and eat, it will be around 9 o'clock, right?
Yeah, that's right ㅠㅠ But I have no choice but to eat together ㅠㅠ
Okay then I'll sleep late ㅜ
But then again, I'm lying down and playing on my phone, Kiki
Kiki, after eating, it's a good idea to lie down~
Then you just lie down and roll around and sleep haha
Did your sister move into a rented house?
Yeah, we're building an apartment right now, but we have to rent it out before we move in. ㅠㅠ
Oh my, my sister is moving into that new apartment building in Nonsan?
No, no, we're going to Gyeryong! Kiki
Aha, are you talking about Gyeryong Rishuville?
No, no, the area is Gyeryong! Kiki
Ah, if it's Kiki Gyeryong, it'll be further away from the restaurant?
Yeah, that's why I'm really worried right now ㅠㅠ
I see ㅜㅜ When are you planning on moving in?
I think I'll go once construction is complete, but I think it'll take about a year!
Oh, so you're saying I can move in next year?
Yeah, I guess I'll have to move in next year haha
Then I guess I'll have to buy all the furniture too?
Yeah, I have to buy them all ㅠㅠ I think it's going to cost a lot of money ㅠㅠ
But when you buy, you have to buy good things!
Yeah but I like it because it's stretchy haha
What kind of car does your sister's husband drive?
My husband drives a Grandeur Kiki
Oh, did you buy the new Grandeur this time?
No, no, I've been riding it for a long time! It's not a new model ㅠㅠ
But the Grandeur is still really good ㅜㅜ
Yeah, it's nice because it's spacious, Kiki
Yeah Kiki, I just rode the new model that came out and it's really good.
Everything new is good ㅠㅠ
Yes, I also rode the new Sorento and it was really good.
New Sorento?
I've never driven a Sorento before ㅠㅠ
Oh really? We have a 2010 Sorento at home Kiki
Oh, so it's been 11 years now?
Yeah, that's right. Oh, I guess it's the 2007 model, because I've been riding it since I was in elementary school!
Kiki, is it time for a change now?
Kiki, that's right, that's why I've done a lot of test drives.
I'll go and check it out later when I get a new one Kiki
Sister, have you ever worked at a company?
I used to go to a vet Kiki
Oh really? So, you were a nurse?
Well, not a nurse, but something similar! Kiki
I see. Did the doctor pay you a lot of money?
Should I just give a little more than the minimum? ㅠㅠ
Oh my goshㅜㅜ Is the work not that difficult?
Yeah, but it's kind of hard ㅠㅠ Animal care is no joke...
But why are you giving so little?
There's no way around it in capitalism... everyone gets what they deserve ㅠㅠ
Hahaㅜㅜ It's crying. How was it resting?
I think they rested when there were no customers ㅠㅠ
When was your day off?
Kiki, you seem to rest on weekends, you only work on weekdays!
Oh thank goodness a friend of mine had a day off like this on Sunday!
But where can I rest on Sundays ㅠㅠ I want to rest this weekend ㅠㅠ
Miyan, haha, I'm busier now haha
Yeah... That's why I miss those days a little bit, Kiki
Sister, which military branch do you think has the hardest job among the Navy, Army, and Air Force?
Hmm I think the Navy would be the hardest ㅠㅠ
Wow, I thought the same thing!
I thought it would be the hardest because there was water
Oh right, Kiki because of motion sickness
Yeah and once the ship leaves, your phone won't explode Kiki
Kiki Oh, but soldiers can't use cell phones anyway!
No, I heard that these days all soldiers get it?
Oh really? These days, they give away cell phones to everyone?
Yeah, I gave it all back after the training camp ended, Kiki
Wow, awesome Kiki. Then can I always carry it with me?
Yeah, so you said you've been keeping in touch with each other a lot lately, Kiki
Wow Kiki Latte got a call while waiting at a pay phone~
Kiki, the pay phone is right, we were waiting at that phone and that's what we said Kiki
Kiki, is that right? It started with 070, right?
Oh, did you get a call from 070?
I only remember the collect call Kiki
Sister, do you have any qualifications?
No, I don't have a license yet ㅠㅠ
Oh really? So you got a job right after graduating from high school?
Yeah, after graduation, I worked here and there, Kiki.
I see, Kiki, you're working harder than anyone else these days~
Well then ㅠㅠ I played hard back then so I have to work now ㅠㅠ
Kiki: Then, there are no qualifications you want to get?
Yeah, not yet. Do you just want to stay like this?
There is something I want to learn now!
Oh, what have you seen? Tell me, Kiki.
I want to learn about dog treats these days~
Oh, making dog treats?
How about cake?
Oh, great. There's an academy in Ansan that I really like, but it's too far away.
How long does it take from there to Ansan? ㅠㅠ
First of all, it takes 2 hours one way to get there from Seoul?
Oh my, it's not even a round trip, it's a one way trip? I give up ㅠㅠ
My sister's father also works without restㅜ
Yeah, that's right ㅠㅠ My dad has it harder than me ㅠㅠ
Rightㅜㅜ Dad, you work in that hot kitchen all dayㅜ
Yeah, and the oil splattered and stuff so I got burned ㅠㅠ
Oh, that's right, I worked at a Chinese restaurant too.
Oh right, you did it too ㅠㅠ Wasn't it hard?
Kiki I was a server so it was okay but I ordered a group order.
That's rightㅠㅠ When group orders come in, I get really busy and it's hellㅠㅠ
We live near a military base so there are a lot of soldiers there.
Oh, I see. I think pizza and chicken business will be really good there. Kiki
Oh right, did you know that there's something like a restaurant inside the Kiki military base?
Dad, how about coming in here?
Kiki, we're fine here too...
Kiki, if you and your dad go into a military base together, you won't be able to even pick up a bone.
Kiki, you're right, you're really having a hard time ㅠㅠ You're getting old, you're getting old ㅠㅠ
Right, Dad said the restaurant seats are good right now?
Yeah but I like it because we have the monopoly here Kiki
When are you planning on having a baby, Sister?
I'm going to get a house next year and I'm thinking about that later!
Oh, it would be really nice to have a baby in our new home ㅜㅝ
Yeah, so right now I'm just enjoying my honeymoon without thinking about it!
Kiki Oh, good, good. Did your sister get married this year?
Yeah, I did it in May this year~ It's been 5 months haha
Oh right, Kiki, then enjoy it enough
Yeah, I guess I should enjoy the moment haha
That's right, my friend is getting married in October and she's having a baby this time haha
Kiki, I guess you were preparing for the wedding. Kiki, you must be happy.
Kiki, you're right, I didn't care and now it's the 4th week!
Wow, I guess I'll have to keep checking dress sizes ㅠㅠ
Oh, I was on a strict diet, but now I'm only eating fruit.
No ㅠㅠ You have to eat well, it's not good for the baby ㅠㅠ
That's right Kiki, I'll send you a golden apple this time too!
Golden Apple Kiki I should look for that too Kiki
Sister, I recognized a turtle once.
Yeah, how about a turtle? Is it good to raise one?
Oh my, it's so good!
That light bulb? I think that'll be enough.
Oh, so you're telling me to raise two instead of just one?
Kiki No no, you're saying that you don't need as many supplies as you think!
Oh, so you mean turtles can live well alone? Kiki
Oh my, that's right. The turtle doesn't move at all, so it looks like some kind of furniture. Kiki
Kiki is so funny. I wonder if Kiki, the only one with furniture, is lonely and living well?
Kiki: But turtles don't live in groups, so I think it'll be okay?
But I think I'll look lonely if I'm alone ㅠㅠ
Then let's bring two guns!
Okay, I'll have to make two to make it look nice!
But the turtle I mentioned is a bit expensive haha
...No, if it's expensive ㅠㅠ I'd rather have something moderate ㅠㅠ
How much are you thinking, Kiki?
I thought it was around 300 ㅠㅠ
Sister, don't you like watching games at the stadium?
I'd like to see you at the stadium at least once!
I watched the baseball game and it was really fun!
Ah, I'm jealous ㅠㅠ What's it like to see it in person?
First, I have to go and order some chicken and beer!
Kiki, that's so obvious~ Again?
Kiki: Then~ My friend got a custom-made one-piece dress and wore it!
Wow, that's cool. Is that guy a huge baseball fan? Kiki
Kiki, you're right, you got the whole set!
Wow, it's cool to see such passionate friends, Kiki
Kiki admits Kiki we went together and watched it, we are Hanwha fans haha
Oh, then this is definitely Hanwha! Kiki
Kiki, that's right, it doesn't matter if we lose!
Just enjoy this moment~ Kiki
That's right, if Kiki wins, then I'll cry
Oh, you won ㅠㅠ I'm so touched Kiki But Hanwha fans are the biggest Kiki
Does your sister have a plus at home?
No ㅠㅠ I'm thinking about getting that when I move to a new place Kiki
Oh Kiki please go and play with me!
Kiki, what's wrong? We're going to enjoy our honeymoon. Kiki
Kiki Andang, please hug me too~ I want to do it too~
Kiki, let's have some fun and then I'll sing when I get used to it. Kiki
Kiki Oki But have you ever played a Plus game?
Noㅠㅠ I've never done it... But I think it'd be good to do it at home Kiki
Kiki, I also have that 3D game. I want to try it.
VR?
Are you talking about that game?
Kiki, that's right, you can do that with plus!
Oh really? Then I should look into that too, Kiki.
Kiki, but do you know how much the plus costs?
Yeah, I think that costs around 1 million won!
That's right, new products now differ depending on the options!
Right ㅠㅠ But I think it would be good to buy it once Kiki
Sister, have you been on a trip with your husband recently?
Our last honeymoon was in Jeju Island ㅠㅠ
Oh my god, then where haven't you been able to go for 5 months?
Yeah, it's not a good idea because of the coronavirus and I can't just close the store ㅠㅠ
Oh my gosh ㅜㅜㅜ I see ㅜㅜ Is there anywhere you want to go?
Yeah, I just want to spend the holidays together ㅠㅠ
Kiki, is there anywhere you want to go in particular?
Yeah, I had a rest over the weekend and it's Monday now ㅠㅠ I think I'll be happy just by having a holiday!
Kiki, wowㅜㅜ Next spring, let's go see the cherry blossoms at Donghaksa Temple!
Yeah, by then it will be our first wedding anniversary, so I should go to celebrate Kiki
Oh, it's so good! Let's go to Donghaksa and eat some pajeon too!
Yeah but it's a mess ㅠㅠ I think it would be nice if we just dated Kiki
Wow, let's go there and listen to the stream water flowing while eating dongdongju and pajeon!
I think I'd be happy just eating whatever they sell on the street haha
Kiki Oh right, there are a lot of delicious restaurants there!
There were quite a lot of them, and Kiki's Galbi House was really delicious ㅠㅠ
What season do you like the most, sister?
I think I like spring the best!
Late spring?
Oh really? You like it because you can see a lot of flowers?
No, I like it because the weather suits me Kiki
Sister, do you like slightly warm weather?
Yeah, I'm cold so I like something warm ㅠㅠ
Kiki Au, you're skinny, so you'll catch a cold a lot
That's why I hate winter so much ㅠㅠ It's so cold now ㅠㅠ
Dirt ㅜㅜ That's right, it's very dangerous outside the winter blanket~
Yeah, so I wanted to quit then, Kiki, I didn't want to go out, Kiki
Tell Kiki's dad that we should just go and look at the flowers for a bit!
Kiki, you should do that too. Dad, you should get some fresh air and relieve your stress. ㅠㅠ
That's right ㅜㅜ You have to take it easy!
Yeah, you're older now ㅠㅠ
Oh my gosh, you're right. Now is the time to enjoy your old age comfortably!
Kiki is old ㅠㅠ My dad isn't that old yet ㅠㅠ
There was a woman who died from dating violence recently.
Dating violence?
Isn't that murder, not violence? ㅠㅠ
Right, do you know why that guy was violent?
Oh, really? Why did you hit me?
The woman bragged to her friends that she was dating him.
Huh? No, if you date, you date. Why is that a valid reason?
So, they were dragging the unconscious person's hair and stomping on him.
Wow, the dog is really crazy. So what's the punishment?
So the lawsuit is in progress now, but how many years will it take if this guy appeals?
No, he should just live in prison. He's a murderer.
That's right, you're crazy, a murderer disguised as dating violence
What I'm saying is... those kinds of people should just be buried in society ㅠㅠ
Yeah, but you know what's even more frustrating?
Is there anything more upsetting than this?!
The dead victim's face was revealed as is, but the killer's face and identity were not revealed.
Wow, that's really ridiculous.
It's not like I'm joking, so why hide it? It has to be made public.
Starting from the 15th of next month, you can travel to Singapore without quarantine!
Oh wow! So you can go back and forth there? ㅠㅠ
Oh my god, that's right. I was supposed to self-quarantine for two weeks!
Yeah, that's right, you have to do it back and forth, but now you don't have to do it?
That's right! But that's only in Singapore!
I think a lot of people will flock there ㅠㅠ
Kiki, that's right, I wanted to go to Singapore too!
Yeah, I'm more attracted to that country because I've never been there. Oh yeah
Kiki, that's right, but where is Singapore located?
Ah, I don't know about that ㅠㅠ But it won't be far!
That's right, my friends said they went on a trip to Singapore and it was really worth it!
Yeah, I heard that 3 nights and 4 days is enough for a trip there!
Oh really? Isn't overseas basically 4 nights and 5 days!?
Yeah, that's a really small country, but Kiki said there's enough money there?
Oh my, Kiki, you remind me a little of Taiwan~?
Kiki Ah but Taiwan wasn't even enough for a week Kiki
Sister, what kind of cosmetics do you use these days?
Basic cosmetics?
Or color cosmetics?
Um, color cosmetics!?
Something like lipstick?
Ah, I use MAC a lot for lipstick and Kiki lip balm!
As expected, women use a lot of Mexican lipstick!
I think I use tint more than lipstick! But I use lip balm more ㅠㅠ
Ahh me too ㅜㅜ I use Benefit's!
Oh, that thing that looks like nail polish?
Yeah, that's right, but it doesn't come out like that anymore
Huh? Then it comes out differently?
How does it come out?
It just looks like I applied tint
Ah, does lip balm just come in a stick form?
I use Lush lip balm!
Rush?
Is there lip balm there too?
Oh yeah, they sell lipstick there too Kiki
Wow, wow, amazing. Kiki's scent is definitely good. Kiki
Your mother said she wasn't feeling well, but what exactly is wrong with her?
Oh, you must be very tired because a lot of people came. ㅠㅠ
Oh my goshㅜㅜ Please make me some herbal medicine!
Yeah, Mom, I'm resting right now, traveling, and healing, so I'm okay Kiki
Oh really? Who are you traveling with?
Kiki, I've been traveling with my friends lately
Oh, you're healing~ Where did you go this time~
I think you're going to see the fall foliage this time, Kiki
Okay, so you went hiking this time?
Yeah, I think so. Since we are adults, we go hiking and see flowers and stuff. Kiki
Oh, hiking is the best exercise for adults!
I hope you go there safely and don't get hurt ㅠㅠ
Are you going to climb a high mountain this time?
I don't know much about mountains so I don't know ㅠㅠ Just make sure you don't get hurt wherever you go!
Kiki, that's right!
Did you give me some pocket money?
My nose is a master's degree, so I can't do that~
Don't you and your husband invest in stocks or something?
Um, I told you not to, but I think you're doing it secretly, Kiki.
Ahh Kiki, after all, men are supposed to give stocks~
These days, a lot of women do it too ㅠㅠ
Yeah my friends are just starting out too ㅜ
Wow, guys, you must have tasted some money now.
Kiki, no, it's all minus. Kiki, they all live like that.
Kiki, who really makes money with stocks? They're all minus signsㅡㅡ
Kiki, that's right, but why didn't you use Bitcoin?
Kiki Bitcoin I don't know if people are still making a lot of money Kiki
First of all, my boyfriend's boss quit his job because he earned 1.7 billion won. Kiki
Wow, that's awesome.. Then that's worth trying to turn your life around Kiki
That's right, I paid off my debt at home and went on a trip around the country and abroad in 2018.
Wow, wow... How much did you invest to earn that much?
I don't know about that, but I think he said he put all his retirement money in at that time.
It must have cost more than 10 million won ㅠㅠ Wow, this is really amazing ㅠㅠ
Sister, what do you think of Lee Byung-hun's acting?
Aren't you tired?
Yeah, your acting is really good ㅡㅡ
Hah, I saw the Namsan bosses this time, they were awesome
Hey, is there anything else besides squid?
This came out a long time ago, but it was released on Netflix!
Ah, then I should take a look. Kiki, who else will appear?
Kiki, do you know the actor named Lee Hee-jun?
Noㅠㅠ I don't know Kiki, is he handsome? Kiki
Huh? If you try hitting on me, you'll know?
Really? Then I'll have to try it out before I watch it. What's the content like?
This is based on a true story, so the content is solid!
Wow, it's based on a true story, the content is really great ㅠㅠ
Oh my god, this is a story about what happened during the Park Chung-hee regime!
Oh, then I think I'm going to shed some tears ㅠㅠ
Right ㅜㅜ But isn't there a scene where Lee Byung Hun is quietly angry?
I'm really fed up!
Kiki I'll try to drive around before I go to bed tonight~
It's been a long time since I've seen Dad's black rubber shoes.
Black rubber shoes cartoon? Kiki
Is that still on air?
No, I just watched the rebroadcast on YouTube!
Are you rewatching old stuff?
Oh my, that's right. Have you seen Kiki's black rubber shoes before?
Yeah I really enjoyed that, Kiki
Sister, did you see the steamed bun episode?
What was that about? ㅠㅠ I think I need to tell you so you can understand ㅠㅠ
That grandma who sells dumplings and steamed buns!
It's been so long that I don't remember even if you say it like that ㅠㅠ
I cried when I saw this ㅜㅜ
Oh my gosh ㅠㅠ I should look it up sometime when I feel like crying ㅠㅠ
That's right ㅜㅜ My grandmother can't count money, so the kids tend to go after that ㅜㅜ
Oh my gosh ㅠㅠ They can do that because they're kids, but they shouldn't do that ㅠㅠ
That's right, but when that grandmother passed away, she donated all her assets to Ki-cheol's school as a scholarship.
Wow, he donated the money he earned from doing business and left... It's heartbreaking...
Oppa, I want to eat tteokbokki!
Hey, my lover next to me is also complaining Kiki
Kiki, I heard that the new Yeoptteok menu item is famous these days!?
Are you sure you're getting cream tteokbokki truffle?
Is this what you're talking about?
Oh, right! Have you tried that, oppa?
No, there's someone singing next to me right now, Kiki
Kikikiki, eat it tomorrow because it's Friday!
No - I hate feeling stuffy!
Wow! My girlfriend wants to eat it!
Don't eat that either!
Hey, my boyfriend doesn't want to eat it, so I shouldn't eat it.
Kiki Hugh, then how about the rose tteokbokki that came out before?
Hmm, that looks kind of edible!
Yeah, that's not spicy and it's delicious!
Oh but I'm also a spicy person ㅠㅠ
Kiki, I guess my girlfriend should just eat with her friends~
Yeah, that sounds good, good friends with good tastes~
Are you smoking right now, oppa?
Yeah I get bullied a lot for doing that
Then how do you smoke it at home?
There are two bathrooms in my house, so I go into one and do it.
So your parents know that your brother smokes?
Yeah, I know you hate it because it smells so bad Kiki
Kiki, how many packs do you smoke a day!?
I think I'll just smoke a pack or so Kiki
Wow, awesome, what are you talking about, oppa?
I don't know if you've heard of Moebius!
No I only know SL Life Kiki
Kiki, where did you hear that from Kiki?
When I was little, my dad would run errands for me
Everyone learns from their dad, right? Kiki
Kiki: Then oppa, do you throw away cigarette butts in the bathroom trash can?
Just put it in water, put it out, and throw it in the trash!
Have you ever driven an electric car, oppa?
No, I didn't ride an electric car because there were no electric vehicles around, but I rode an electric bicycle!
Electric bicycle,?
Oppa, did you buy one?
No, it's not that I bought it, but there are a lot of electric bikes when I go out to play~
Ah Kiki, does it feel a bit like a scooter in Jeju Island?
Yes, these days there are quite a few electric bicycles in Udo.
Oh my gosh, Kiki, have you tried that?
Yeah I came riding that this time Kiki
Wow! How much is that for an hour?
No, this is really great because it has unlimited time and costs 15,000 won!
Wow! Amazing! Why is it so cheap?
Wow, I really like it. I'll ride it again when I go there.
How fast is that?
It's definitely fast enough to overtake the cars in front of you.
Kiki Huh? Then all the scooters will disappear!
Right Kiki, if you know how to ride a bike, borrow this and do it Kiki
Oppa, what did you say you wanted to learn back then?
I have so many things I want to learn that I can't even remember Kiki
Kiki: Then, do you have any plans to learn a foreign language or something?
I tried Yanado before, but Kiki was a total failure
Kiki Oh, I tried that too. It didn't work~
Kiki, how many times did you hear that before you gave up?
How much have you heard?
I've never heard of it!
Real story? You've never really heard of it?
Oh, I don't even remember?
I remember listening to it for a week, Kiki
Kiki, how long should I take that class to extend it? No one listened to it Kiki
Kiki, you guys are really great too, I was like that too Kiki
Kiki, even if you don't listen, someone has to turn it on somehow Kiki
I did it because they said it would take 10 minutes a day?
But I didn't do it because I felt betrayed after more than 10 minutes, Kiki
Kiki I'm a beginner so they didn't teach me ABC Kiki
What I learned there was not enjoyment, but artificiality, Kiki
Have your friends ever come to visit you in the military?
We all went in around the same time so there was no such thing ㅠㅠ
So have you ever been with a friend you were assigned to?
No, the assignments aren't the same and they're all torn apart ㅠㅠ
Yeah? Did you have a friend who enlisted at the same time?
No, of course Kiki, that's why it's torn Kiki
Oh, I see. So you went around the same time?
Yeah, but I became really close with my younger siblings there.
But is there really such bullying as that in DP?
Yeah, that's true, but I had a really fun life!
That's really fortunate, I guess I just have to meet good people!
First of all, I have a mischievous personality, so I played with Kiki a lot.
Kiki, thank goodness you had a girlfriend back then?
Yeah, I remember asking my friend to deliver flowers to me back then, Kiki.
Oh my god Kiki, you're still going on dates with that girlfriend!?
No, we broke up and met someone new now.
Oh, so how much did you pay to learn Yanado?
My memory is a bit hazy, but I think it was around 40 or 50?
Wow, oppa, did you pay all that money for it?
Yeah, I have colleagues that I worked with... Kiki
Kiki Hul, how many people did you do it with?
There are three of us including me. Kiki, I guess I should have just told my friends to listen to the ID later. Kiki
Kiki it's okay I thought it would be okay if you did that Kiki
But if there were several people, wouldn't it have been extended by a year if they had made a resolution for three days each?
Kiki, the deadline has just increased, but my knowledge hasn't increased.
Yeah and I think there was a limit on the number of people for that too Kiki
Kiki, wouldn't it have been better if you just rotated the IDs?
But then again, Kiki was so young and innocent
Kiki, how old were you at that time?
I think I was about 24 at that time, Kiki
Wow Kiki, then you were really young!
Yeah Kiki is very innocent and doesn't know anything haha
Are both of your parents over 60?
No my parents haven't come yet, look forward to it soon haha
Then, even if we don't have a 60th birthday party, we should still eat together, right!?
Let's go out for a meal with the family Kiki
Yes, we are turning 60 soon, Dad.
I bet you guys have a lot of parties for your 60th birthday and retirement.
Ha, how much should I measure my allowance at?
Shouldn't you give a lot when you're 60?
I have 1.3 million won in assets, so should I sell my soul?
You have a lot. I have 40,000 won right now. Kiki.
Kiki, where did all the money I earned go?
Today is my payment day... so I got scammed... Kiki
Wow, is this true? How much did it cost? ㅜㅜ
I got 1 million won this month ㅠㅠ I'm going to do it ㅠㅠ
Hot, oppa, I need to save money quickly ㅜㅜ
You earn some money for me and help the less fortunate haha
When are you getting married, oppa?
I don't have any thoughts yet, maybe around 34?
Are you getting married in Nonsan, oppa?
Or where are you going to do it?
First of all, since my house is in Nonsan, why not do it in Nonsan?
Is there a good wedding hall in Nonsan?
There's always one place where people do this Kiki
Kiki, isn't that a famous Palbochae restaurant there?
No, the water here is delicious, Kiki
Water? Oh, so you mean it tastes bad?
Yeah that's right so when I go I eat kimbap and kimchi haha
A friend of mine is getting married next year and the cost of food alone is 60,000 won. So how much should I give as a wedding gift?
One meal ticket costs sixty thousand won?
Doesn't that sound nonsensical?
Oh, they grill steak there and serve lobster too.
Oh, is that a wedding hall inside a hotel? Kiki, it was really nice.
I should give at least 100,000 won as a congratulatory gift, right?
Yeah, judging from the amount you mentioned, it means you'll die if you pay 50,000 won ^^
What kind of food do you give your outdoor dog?
We just bought what we bought at the hardware store.
Kiki's hardware store, is this true? Kiki
But I think I know too, Kiki
You know that thing the size of a rice sack?
I bought that 20kg and gave it to Kiki
Wow, that's right Kiki. Then does the baby enjoy eating that?
Yeah, I always give it to him so he eats it well, but he sometimes complains.
Kids raised outside are usually given leftover food!
Yeah, I give it to you sometimes too Kiki
Kiki When I was little, I used to have rice wrapped in seaweed soup as a special meal!
Oh, if it's seaweed soup, it's a special dish. We gave them sweet and sour pork. Kiki
Kiki and Kiki the Baby are going crazy, so they won't eat their food!
Sometimes they give pig's feet too, and he eats them very well.
Do you know that they hide bones and then the kids forget about them?
Are you that stupid? Kiki is cute haha
Kiki, if you find it, then eat it Kiki
But the pig's feet bones are so big I think it'll be hard to eat haha
Honey, have you ever played table tennis?
Yeah, I think I did it in elementary school. Kiki
When I was in elementary school?
Where have you tried it?
There's a public sports field here, and there's a table tennis court there. Kiki
Oh right, they do a lot of that there!
Who did you do it with then, oppa?
I went there with my family and did a lot of things Kiki
I guess your parents like table tennis!?
No, when other relatives came to visit, I had nowhere to go, so I went there, Kiki.
Oh my gosh, Kiki, there really wasn't a bowling alley back then?
First of all, there was no one in my house who played bowling at that time!
Then, if you do it with your family, do you have competitions or something?
I think back then it was just about scores Kiki
Kiki: Oh, right. We went bowling a lot!
You must be pretty good at bowling now, Kiki
I'm 40 now? Is that okay?
Wow, that's similar to me, I'm 30!
Oppa, did you have a Go board at home?
Yeah, of course we had a Go board at home Kiki
Then, oppa, you played Alkkagi instead of Baduk?
You shouldn't even take out the Go board, you should do it on the table Kiki
Kiki, why? Isn't it more fun to play on a Go board?
No, I have to do this again, sending it far away haha
Kiki, really? Then, oppa, are you good at telling me?
I think it's a bit more than I thought Kiki
Kiki I'm so good I know you God!
Oh, your finger control seems to be very free haha
Okay, okay~ My fingers are small, but I have good control!
Kiki, kids with small hands are good at doing that kind of cute thing.
Kiki, that's right, that's me~
There are more and more things I have to deal with next!
Kiki oppa goes first and I'll take one of the stones away~ Handicap~
Kiki I'm not that bad, but I won't refuse if you let me see it~
Honey, do you know Seongsu-dong in Seoul?
No, I know Samseong-dong, but I don't know Seongsu-dong Kiki
Kiki, if you go there with your girlfriend, she'll really like it, right?
Why do you like it when there's something there?
Yeah, there's a place that has all the Amore cosmetics!
Oh, is that something that was floating around the internet a long time ago?
That's right, there's also a Sherlock Cafe on the second floor!
Looks like you spent a lot of money there, Kiki
Just by entering there, you'll be given a few samples!
There's also something like Sulwhasoo!
Oh, if you bring that to moms, they'll really like it Kiki
There are IOPE and Hera samples too!
Can you pick that out and bring it?
Oh, there are several sample baskets!
Just get 5 from there!
Oh, then I should visit there sometime when I pass by!
And I can make my own foundation and lipstick!
Kiki, is it okay to go and get 5 every day?
Oppa, I heard it's raining in Daejeon now. How is it there?
Daejeon? This is not Daejeon, it's Nonsan!
But still, Daejeon and Nonsan are in the same Chungnam region!
But it takes 40 minutes by car?~
Kiki: If it takes 40 minutes, the weather will be pretty similar!
No, if it stops raining there, we can come here!
Kiki: That might be true, but does that mean you're not coming there right now?
Yeah, it's not raining here yet.
So are you coming from Daejeon to Seoul?
First, check if your cousin is there~
Kiki's cousin is in Suwon right now,
Oh, then it will rain there!
Kiki Weather Fairy is planning to stay in Suwon for a long time ㅜ
My lover is a real weather fairy, so it won't rain here~
Kiki, really? Isn't that the guy who brings the rain?
My lover has never seen rain since he went to Jeju Island.
Oppa, I know someone named Ham So-won who was famous until last year.
Yeah, I know, but he's not a total scammer, right?
That's right, it's gone to hell now.
I'm really, really disappointed in Jinhwa
Yeah, that's true, but now there's controversy!
There's always controversy there. What's it about this time?
Yeah, the flower one-piece costs 170,000 won.
But why was that controversial?
It was posted on a shopping mall they run, and they said it was custom-made, but it was blatantly made in China.
But if you live in China, isn't it true that even custom-made things are made in China?
But you're in Korea right now, and you take some really ridiculous pictures of your clothes!
Why did you take such a mess of pictures of your clothes and post them?
No, if it's a one piece, you have to take a full body shot, but there's only a selfie.
What is that? Are you active on SNS? Kiki
One Piece was listed at 170,000 won, but 70% of the shares are only Kiki's face
Kiki, I have no idea what you're posting for me to see haha
Honey, didn't you buy an iPhone this time?
Yeah I bought one but it's not mine Kiki
Oh, didn't you say that was your lover's?
Yes, I bought one as a gift for Kiki.
Kiki, you did well. If you had bought it next year, it would have been more expensive, right?
Why? The price of the iPhone will go up a lot next year?
Oh, maybe? I heard there's a semiconductor shortage right now!
That's right, so they said semiconductor stocks would go up, but why is Samsung like this?
Kiki Samsung, the captain is out right now ㅜ
The captain is here, but why are you absent again? It's annoying...
Sir, you're just settling in. Just hold on a bit!
Yeah, that's right ㅠㅠ iPhone, but how much will the price go up next year?
Rather than going up by a certain amount, they are reducing production by 10 million units!
Oh, so you're saying it's a limited edition? Do you know what luxury brand Kiki is?
Yeah but I guess a lot of people will buy it again!
Yeah, apps like mine are like that ㅠ I guess I'll just go back to Samsung hehe
Did you get your eyebrows tattooed, oppa?
No, my eyebrows are originally dark Kiki
Oh I don't know how to change my boyfriend's eyebrows!
Brother, did you not originally have eyebrows?
No, there are eyebrows, but they're a bit angry eyebrows?
Oh but you can't just remove all your eyebrows ㅠㅠ
Yeah, it's so angled like an angry bird!
But since your face is so innocent, it's okay to be angry about your eyebrows!
Kiki, is that so?
But then again, men wouldn't look good with straight eyebrows, right?
Or go to a design waxing place and get it plucked out.
Oh, really? I'm just cutting down on the surroundings.
Also, it's different from what experts do, so go and try it once.
Oh, I guess so. There must be a place like that in Seoul, right?
Of course there are some here too, but there must be a lot there!
Oh, thank you for the good information!
Kiki, I also listen to it because my girlfriend does it all the time...
Brother, Mother Nature happened to me,
Mother Nature? What's going on?
Really?
No, it's something that women do once a month,
Oh, they said that was the worst. Does it hurt?
Yeah, I'm so sick right now,
Is there any way for that not to hurt?
Oh, doesn't your girlfriend talk about this kind of thing often?
Kiki is so sensitive, we always fight a week before we come
Kiki, in times like that, you really have to put up with it,
But I can't check every day if I'm coming, so we keep fighting
Kiki Oppa, I'll install a good app on your phone Kiki
Isn't that always accurate?
But most of the time, they are all correct!
Just say that if a dog gets really angry, it will come soon. Kiki
Kiki, in that case, just buy me something delicious!
When that happens, I don't feel well and I don't eat Kiki
I told you earlier that I'd tell you about a good app, right?
Yeah, you know I don't usually install apps, right?
Still, try installing it once for your girlfriend!
Is this the kind of app that girls would like? Kiki
Oh, it's an app that tells you your menstrual cycle. I saw it and thought about buying it for my boyfriend.
Kiki, that's an app for me, not for my girlfriend. Kiki
So I'm going to tell you a little secret!
Can't you set up a separate calendar on a regular cell phone?
No, it's called Pink Diary, install this!
Oh, if I install that, will I be able to avoid fights anymore?
Oh, if you pick a starting day, she'll tell you the expected cycle!
I guess I'll have to watch it for a while Kiki
Kiki is right, and if you look here, they're selling things that are good for women, so it'd be better if you bought them!
Kiki, I don't think you're the type to use something like that
No, I'm uploading things that women often use, so take a look. OnePlusOne is also good at it!
I think it would be better to just buy something that makes you feel good!
Honey, have you ever seen Exercise Fat on YouTube?
Oh, are you talking about Kim Min-kyung?
Oh right Kiki, you're the wannabe of all hells. Kiki
I saw that guy shoot a gun and it was really cool Kiki
Oh, that? I saw that too. What can't you do?
Phew hit, phew hit, phew hit. Are you better than a man?
Kiki is right and her body balance is also right so she looks stable!
That's right, so I watched it and admired it too, Kiki
Did you see Kiki Kim Min-kyung boxing?
Oh, I think I saw that picture of the teacher flying away.
Kiki, that's right Kiki, that's a real deal!
Yeah, he seemed really surprised, Kiki
Kiki, did you see the wrestling clip of Jung Hyung-don that appeared in the old dance?
Are you talking about that thing where you lie flat and turn over?
Oh Kiki Jung Hyung Don gave his two legs, but they were heavier than expected, so the wrestler fell over Kiki
Wow Kiki is so funny. I think it must have been an embarrassing situation for both of them. Kiki
Then, oppa, you don't like things like comics?
What are you talking about? Don't you know that men are one-of-a-kind?!
There's Wonable, but there's also Slam Dunk!
Yeah, I've seen that a lot, and I've also seen Haikyuu!
Wow, wow, Kiki Haikyuu was a dodgeball manga?
No, that's a volleyball manga~ Bread Sister~
Oh right! I also wanted to see that cartoon because of Kim Yeon-kyung~
I saw it at first and then didn't watch it, but it's on Netflix so I'll watch it!
That's right, Kiki, there are times when Netflix disappears, so I have to watch it before it disappears!
Yes, there are some that disappear over time, so you have to watch them when they come out.
Kiki, right? Was that the manga where the famous line &quot;Haikyuu only uses his left hand?&quot; came from?
Oh really? Is that the famous line there?
Isn't it a slam dunk?
Ahhhh that's right slam dunk!
It's from a basketball manga!
Kiki, you're looking at so many different things, you must be confused because it's all mixed up Kiki
Kiki, that's right Kiki, next time I have to watch Prince of Tennis!
Oh, that's a cartoon my girlfriend really likes. Kiki
Does your grandmother like any kind of fruit?
Of course I like apples ~ What about you?
I like watermelon the best
So that's why I peeled apples for my grandmother every day!
Yeah, that's right, our house is not empty of apples.
Kiki, do you have a favorite place to buy apples?
I ordered it separately from the internet
Do you like to shop at the post office when you have internet access?
Yeah, or you can order it at Homeplus Mall
How much do you pay for a box?
I bought about 5kg for 40,000 won. It was cheap.
40,000 won for 5 kilos is pretty expensive, isn't it?
But it varies by variety, so you can't help it if you want to buy a good one.
Then, does your grandmother like apples?
The adverb is the most delicious Kiki
Hongok is okay too!
Kiki, is there a place that sells horok these days?
Then now is the season for Hongok~
How often does your grandmother clean the house?
Of course you should do it once every half day Kiki
Kiki, that's why it was so clean when you got home~
Yeah, that's because I lose a lot of hair.
Kiki: Well, both the first and second children don't seem to shed much hair, right?
There are quite a few black haired beasts
Kiki Oki I also clean up even a single strand of hair in my studio apartment!
It's easy to clean with box tape.
Where can I buy Kiki box tape?
Go to a place like Daiso and buy a bunch~
A roll of box tape would cost about two thousand won, right?
Things are cheap there, so you can buy them for a thousand won~
Oh, is it good?
I should buy that next time, not Dol Dol!
It sticks well because it has good adhesiveness
Kiki, that's right, it hurts so much even if it sticks to your skin
That's why it's perfect for cleaning hair.
How does your mom go to the supermarket?
It's right in front of you on foot
Huh? I don't think I've seen it. Where is it?
There's a Lotte Mart in about 7 minutes~
Oh really? Why didn't I know that?
I was busy eating at home after work, so that's why~
Aha Kiki, is Lotte Mart also like Homeplus?
No, it's like a supermarket, it's small
Really? Is there a lot of parking space?
There is no parking lot there, so you have to walk.
It would be inconvenient for people to go there!
So it's a neighborhood business~
Kiki, can I register my membership card there too?
Yes, if you register as a Lotte member, you will earn points~
Then little mom, you'll be totally VIP there!
No haha vip should be written in hundreds of millions
Is your mom enjoying yoga now?
It's good, but I'm old and have no strength~
But, there's no set retirement age for your grandmother, right?
Oh, something like retirement age?
There are only 10 years left ㅜ
Wow, they have a retirement system there too?
As you get older, it gets harder and harder to maintain your body.
ㅜㅜ Is your grandmother a full-time employee there?
no
I'm a freelancer so I earn as much as I work.
Oh my gosh ㅜㅜ Then you wouldn't be enrolled in the 4 major insurance plans?
Yeah, so I'm only paying income tax.
Oh, I see ㅜㅜ
Do you have something like pension insurance?
I signed up for national pension separately
For my old age~
That's a relief ㅜㅜ
Are you having a hard time right now?
Then it's hard because the income has decreased ㅠ
ㅜㅜ Are you having class today too?
At 9 o'clock?
I only have personal time on weekends and only work on weekdays.
Little Mom, did you see the article this time?
Hey, what article was published?
This is a soldier who was found to have died from military assault after 37 years!
Oh really? It was like that a lot during the late Joseon Dynasty.
At that time, a military official told the bereaved family that this person just collapsed while playing soccer!
Oh. How badly must you have been hit to die?
And then they cremated the body as they pleased without letting me see it!
There are a lot of hidden incidents and accidents in the military~
Right, but do you know how it was revealed after 37 years?
Well, maybe they were trying to cover it up again?
No, the people who were involved in the incident at the time have now opened their mouths and found out!
What's the point of opening it now? It's been a long time since he died. It's ridiculous.
They said that they said it because they thought it would be a regret for eternity if they died without saying a word.
Actually, I'm just a bystander.
I said this because I wanted to lighten your load.
Yeah, I think it's too selfish to the end.
So what is the bereaved family's position?
Little Mom, didn't you make your second son study a lot?
But I don't get good scores because my head is full of shit
Didn't you say you had private tutoring back then? Kiki
Yeah, but I got a grade of 8-9 and got beat up
Second, you graduated from a humanities department? Not a vocational department?
So you went to the humanities department?
Kiki, if you get a grade of 8 or 9, it's really a waste of tuition money~
Well, that's why you didn't send him to college.
I don't want to waste money
Kiki, that's great. What does the second one want to do?
I want to do a ceremony at a wedding hall
Is that a career with a vision for the future?
These days, a lot of people have small weddings.
Kiki, just come out and tell me to get my driver's license first~
Did you know that I was going to do that too but stopped?
Oh, I know, I know~ The second one is a joke~
I'm dying because I went three times and got a refund.
We have a group chat
What do you think about that?
Oh, a family chat room?
It's so quiet I don't know~
Kiki Recently, my second uncle's birthday was, but no one talked about it Kiki
Was it like that?
I didn't know
Originally *these people were indifferent
I knew it was my birthday too, but I forgot because of work ㅜ
You remembered something I didn't even know
Kiki No, I forgot in the end too,
Well, isn't your aunt's 60th birthday coming up soon?
Yes, you are turning 60 this year.
So where did you say you were going on a trip?
Oh really?
You're already 60 years old
Where are you traveling?
I don't know about that, but I think your aunt's birthday is in November?
Yeah, that's right
My daughter and I have similar birthdays
Yeah Kiki
*There are a lot of winter birthdays in the C family~
Well, that's almost all winter birthdays~
that's right
First of all, it's January for me~
February is the month of my two sons, Kiki and Big Daddy
Grandma, have you ever seen your eldest daughter's boyfriend?
Then I came last time and ate ribs
Oh really?
In what month did you do that?
I came around April and ate like that~
Oh, how's your boyfriend?
Do you have a good personality?
The kid just looks so innocent and innocent~
Kiki looks innocent?
Oh, now that I think about it, that seems to be the case!
He seems like a good listener
Have you seen it?
Kiki I've never actually seen you, I've only called you a few times!
I heard you met your sister once
Oh really?
When did you meet your sister?
They said they went to the valley together and played in the water in the summer.
Wow, you had a double date?
no
The vice consul went with his daughter.
Kiki, the one who ate a plate of eggs? Kiki
Yeah, I don't know how the age is correct.
Grandma, don't you plan on raising a turtle?
It smells like turtle so it's not that good
No, tortoises don't smell much!
Yeah? Um, you mean your pet turtle?
Yeah, that's right, but they say he can live for about 100 years!
If I raise it at home for 100 years... I will die first.
Now I have to pass it on to my grandchild~
You want to pass down turtles from generation to generation?
It's not even a golden turtle...
Kiki but it's a golden turtle lol
Don't you know what a tortoise is?
Well, I don't know because I only saw the pet turtle.
They're only the size of a palm
This guy is as big as a small dog!
If you bite, your finger won't be cut off
I'm scared so I can't raise it
Kiki, if you leave it alone, it will grow up well on its own~
That's true, though.
Animals are not very attractive
Kiki, then your little mom will be scared to come to our house~
The turtle is having a hard time...
Mom, don't you do any other exercises besides yoga?
summer solstice
Kiki goes hiking every weekend
Aside from hiking, is there any other exercise you want to do?
Well, I need to go on a diet
I need to go to the gym
Golf is popular these days~
Don't you plan on doing it?
Golf is a sport for the privileged and it's expensive so I can't do it ㅠ
No~ I heard that these days people buy used golf clubs and play~
I see you have a lot of golf clubs at home. Can I get one for you?
Oh, use that~
Dad, you can't use all that anyway~
Grandpa likes playing golf~
Kiki, seriously, I'd rather cancel my membership and let you go to the golf course.
Why do we still have homemade golf courses?
Kiki, there's a spider web right now and dad had an accident.
What happened to cause this?
My dad broke the rooftop window while playing golf!
Wow nice buddy~
Well done
Grandma, didn't you play with air toys like that when you were little?
I was the best at hitting the jackpot
Grandma, you're a woman, so you don't do things like play with rubber bands?
It was popular a few years ago and was like playing tag in the air in my time~
When Kiki was little, wasn't throwing pitchforks popular?
There were a lot of folk games, but they were only played during the sports day.
Did your grandmother go to elementary school or elementary school?
Of course it's elementary school...
Elementary school changed after a long time
Kiki: Was there something called a sports day back in elementary school?
Then you know what happened, Park?
Kiki, I know too!
You threw a sandbag at the park and it blew up!
Kiki, there are red bean bags instead of sand bags.
I threw it away
Oh right, it was Kiki's red bean bag!
I played on the blue team the most!
Well, I don't remember much about our time.
We split into blue team and white team!
That's true~
It's been so long that I can't remember clearly
Where is your hometown, Grandma?
Was it Andong?
I'm from Yecheon, Gyeongbuk, but I don't know anything about it.
Your grandmother is from Yecheon, so she likes apples?
that's right
Gyeongbuk is famous for apples.
Kiki, is there a place you would recommend for a trip to Yecheon?
Hoeryongpo village in Yecheon is good
Hoerongpo Village?
Why is it famous there?
You can see the Nakdong River flowing
Nakdong River? I've never seen it!
That's a huge connection
I see
How many hours does it take to get from Seoul to Yecheon?
I think it took about 3 hours
Wow, it's further than I thought?
Is it a place lower than Nonsan?
Then it's Gyeongbuk, a little further away
Oh, I should go there when I'm in Nonsan~!
Yeah, it takes two and a half hours from Nonsan.
Huh? It takes 3 hours from Seoul, but it takes 2 and a half hours from Nonsan?
Yes, in Seoul, you drive on the highway, and in Nonsan, you drive on the national road.
Mom, is it really cold there now?
Yeah, I turned on the boiler.
I went out wearing slippers earlier and got in trouble!
They said it'll be colder tomorrow~
Dress warmly!
Oh my gosh ㅜㅜ I guess I shouldn't go out at all tomorrow!
By the way, do you have an electric blanket at home?
of course
My friend gave it to me as a birthday present~
Yeah, starting tomorrow, I have to turn it on and go to bed~
ㅜㅜ That's right
I like to sleep with the window open, so I have to sleep with it on!
But if you sleep with the doors open tomorrow, it'll be really cold
It's going to snow soon!
I see the weather is cloudy today
Yeah ㅜㅜ
Why did Grandma go out?
I went out to go hiking
I can't go now because it's cold
Yeah ㅜㅜ
My feet are still numb
Make sure to wear sleeping socks too haha
Little Mom, my heart doesn't hurt these days
I don't have time to get sick because I don't have anything.
Kiki, no, not that one, I mean chest pain, heart, huh,
Well, I'm not sure because you're so healthy~
These days, many people die from myocardial infarction accompanied by chest pain.
Isn't that because of the vaccine side effects?
Hmm~ I heard that there are many cases of sudden death from myocardial infarction even before getting vaccinated!
Well, myocardial infarction is dangerous
At what age does this usually happen?
Well, I guess it depends on age!
Is there any way to prevent this?
First of all, drink plenty of water and do some moderate exercise!
People these days don't exercise!
I'm already exercising a lot, so I need to drink a lot of water~
that's right
Drink 1.5 liters a day as a basic!
Oh man, I hate going to the bathroom so often ㅜㅜ
Does your mom like the Nike brand?
Yeah, but it's expensive so I don't buy it often
Me tooㅜ Do you know who the Nike representative is?
Well, I guess that's not common sense ㅜㅠ
I also found out from the article that Miller is a 72-year-old American!
At seventy-two, aren't you a grandfather?
Are you still alive?
Kiki, but this guy confessed to committing murder when he was a teenager!
What are you talking about when you say something like that?
I don't know, but before he took over as Nike's president, he was an executive at a food company and he didn't hide it then either!
So what are the reactions from other media outlets?
There's no such story, but I guess this guy published an autobiography this time!
You wrote something like that in your autobiography
Why did you commit a crime?
Yeah, that's right. I wrote it in detail there, but it basically said that he was taking revenge on the person who shot and killed his friend!
But murder should not be justified
That's bad
Oh, but I found out that the person this chairman killed was someone who had no relation to the death of his friend!
He shot and killed an innocent man.
I deserve to be punished
Have you ever had a lip tattoo, Mom?
No, I can't do it because my mouth is often open
So, is your tattoo only an eyeliner tattoo?
Yeah, that's right~ But I'm not good at that either
Does not doing it well mean you do not retouch it?
I've never done it once
It's ugly when erased
Kiki, how many years has it been since you did that?
It's been over two years
But doesn't that color turn gray?
No, it's not that good because it's too turquoise
Kiki, really? My eyebrow tattoo is turning red right now!
I'll have to do it again soon
How long has it been?
I think it's been about 3 years for me too!
Then go and get it quickly~
Kiki: Ah, but this hurts too much, I can't do it anymore!
But you have to do it anyways, it's pretty
Does your grandmother have a lot of dandruff?
Yeah, that's right, it's dry~
Kiki: Why do I have dandruff even though I have oily skin?
You have oily skin and your scalp is getting flaky?
Oh, is it because I don't wash well?
Or you might want to try changing your shampoo
I'm currently using a scalp shampoo, but it's not working.
Try Klorane Cooling Shampoo, it's really good. My daughter said.
Kiki cooling?
How much does that cost?
It was on sale at Olive Young so I didn't even spend 10,000 won, but they say it's good for the scalp
Is that a mildly acidic shampoo?
Is it good?
It seems like that, the ingredients are good and the shampoo is concentrated so I like it
I'm using scalp shampoo right now, so I think I should switch to that!
Yeah, try it out when you come over to my house later~
Kiki, I understand
How many liters is that?
They said it was 500 ml
Somehow he used it sparingly
Does your mom often use the post office for shopping?
I ordered a large quantity of seaweed before.
Kim? Kim, our dad is the captain?
The Gwangmyeon seaweed was delicious, so I always order that.
Kiki, that's right, we have a lot of Kim Dae-jangs in our house!
My last name is *, but everyone else looks like *
Kiki: Right. Then what kind of cards do you usually use?
I use my check card a lot these days~
The benefits are good
I heard that KakaoTalk check cards are good these days. Which card company do you use, Mom?
Yeah, my little dad uses the Kakao Pay card~ I use Nonghyup!
Little Daddy, do you know how to use Kakao Pay?
Kiki, I heard you received the subsidy through Kakao Pay last time
Oh my gosh Kiki
Are you completely modern?
That's what I'm saying
So I ordered a Ryan card
Kiki: These days, even Chunshik's cards are cute!
What kind of character is Chunsik?
Didn't your grandmother say she liked trot singers?
Yeah, that's right, I like Youngwoong the best
So did you go to the concert last year?
no
It hasn't been long since I saw you. I've been busy with work.
Then, do you still listen to Youngwoong’s songs on YouTube often these days?
Then, these days, I see a lot of people calling me Love Call Center.
Kiki, but do those people still appear on TV often these days?
Yeah, I think so
I think I'll have another audition soon
Are you saying that another Trot genre audition is starting?
I'll do a trot series Kiki
But Lim Young-woong was so successful
Kiki, right? Kiki, there's Im Young-woong and a female trot singer too!
Song Ga-in was buried instead...
Kiki, really?
But isn't Song Ga-in still famous?
But it was all buried because of Lim Young-woong.
Kiki But when I went to Pyeongtaek, there was a huge fan of Lim Young-woong in a cafe who had put up a lot of placards and pictures of him!
Mothers' love is truly amazing Kiki
Grandma, what kind of cartoons did you watch when you were young?
There's a really old one called Future Boy Conan
Kiki, my dad said he watched Dragon Ball!
Yeah, there was Galaxy Express 999 too.
Ah Kiki, goosebumps, I saw that on IBS
You saw that cartoon?
Oh, they aired that when I was little!
Wow. I don't even remember the content now.
Kiki: I also only remember the girl with long, yellow hair next to Tetsurou!
It's been so long since I've been like that, what comics are popular these days?
Right Kiki, these days, you wouldn't know even if I told you about your grandmother?
Yeah? Our kids have seen a lot of Shinchan.
Shinchan? My sister keeps watching that while eating too. Kiki
I think I still see it now
Oh my, how old are you?
Why can I see all of that!
So I think that's why I couldn't see it when I was young
Do you like eating late at night?
Of course I like it
For dinner, it's chicken
Kiki, so I'm going to order chicken now!
Chicken is good. Where should I order it?
I'm thinking about BBQ and Pelicana right now!
Today is BBQ
I recommend BBQ
Is Kiki BBQ Golden Olive the truth?
Yeah, that's the original standard.
Kiki A admits
Oh, but should I just eat the chicken legs or the whole thing?
I like one bone
Kiki, which part of chicken is your favorite?
I like the neck and wings
You like eating bones too, right?
Of course, chicken tastes good when you peel the bones
Me too Kiki
I like the rib part of Kiki Kiki
It's perfect for the two of us to eat together
Do you have your own room?
Of course, it's been there since I was little
Then how do you clean your room?
I'm the type that does it all at once
Mom, you don't touch the room?
Yeah, he stopped doing that when he became an adult.
okay?
I still have my mom cleaning up haha
i envy you
That's convenient though
No, it's Kiki
But sometimes my stuff disappears,
Oh right so I do it
The ring I recently bought disappeared after my mom cleaned it.
Hmm, did you throw it away?
I wish I could find it
Yeah ㅜㅜ But I don't think I can find it ㅜㅜ
really?
You don't even know where your mother is?
No, I think my mom sucked it up with a vacuum cleaner!
Then I guess I can't find it...
Did you take the train to college?
Yes, I took the train and the bus.
Wow, wouldn't it be better to live in a dorm?
It was so hard that I lived in a dormitory
So is the dorm better and commuting to and from school better?
The dorm is comfortable, but I miss home cooking
Kiki, that's right
How many hours did it take from home to school?
I think it took about an hour
But it doesn't take as long as you think to take the train or bus, right?
Yes, it takes 15 minutes by train.
Oh really?
Is it only one stop?
Yeah, that's right, it's a nearby area
Kiki, thank goodness
What time do you usually catch the train?
I don't always have much time, so I went early in the morning.
Oh, I see ㅜㅜ
What time did you go in the morning?
I think we left around 7:30
Have you ever worked part-time anywhere other than your parents' store?
I've worked a little more than I've worked part-time
Aren't you young now?
When did you go?
Yeah, I went there for a bit this year to get some experience.
Were you hired as a full-time employee?
no
I think I learned a lot even though I was a contract worker
Is this a job that uses your major?
Yeah, I managed a kindergarten and daycare center called the Children's Meal Support Center.
Oh really?
Aren't the babies so cute?
Yes, the kids came and said, &quot;Teacher, you're pretty.&quot; You looked like an angel.
So you made food for the babies?
no
I planned and managed the diet for you.
Then is there someone else who makes it?
The chefs are separate and we trained them.
Oh, so you were the kitchen manager?
Yeah, I think it was fun
Have you seen any military-related articles lately?
no
I'm not interested in the military
So, have you heard about the recent incident where a female Air Force sergeant committed suicide?
Oh, I think I heard that a little bit
It was a huge issue this summer, wasn't it?
Oh really?
What's going on?
He sexually harassed and assaulted a female sergeant ㅜㅜ
Wow, right? T_T
Oh really?
That kind of thing happens in the military too
Yeah, I think this kind of thing happens a lot ㅜㅜ
The law should be changed so that things like this don't happen.
So the perpetrator was also a sergeant!
I really couldn't stand it because my colleagues did too much.
Oh, now that I look at it, it was your boss!
He's the one above!
If it was my boss, I wouldn't have been able to resist at all.
So, that's why he wrote a will and committed suicide.
It's so sad.
This kind of thing should stop happening
What qualifications do you have now?
I have a nutritionist license.
Nutritionist license?
Isn't that a national qualification?
Yes, I studied for a long time to pass.
Your parents will really like this!?
right?
Yes, it's on display in the living room.
Wow lol Kiki, are you giving me a certificate like that?
Well, they don't give it to everyone who passes
So even if you pass, you only give it to those who are chosen?
I have to go to the hospital and get tested and send them the documents.
Oh really? Kiki
amazing
What other certifications do you have besides that?
I think I failed the computer certification exam a few times.
Kiki, are you talking about the level 2 computer skills?
Yeah, other people say it's easy, but it's not for me.
No~
That was seriously the hardest certification exam ever!
Right, why do you keep raising the cutoff line?
How many people did you say are in your family?
Well, there are 5 people in my family.
Did you say that you have your parents, an older sister, and a younger sister?
no
I have an older brother and a younger brother
Oh right Kiki
You said your brother was 25 years old, right?
Yes, my younger brother is a year younger than me.
Oh really?
So you're 21 now?
Yes, I'm in college
Where did Kiki's little sister go to college?
Well, my brother went to Japan.
Wow, they've all spread out into the world, huh?
That's right, everyone went in search of their dreams
Kiki, what was your major that you went to?
My younger brother is majoring in architecture.
Wow, I heard that if you want to be an architect, you have to be really good at math?
Yeah, I'm having a hard time with math homework.
Is your brother with his girlfriend in Australia?
I don't know, don't tell me
Do you talk to your brother often?
I don't do it, but my parents do it often.
Oh, right, Kiki
What do you want to do first when you get a boyfriend?
When I get a boyfriend, I want to go to an amusement park.
Kiki, really?
Everland school uniform dates are trendy these days!
That's why I really want to try it
I need to get a boyfriend quickly
That's right, when you feel lonely, you need to start dating quickly!
I should ask my friends to do some housework for me.
Oh good
Are there a lot of good kids around you?
My female friends had a lot of trouble when it came to men.
Kiki but I admit that
If the two break up on bad terms, only the person in the middle will be in trouble!
So I can't really talk to my friends
I admit that,
I've been there too,
Still, I want to get a boyfriend and go to the amusement park
Did you say the names of your puppies at home are Hwiji and Kamji?
Yeah, that's right. The name fits the face perfectly.
Kiki I miss you guys Kiki
What kind of snacks do you usually give your kids?
I'm giving you dried duck
So you're giving the kids homemade snacks?
These days, there are a lot of homemade snacks being sold on the Internet.
I'm also trying to learn how to make homemade dog treats~
Well, wouldn't it be very difficult?
Why? Are homemade snacks not popular these days?
Even if you make it in bulk, it gets smaller when you dry it.
Oh right Kiki
But I'm going to join the startup class and learn about other snacks!
If I make a snack, you'll give it to me too, right?
Of course~
I'll make you some tissues and snacks!
I think the kids will like it a lot
Kiki: Then~ I'll make cakes for the kids' birthdays too!
really?
I think the kids will really like it
Have you ever done pilates?
no
I haven't tried it, but I want to try it
Me too ㅜㅜ
But to do that, you need to have some basic flexibility, right?
I guess so. If you don't have flexibility, it's going to be very difficult.
Kiki, right? Do you have any core strength?
I don't know, I don't exercise much
Pilates requires better core strength than flexibility!
They say that Pilates is only effective if you do it consistently for a long time?
Yeah, I'm basically only going to try it for 3 months!
Please tell me your review after going for 3 months.
Kiki Oki Okay
But I have to buy a piltebok, so why do I have to wear this?
Isn't that because there's friction between the equipment and your skin?
Is that so?
The place I'm going to is a place that only uses props, hmm
Then, is there really no need to buy it?
But when I went to ask, they told me to come wearing a uniform!
Then are you going to buy it?
There are a lot of pretty things these days
So did you play with air a lot when you were little?
Of course I tried it
I did really well among my friends
But did you have a rule called the cross back then?
What is a cross?
Is this your first time hearing about it?
right?
Kids living in Suwon have a rule called the cross!
This is my first time hearing about it
I guess it varies from region to region
Me too Kiki
This is a deal where if you draw a cross in step 2, you pass step 2!
Oh, that's amazing. This is my first time hearing about it.
Me too Kiki
How well did you play with air?
I've always been first
I really liked it
Kiki, if I bet 100 points, I'll be the first to get 100 points!
Oh, I guess you did really well
Let's do it with me too
Oh good!
These days, old games have become popular because of Ogames!
So, thanks to Ogame, foreigners also know about it.
That's right Kiki, when I see Ogame 2 coming out, I'll definitely go play air!
That's right, how many fun scenes would come out of playing with air?
Where did you go early this year?
I think I went to Jeju Island early this year
Wow~ Who did you go there with?
I went with my parents
It was really pretty
Wow ㅜㅜ You must have seen camellia flowers for the first time?
Yes, the camellia flowers were in full bloom and beautiful.
I'm also planning to go early next year. Can you recommend some courses?
Then I recommend going to Udo.
Oh, I heard there are a lot of electric bicycles in Udo?
Yeah, it would be nice to ride that around
Kiki, how many hours did you ride that?
I think I rode for about an hour or two
Can you go around Udo Island in two hours?
I think so, but it was a bit difficult
Kiki, what's the big deal when you don't even pedal a bike!
It was very tiring to go sightseeing
You said you went to Jeju Island, right?
How was the weather?
It was nice but it was too windy
Is it windy there because it's an island?
That's right, the wind blows more if you go towards the sea.
Kiki: Then you must have packed an outer garment?
of course
My ears were so cold because of the wind.
Kiki, was it so windy that your ears started to hurt?
It blew a lot
But eating raw fish in the cold is still delicious
Ah, I want to eat raw fish too
What month exactly did you go there?
I went in February
So it must have been very windy
Oh, I'm planning to go in February too. Do I need to bring a padded jacket?
Padding is a must, I recommend long padding
If you wear Kiki's padding, you won't be able to wear pretty Kokka clothes!?
I wore it inside the padding and took it off slightly only when taking pictures.
Kiki, I guess so
Would it be possible to wear a skirt?
Go fully armed with a skirt and long padding
Wow, I heard there was a case of sexual assault of a teenage girl at the hospital this time!
How dare they do that to a baby in a hospital
Isn't this awesome?
He's only 10 years old!
Oh really? He's so young?
So, do you know what kind of person the perpetrator is?
Who is it? Is it someone you know?
No, I'm a man in my 60s.
Isn't he totally a grandfather?
Why did grandpa do that?
So, he was even in the same hospital room!
Wow, how hard must that kid have had a hard day
So, he said that if I took her to the bathroom and touched her private parts, he would buy me ramen!
How do you say that to a baby?
So, he said he would buy me some delicious ramen to keep my mouth shut.
I tried to solve everything with ramen, it was really bad
So, he said he changed his hospital room because he knew this.
Is it over if I just change hospital rooms?
So I hope he gets punished properly and apologizes.
Do you know where Lebanon is?
No, this is my first time hearing about it. Where is it?
This is an Arab country, and there was a shooting incident and it's causing chaos!
Why? So many people died?
They say it happened because of religious conflict in an area where Christians and Muslims live!
Really? If we both just give in a little bit, why are we like that?
Oh my, this started so suddenly that a lot of people died ㅜㅜ
What crime did the injured and dead people commit? It was too much.
A total of 6 people died and dozens were injured.
Is religion more important than people?
Arab countries are countries where religion is more important.
Yeah, that's right, it's been famous since long ago...
Wow, now that I look at it, there was a shooting incident like this 30 years ago too!
So, were there many sacrifices made 30 years ago as well?
I guess so
ㅜㅜ What is that religion!
We just need to give in to each other a little bit
Have you ever tried eyelash ampoules?
Of course I tried it and it worked well
Oh really?
Where have you tried it?
I don't know the name, but I tried a famous one
I'm using Etude products right now?
how is it?
Does Etude have a good effect?
Oh my, my eyelashes have grown so long!
How about the price?
Is it good value for money?
I bought this for 20,000 won on OnePlus One
you?
I bought it for over 30,000 won at Tuplus One.
If it's 2 plus 1, you used all 3 by yourself?
no
My mom gave me one
The effect was good
Kiki, I see
My eyelashes are drooping now so I'm thinking about getting a perm!
If you perm it, a lot of hair falls out
Oh really?
Are my eyelashes falling out?
Okay, so I recommend using an ampoule.
Did you say you had gastritis this time?
Yeah, that's right, it hurts so much
Since when did you start feeling sick?
I think it's been about a week
But it's been two weeks and you still feel pain?
Yeah, I went to the hospital late and took my medicine late.
Oh my gosh, it's become chronic?
I hope not, but I guess so
Oh my gosh ㅜㅜ Then you should never eat apples or bananas on an empty stomach!
Bananas are delicious when eaten on an empty stomach.
No, there is iron in it and that is not good for an empty stomach!
Oh really?
From now on, I won't eat bananas on an empty stomach.
Kiki Yeah yeah I thought I was going to die after eating an apple on an empty stomach last time!
Why? Are you feeling sick?
There's acid in apples!
That's really bad for an empty stomach!
Then I guess I should eat something else before eating the apple.
Have you ever done anything like carrot trading?
no
I haven't tried it because I'm afraid there will be a lot of scams.
Oh, I see ㅜㅜ
So you only use new products and not used ones?
Yeah, but if you look at the reviews on the internet, there are a lot of good reviews.
Have you bought anything from an online shopping mall recently?
Yeah, I bought some clothes as fall came.
Kiki, you must buy a trench coat, right?
Of course, a trench coat is a must in fall.
Kiki, that's right, I bought it in advance and hung it next to you!
I feel like if I go outside everyone will be wearing them like twins
Kiki I bought it in blue, not brown!
really?
How much did you pay for it?
Guess how much I paid for it~
Hmm, fifty thousand won?
There are a lot of cheap ones these days
Kiki is correct~
I bought it for exactly 48,000 won!
you?
I bought it for cheap, 35,000 won
Do you have a favorite celebrity these days?
I'm really into Monsta X these days
Monsta X?
It's a boy idol group, right?
Yeah, that's right, Shownu and Jooheon are the most famous
Ah, I think I know a friend named Jooheon!
The face is babyish, but the body is manly
Kiki, isn't that friend the one with long, slanted eyes and no double eyelids?
Yeah, that's right, the charm is incomparable
Kiki Oh yeah, I saw that guy in the prequel!
Yeah, isn't it so cute?
Oh, Kiki, you eat really well too!
Yes, meat side dish for breakfast is amazing
Oh right, but I'm jealous that you don't gain weight.
You must exercise a lot because your body is full of muscles
Kiki: But since you're an idol, your level of activity is different from that of ordinary people!
Yeah, the face is cute, but I really like the body that doesn't have that kind of body.
What genre of movies do you like?
I like horror movies the best.
Oh really? Then have you seen that horror movie that came out recently?
I think I've seen almost all the horror movies
Oh really?
Have you seen Langzhong?
Of course I ran to see it as soon as it was released
Who did you watch it with?
I saw it with my friends
The kids were watching with their eyes closed
Kiki, I also watched the end with my eyes closed,
I'm not that scared of Langzong
The actors just did a great job
You're a bit of a pervert, aren't you?
That's not scary, is it?
I guess I've become resistant to horror movies because I watch them so much.
Kiki Huh, then what's the scariest horror movie you've ever seen?
I don't think so
I can't see anything more cruel than a ghost
Then you won't be able to see the teacher's grace!
Yeah, I didn't watch it because it was said to be cruel.
Is there any food you don't like, oppa?
I don't think there's anything I dislike or particularly dislike about Kiki
Really? I have just one!
What aren't you eating?
I absolutely hate all types of mushrooms!
Wow, how can you not eat mushrooms?
But there are several kinds you can eat!
What is that Kiki? Then you're not not eating it?
Eat mushrooms, tops, and cordyceps!
Huh? What kind of mushroom is Dongchunghwacho? Kiki
Kiki, there's that golden mushroom that looks like a oyster mushroom!
Oh, you mean the brown one that looks a bit dirty?
Yeah, that's right. Of all the mushrooms, I don't even like shiitake mushrooms!
Kiki, what makes that mushroom different from the other ones?
The scent of the perilla leaves is so strong~
Then I guess we can't go eat shabu-shabu together, Kiki
Are you using a diffuser right now?
Is there any house these days that doesn't have a diffuser?
That's right, a man like you who lives alone is a must!
That's right, when kids come over to play, it smells. So I have to use Kiki.
Yes, I went to a friend's house last time, and the male scent was no joke.
I don't know, but people say so Kiki
Kiki, that's right. When a man lives alone, he has that special smell!
Is it only men who can't feel that? Kiki
Kiki I think so
So I threw a diffuser as a housewarming gift to my brother.
But if you give it to him like that, won't he be a little like that too? Kiki
Kiki, you like the scent, don't you? Kiki
Oh, that guy is a bit open
I think I'll be depressed if I get it Kiki
Kiki, why Kiki, you can't help it because of your hormone secretion
Well, that's true ㅠㅠ
What can I do? I have to clean well.
Yeah Kiki but I don't think it's me oppa so that's a relief!
I really care a lot, Kiki
Have you ever been on a boat, oppa?
No I've never been on a boat Kiki
Really? Didn't you ride it when you went to Jeju Island?
Oh for a moment I thought you were talking about a fishing boat Kiki
And we used to ride on a chubby boat too
When did we last ride the tummy tummy?
When our company went on a trip to Jeju Island, Kiki
Oh, back then? Was that a chubby belly?
Wasn't that a yacht?
You rode a yacht and a boat too!
Didn't I get a chubby belly?
I don't remember at all
Oppa, open your old photo album quickly, Kiki
I changed my phone so I don't have any pictures right now Kiki
Okay Kiki, my phone went bad too and everything disappeared ㅜ
Oh my, that would be a shame
I still transferred everything to my laptop Kiki
Kiki, really? Then let's quickly find the one we rode on!
Hey, this is different from the cell phone so it's hard to find Kiki
What are you going to do when you quit your job?
I think I'll have a lot of money once I retire Kiki
Kiki, that's right, oppa, your savings are no joke, right?
I'm gritting my teeth right now
So when that happens, I will definitely buy a building.
Kiki, really?
So, oppa, your ultimate dream is to become a building owner?
But these days, buildings are not that great either, so I need to know that before investing. Kiki
Where is the best place to invest these days?
Well, when I look at people, they do it in so many different ways. I'll have to listen to some of them and try them out. Kiki
How's the solar business these days?
That's been dead for a long time, Kiki
It's too late now.
Kiki, what about the people who invested there?
Those who invested before are okay because the contract is for 20 years.
Oh, I see. Kiki. Then when are you going to retire, oppa?
But I have to keep working, Kiki
I guess I'll have to run until I'm 50, Kiki
Did you say you were going to bury your bones there? Kiki
I plan to keep going unless something big comes up.
Brother, where did you go from the Army, Navy, and Air Force?
I'm from the army Kiki
Kiki Army Kiki I know someone who is a career soldier in the Air Force!
Oh, that's cool?
How about that?
But not all air forces fly!
Why? If you're in the Air Force, aren't you supposed to fly and parachute and stuff?
No, there are soldiers who fix fighter planes too!
Oh, so he's an engineer?
Oh, that's right, my brother is in the Air Force and he's working in a role like an engineer!
Oh, then you would have gone into engineering even if you weren't in the Air Force Kiki
Kiki, that's right, when you retire there, you'll go to the airport!
Oh, so you're going to be an airport flight engineer?
Oh, that's right. I heard that your career is recognized even if you are a career soldier!
Oh well, it went in well, good job Kiki
Oh, that's right! I heard you studied really hard to get in!
As expected, hard work never betrays Kiki
Oppa, don't you plan on learning drums?
Oh, my aunt sent me a video of her playing drums recently. Kiki
Does your aunt like playing drums? Kiki
Yeah, it looks like you're having a hobby right now, Kiki
Wow, really? If you're a woman, don't you like things like the piano more than the drums?
No, you're building a new house right now and you put a drum in there. Kiki
Wow, those drums must be really expensive!?
So now he's embezzling money without telling his uncle.
Kiki Hull Will Aunt Kiki's dream come true?
He's sending me money, and he's going to call me and ask me to buy him one when he moves, so he's going to buy me one Kiki
Wow, Kiki, how much are you depositing to your brother?
The amount I send every day is different. I'm still collecting Kiki
So how much does a drum cost?
I don't know about that either, Kiki
Wouldn't it be different for each type? Haha
But I guess it'll cost at least a few hundred?
I think so Kiki
It's a stretch to say that I gave a thousand units as a gift.
Does your brother live with his grandparents?
No, they weren't there when I was little ㅠㅠ
I see. They all returned early?
Yeah, so I don't remember the face very well either.
My grandfather passed away when I was 20 years old.
Oh, your parents must have had a hard time ㅠㅠ
Yeah, my grandfather and my parents did it all.
Wow, your mom must have had a really hard time ㅠㅠ
That's right, we take turns peeing and pooping together.
Did you help your mother too?
Of course, my sister and I were stuck at home!
Still, I bet you got a lot of help from your mom. Kiki, you did a good job!
Yeah ㅜㅜ My grandfather was doing well, but then he suddenly got sick ㅜ
Originally, it seemed like all illnesses came suddenly ㅠㅠ
Mud mud ㅜㅜ So my grandfather didn't smoke or drink, so he was healthy!
Rather, people who do that are healthier Kiki
Oppa, why did you break up with your ex-girlfriend?
I didn't really know the value of dogs back then, Kiki
Really? Do you think you understand now?
No, now that I think about it, I think I may have been a bit too much.
Why? You didn't express your love to me well?
No, I was so annoyed that I had to fix my makeup in the car when I got there.
Why does that bother you?
Are you trying to look pretty!?
I had to go in, but I had to wait, and it was delayed, and it was annoying.
Wow ㅜㅜ Are you a bit impatient?
It's not urgent, but it's annoying because you do it all the time, Kiki
Oh my gosh ㅜㅜ Of course, when you wear a mask, your makeup comes off, so it can't be helped ㅜ
Kiki said it wasn't corona at that time
Kiki: Oh, so it's really been almost two years since you broke up with your ex-girlfriend?
Yeah, it's been a long time since I broke up with the dog, Kiki.
Kiki, if we were dating now, you wouldn't be upset about it, right?
Ah, then I will definitely wait and buy you cosmetics Kiki
Oppa said he was bringing a cat!
Oh right, I'm preparing to bring a cat this time
Are cats male or female? Do you know?
I don't know that either, Kiki
I'm receiving a child sent by a friend.
Then you're saying you'll send him after neutering?
There was no such thing
Shouldn't I do it while raising them?
Probably females should do it when they are 3-4 months old!
Oh, you can't do it when the kids grow up?
No, but more than that, the kids are suffering!
That's what you have to do when you're a baby who doesn't know anything.
That's right ㅜㅜ The stray cats outside are crying!
That's why it's such a painful deal!
Oh my, are you crying because you're in so much pain?
Since I can't erupt, it's okay once I combine them.
When stray cats cry outside, isn't it because they're hungry and not because they're being neutered?
If they're hungry, they'll hunt, right?
Ah, I'm going hunting, Kiki.
I thought you were crying because you were hungry
Honey, do you have any plans to learn golf?
I don't have time yet, but a lot of my friends are doing it, so I'm going to try it later.
Right? These days, a lot of young people are learning golf!
Yeah, everyone around me was playing golf, Kiki.
Wow, they said that the common people couldn't live, but that's all a lie!
But Kiki says you should definitely learn golf
Then it'll all be over
But I don't know how that works!
There is also a rumor that when you play golf, only one side of your body develops.
So anyway, it only hits one side!
Aren't all sports that involve holding a racket like this?
Oh, that's right. In badminton, only one side of the trapezius muscle is developed!
Kiki looks like he's very muscular when it comes to table tennis and hitting.
Kiki, that's right, tennis is no joke!
Oh, that racket is really heavy and the ball is big.
Kiki is right and it hurts a lot when you get hit with it
If I do that, I'll practice doing it with both hands Kiki
Have you ever been to a casino, oppa?
No, I've never been there
Don't you want to go?
I want to go!
When you say casino, you mean Kangwon Land, right?
Gangwon Land and Las Vegas casinos are famous too~
But then again, I can't go to Kiki because I'm afraid I won't be able to get out if I fall
That's right Kiki, I'll get out of here with my mental strength!
And I'm scared of what might happen Kiki
Kiki That's true, but life is one shot!
I went and hit the jackpot, but people are blocking me from leaving. I'm scared. Kiki
Hey, that won't be the case, then it's all ruined already~
I'm going to go once in a while just out of curiosity, but how much is appropriate to bring?
Well, a regular casino costs about 200,000 won just to have fun?
I thought I would lose everything so I went to Kiki
That's right Kiki, just think of it as the cost of enjoying the game and take it!
This is exactly what they call a fun time. Kiki, it'll be fun.
Have you ever stayed in a hotel, oppa?
Yeah, of course I've been there when I went out to play, Kiki
But what's the difference between a hotel and a motel?
It's small, big, clean, and has a lot of facilities.
As far as I know, hotels allow food in the room?
Yeah? If you deliver to a motel, food will come in. Kiki
No~ There is a hotel-only restaurant~ Room service~
Yeah, I think the difference is that there are a lot of those facilities, Kiki.
Oh, come to think of it, the hotel has a gym and a swimming pool?
Yeah, that's right, it looks like there are a lot of fun things to do, Kiki
That's right, and the prices of hotels and motels also differ a lot!
So people go to hotels and have a staycation.
Kiki, that's right, I want to enjoy a staycation too!
I haven't been on a vacation yet either ㅠㅠ
When is the best time to go on a vacation to enjoy it the most?
But I think it's always peak time to go in the summer Kiki
Isn't it really cold today?
I feel like I'm freezing to death
Yes, it's so cold today, the wind is blowing into the house too.
Did it rain there yesterday too?
Yeah, that's right. It rained yesterday so it's cold today.
Kiki: So, after it rained, the temperature dropped a lot!
Now that fall is really here, it seems like it's going to get colder Kiki
That's right. Starting Monday, I'll definitely have to bring a coat with me to work!
I already have a coat in the office Kiki
Kiki I have a sweatshirt too, but I need to get a windbreaker for commuting!
Kiki, I think you should always keep an outer garment in the car.
Right, I need to buy my boyfriend some outerwear this time!
My dad came in just now and is making a fuss saying it's cold.
Kiki, daebak Kiki, I should peel a tangerine in this weather!
You said it's a cold wave, so you're getting ready to wash up now
Kiki Hul Kiki Of course, the water you wash in is warm water, right?
Of course, you need to wash it warmly to feel refreshed~
This time, a man in his 20s ran away in handcuffs!
Wow, even if you run away like that, you won't be able to do anything?
That's right, and the bold one is that he cut the handcuffs with a cutter and escaped!
Wow, where did you get that cutter?
This guy was waiting outside and he gave her a cutter!
Oh, there was an accomplice?
Wow, what did you do to get caught?
Oh, that's right. He got caught for drunk driving and went to the police station!
But for drunk driving, you just have to go and get investigated and pay a fine, but do you really have to go that far?
So, at that moment, I was so scared that I told my friend and asked him for help!
The friend who helped me with that was the same, Kiki Kiri Kiri, as they say...
I think Kiki's friend will be punished when I see him!
Yeah, you shouldn't help people like that so easily, but I guess you did that when you were young.
But he ran away like that in the morning and turned himself in in the evening.
Yeah, he ran away, but I guess he realized it wasn't right after time passed, Kiki
Kiki: So you kept going around Hwasan and Ansan, but it didn't work out, so you turned yourself in.
Still, I guess he must have sobered up before he went in, Kiki
Did you know that volcanic eruption happened in Spain last time?
Oh, there was a volcano erupting on the mountain over there?
Yeah, there was a volcanic eruption on the island of La Palma in Spain!
La Palma Island? Is that a famous island in Spain?
Yeah, I think so
But I heard there are dogs stranded on this island.
Oh, so you rescued those puppies?
They couldn't rescue them, so instead they dropped food from the sky using a drone!
But if there was a volcanic eruption, didn't the kids get caught in it too?
Right? Some puppies died and there were still some left, right?
I don't think food is the problem, but I think treatment is more urgent ㅠㅠ
But I guess the ground is too hot right now to land ㅜ
Oh, then shouldn't I spray water on it first to cool it down?
I guess so? Maybe they sprinkled some feed after that?
I hope this is resolved quickly so that he can be rescued and treated ㅠㅠ
So, if you look at the video, the kids are eating the food voraciously.
I hope we don't get into fights while eating
Oppa, do you pack your bag when you go to work?
No, I just packed a bag to change clothes in.
So you just pack your clothes and go to work?
Yeah, that's right. When you work hard, you get sweaty sometimes, so you have to change your clothes. Kiki
I see. So you're carrying a crossbody bag?
No, just a suitcase? You carry that around Kiki
These days, there are really convenient bags that can hold clothes from places like Nike or Adidas.
But I think it would be a waste to use something like that for work.
Why? That's what you buy for!
Kiki, I just keep it in my bag and use it.
Kiki: Okay, okay. Then it would be a bag worth about 5,000 won?
I don't know the price, I just brought it from the house Kiki
Kiki: I see. What kind of clothes do you usually pack?
When you go out, just wear your work clothes and change into comfortable sweatpants!
I see. You don't pack separate underwear?
Ah, don't pack that separately. Wash and change at home. Kiki
Has your brother ever been hospitalized?
No, I've had the best stamina since I was little, Kiki
Oh really? I was recently hospitalized~
You? When were you admitted and why?
I was hospitalized with enteritis~
Oh, there are a lot of people who get enteritis
But does that mean you have to be hospitalized?
Yeah, that's right. They say it's better to be hospitalized to get better quickly.
If you're hospitalized, aren't you fasting for enteritis?
Give me white porridge instead of fasting! It's tasteless.
Oh, but you still eat?
Fasting really sucks, Kiki
Kiki, that's right. If it's severe, it's called fasting, but if you eat again, you'll feel like throwing up~
But I have to fast again, and if I eat it, it's going to be a mess, and Kiki's going to get sick
Oh yeah, my stomach kept rumbling!
Still, it's a good thing you're not like that, Kiki
Yeah, so when you get a ringel, it works right away?
Ah, but I'm glad it worked, Kiki
Oppa, have you ever used Timon?
I used to do it a lot in my early 20s Kiki
I also bought a water park ticket from Timon!
Oh, there were a lot of people buying tickets there Kiki
Kiki is right but I got a refund,
Kiki, why can't I go there and get a refund?
Oh, I have a friend who works at a water park, and the day we went there, an elementary school kid pooped there!
Oh, then I don't want to play again. I feel bad because I can't go Kiki.
Yeah, and you know what, the water park is just a place to salvage stuff?
Right, they say they just disinfect it there, Kiki
Kiki: That's right, I have sensitive skin so I can't go to places like that!
I think it would be better to go to a valley instead of just a water park or something Kiki
That's right, Kiki Valley is a parasite yum yum~
Kiki: So in the end, you can't go anywhere?
Kiki No, parasites are a good source of protein for our bodies.
Are you sure? I wonder if parasites will take over later. Kiki
Oppa, have you ever been to a celebrity concert and had fun?
No, not yet, but I want to go to the Psy concert Kiki
Wow, I went to a Psy concert!
Oh, so you went to the Drenched Show too?
No, I've been to an all night stand concert!
What is that?
I've only heard of the drenched show Kiki
This show goes on until morning!
Wow, how long is the concert?
I think it took 5 hours if I remember correctly!
If it's until morning, does that mean the time to enter there is dawn?
No, they start at 11 and send you when you can catch the first train Kiki
Wow, that guy Psy has incredible stamina, Kiki
I almost cried at the end,
I wanted to go home,
Is it too hard?
But I probably couldn't go because I didn't have a car.
At the end, Psy sprinkled water, but I thought it was really rain!
Wow, daebak Kiki, you should have taken a bite of that Kiki
Have you ever been to a drive-in theater with your girlfriend?
Yeah, I've been there once or twice Kiki
Isn't it better there than a regular movie theater?
No, I like regular movie theaters better Kiki
Really? I have a sore throat so movie theaters are uncomfortable for me!
If you don't reserve a seat at a drive-in theater, you'll be worried about the people around you.
That's right, you absolutely have to take the SUV!
So, considering the view and all that, I think the movie theater is better.
And if you keep it on in front, it's really annoying!
Don't people walk around telling you to turn it off?
Besides that light, there are lights inside the car!
Oh right, that's right. If you don't know how to turn it off, it's annoying to watch.
That's right, just pull the side brake!
Yeah, some people explain it to you, some don't. Kiki
Yeah Kiki, that's totally a testament to that!
So I think it was really uncomfortable when I first went there, Kiki
Sister, what did you eat for lunch?
I ate dakgalbi today
Oh really, I ate ribs too~ Pork ribs~
Ah, Chuncheon Dakgalbi is so delicious
Kiki, it's been so long since I ate Chuncheon Dakgalbi!
It's been a long time since I've had it, so it's really delicious
Are you sure there are sweet potatoes in there too?
Yeah, that's right, it's really delicious
Kiki, oh my gosh, I want to eat that too
Is there rice cake in it too?
Add rice cake and ramen noodles
Wow, this is crazy! Ramen noodles are the truth!
Ramen noodles topped with real cheese
Kiki, you eat fried rice there too?
Yeah, I'll make two fried rices and some cider
I'm so jealous Kiki, come eat with me next time!
Then whenever you want, just say Kiki, let's go
Sister, I think it's time to get rid of the long board now.
Yeah, the weather is so cold ㅠㅠ
Kiki, I went out for a bit and came back and I froze to death.
I'm thinking about what padding to buy
Kiki Oh really? But isn't it too early to wear padding?
Is the padding oversized? Haha
I'm so cold
Kiki, do you feel cold easily?
Yeah, I was born in winter, but I'm fine
Kiki Oh but I don't think that matters
I was born in January too!
Yeah, that's right. I was born in February too, and it's so cold.
Kiki, right? What brand of padding are you looking at?
I want a Moncler. Who wouldn't buy it for me?
Moncler? Isn't that an expensive brand?
Yeah, that's right. I can't afford it with my salary.
Kiki, how much does one of those cost?
It'll probably cost around 3 million won ㅠㅠ You beggar
Didn't you say you had a car?
Yeah, I'm here to play haha
Kiki, really? Where did you go to play?
I just came back from Iksan haha
Wow Kiki Iksan?
What are you doing there?
I'm eating with my boyfriend. Chicken galbi, yum yum
I'm jealous, you're eating in Iksan?
Yeah, I'm eating in Iksan, but where is the cafe?
Cafe? Is there a famous cafe in Iksan?
Dessert 369 is famous there.
Isn't that a brand?
How about going down a little further and going to a cafe in Jeonju?
Jeonju is nice. Can you recommend me a place to go?
Kiki: Isn't that cafe inside Jeonju Hanok Village famous?
Um where are you I only eat chicken skewers Kiki
Kiki, really? That Taegeuk Cafe? Oh, that's famous! ?
I'll go with my boyfriend sometime and find it haha
Sister, what kind of part-time job have you ever had?
I worked at a bar haha
If it's a bar, there are regulars, but aren't there also a lot of regulars?
There are regular customers, but there are too many real customers.
Right? ㅜㅜ I know because I work at a bar too!
Oh seriously, that's so hard
Yeah ㅜㅜ There was someone who just cursed at me,
You made me run an errand to buy cigarettes ㅠㅠ
Wow, smoking is a bit much, but I think I did it too!
And then he gave me 500 won. Kiki was so annoyed ㅠㅠ
Kiki, oh well, my sister at least gave me change, I gave her my card.
Kiki, I paid for the taxi with my change... Ah, card...
Kiki, wow, Kiki, what bar did you work at?
I worked at a beer house
I used to work part-time at a skewer restaurant!
Oh, you must have eaten a lot of skewers.
Sister, have you ever visited your friend?
Yeah, I've been there
Too far
Oh really? Where have you been?
Yeah, I went to Cheorwon, Gangwon-do.
Oh, I went to Cheorwon too, and it really made me want to swear.
Yeah, it was really hard, but it was still good.
Kiki, really? Were you close with a lot of friends?
Yeah, we've been friends since elementary school haha, my best friend
Kiki wow wow that would be awesome
What did you buy?
Bread, chicken, pizza, and cigarettes
Cigarettes? Kiki, can I bring that in?
Kiki said it was okay during the interview, so I bought it for her.
Oh, Kiki, I bought chicken and pizza. Kiki.
Yeah, chicken is really the best haha
Kiki, that's right, how many hours have you been here?
I'll have to buy it again in 2 hours haha
Sister, do you remember that there was a baduk academy when we were young?
I went to piano lessons but I don't know how to play baduk or kiki.
Kiki, I went to piano school too, but there was also a baduk school!
Oh, it's really funny, I think there was a game of baduk
Kiki That's right, but I don't think I've seen any places with baduk academies these days!
Yeah, I haven't seen it either. I guess kids these days don't do it.
So, only kids with really good brains do that!
No, you can do it too. Fighting!
Kiki, I wonder if it's okay for my head to be all stiff right now?
Kiki but I'm also frozen huh
Kiki, but I know how to play Go
I learned a little from my dad
Oh really? I learned it from the old man next door, but I forgot it all!
Oh really, I still remember it
Kiki: Well, I just know how to build a house!
I don't even remember ㅠㅠ
Did you create a family group room on KakaoTalk?
Yeah, I have a group chat with my mom, dad, and brother.
We made a room for all of our cousins!
Oh really, I should make one too
Kiki, I think it's okay!
I like chatting with you too!
I want to chat, but my cousins are too young ㅠㅠ
Oh, how old are your cousins now?
Baby, babies, 7 year old Kiki
Wow Kiki, you're so young Kiki
Yeah, he's too young to listen well.
Huh? There's a big age difference between you and my sister, but you won't listen to me?
Yeah, come on, tease me more ㅠ
Kiki, wow, you have to fix that right in the first place!
The real troublemakers are the ones who need to be caught
Kiki That's right, I also scold my cousins and correct their bad habits!
Oh, that's really cool, Kiki
I can't do it
How do you celebrate your anniversary with your boyfriend?
I like gifts and food dates haha
Hmm, did you celebrate your anniversary this year?
Yeah, I packed it up and went to cut the steak.
Oh I'm jealous Kiki
My anniversary is next week, what should I do?
Oh really then I recommend Outback
Ah Outback! But my boyfriend ate there recently at work!
Oh really ㅜㅜ Then pork belly is the best Kiki
Kiki's pork belly! Pork belly is good!
Soju with pork belly!
Samgyeopsal Kiki or galbi would be delicious
I ate Kiki's ribs today so I'll pass!
Oh, so what's the date?
I want to go on a date to Namsan Tower, but I don't know how to do it!
Go to Namsan Tower and lock the padlock.
Is there a place there where I can buy a lock and lock it?
I tried it with my boyfriend a long time ago
What kind of personality does your sister have?
Innocent, lively, kind and generous
Does Gaeul bark often?
No, I don't bark, never, except when the doorbell rings.
Wow, wow, what a gentle kid!
Very docile and follows people well
Oh really? You seem to like people a lot?
Yeah people like fall
Who does Kiki Autumn like to play with the most?
I like you the most and your mom next
Wow, usually mom comes first!
Me first and dad last
I guess Kiki's older sister plays with her and takes her for walks often! ?
Yeah, I really go for a walk once a day.
Wow, Gaeul really found a good family!
Yeah, it's really nice to meet you, Gaeul
Is your sister good at swimming?
No, I can't swim if I fall into the water.
Oh really? Then do you want to learn swimming with me?
I want to learn. There is a place to learn in front of my house.
Kiki, really? As far as I know, Nonsan is only available at the health center!
Yeah, right, right, I know that well.
Kiki, is there a health center near your house?
Yeah, that's right, my house is in the east
But I heard it's really difficult to apply there?
Ah, it must be fierce because of the ladies
That's right Kiki, my friend also woke up at dawn and applied!
Ah, it's really hard, really ㅠㅠ
Kiki: I think it's because Nonsan is the only one there!
Well, there's only one so the competition is fierce.
Kiki, that's right, but I don't want to do it because I'm being pushed around by the ladies!
Ah, seriously, these ladies are so tough ㅠㅠ
Sister, have you ever been to Kangwon Land?
No, I've never been there. I want to go.
Kiki Me too, but I've been to a place like this in Japan!
Oh, I really want to go too
Kiki, what do they call this place in Japan?
How is it? I don't know if it's called a casino
Hmm? Other than that name, do you know of a Japanese arcade game where you pull the handle on the TV?
Are you doing it by pulling the handle?
What is that? I don't know anything ㅠㅠ
Oh, that's not something you see often on TV, but they showed them playing that game. Did you see it?
Is it a joystick?
You said you were on Merge TV?
Is it Kachinpo? It was a game like this, and if you were good at it, you could win millions of won!
I'll have to ask my boyfriend. This is awesome.
Kiki, right? I went in and came out of Japan without knowing!
Oh, I really have to go there too
Kiki: Oh, but I'm going to spend about a thousand yen!
I'll go and try it too!
Sister, have you ever made a reservation at a pension and gone out to play recently?
Instead of a pension, I went glamping
Glamping!? Who did you go with!? Who did you go with!?
I went out with my friends
Friends from middle school
Kiki and I envy Kiki
How many people went and came back?
It was really fun, 5 people
5 people? But I think a place like that would be best with 5 people in the garden!
Yeah, that's right. That's the number of people.
Kiki, did you go and have a barbecue?
Yeah, I had barbecue and roasted marshmallows.
Wow, awesome marshmallows!
Where did you buy that?
It was really delicious
I bought it at Homeplus
Do they sell those thick marshmallows at Homeplus?
There's a thick one on sale at Homeplus
Wow, I'm going camping soon, so I need to buy that!
Yeah, try grilling with your friends.
Does your sister like making snowmen?
Yeah, I like it. I like snow too.
Kiki, that's right, eating tangerines in a warm place on a snowy day is the best!
Yes, it seems like eating tangerines on a snowy day is the best
Kiki, that's right. You have to eat tangerines until your hands turn yellow!
Yeah, my hands are really singing too
Kiki, did you know that if you eat a lot of tangerines, your whole body will turn yellow?
Oh really? Your whole body is getting tingly? Wow
Oh yeah, that makes scientific sense!
Oh really? I just found out today, Kiki.
Kiki I just found out too
It's cold these days, so I want to eat tangerines!
I have to tell mom and dad, Kiki
I want to eat it too because it's so delicious
Kiki, let me tell you about Kiki
I can eat a whole box of tangerines while sitting down!
I think I can eat it
Kiki, let's buy a box of tangerines and eat them together later!
It's good to buy it later and share it.
Sister, this time there was an article about a man being accused of sexual assault by his ex-wife!
Oh my god, this is crazy, aren't you?
But should I tell you why the ex-wife sued the man?
No, please tell me where it is
There's a daughter between them, and this man took his daughter to the men's bathroom!
Oh my god, this is so scary
No, but rather than being scary, doesn't it seem a bit like your ex-wife is using excuses to threaten you?
That's why it's weird and funny too
Kiki, that's right, his ex-wife had been suing him before that!
It's not the same reason!
Ah, I guess you wanted to say that your ex-wife is weird
Kiki: Well, don't you think it's a bit much to threaten your own daughter?
Didn't you take your daughter to go pee? That's a bit too much of a threat.
Oh, that's right. This man didn't like his daughter being away from him, so he took her away, but his ex-wife saw him and reported him right away!
What a strange woman. Is she really out of her mind?
Kiki right I think so too
I think you've lost your mind!
I shouldn't be that kind of person and neither should you haha
Sister, did you know that BTS and Ogame are both hot topics worldwide right now?
Really? You like BTS too
Oh, I really like BTS too!
Have you seen all the squid games? I have.
Kiki, I watched all the games too~
I'm going to go on another regular run now!
Oh seriously, I cried when I saw Grandpa number 1
Kiki, that's right, but didn't you get hit in the back of the head at the end?
I'm so sad but the ending was awesome
Kiki, that's right, Kiki, but Ogame is causing a worldwide uproar right now.
They call this an invasion of Korea!
Oh, it's really going to cause chaos worldwide.
Kiki admits that now our country has become a soft powerhouse in the world!
I admit, I admit, our country is a software powerhouse.
Kiki is right, she started out with BTS and soared with Ogame~
Now let's look forward to flying higher and higher
Kiki, that's right. I'm looking forward to BTS's new song!
Ah, I'm really looking forward to the song too
Did you know that you can get your lips tattooed too?
Yeah my friend did that
Oh really? My friend did that too and it hurt so much!
Oh, I really want to try it too
Didn't your sister say her friend was sick?
It hurts and it's so swollen, it looks like I got filler
Wow, how many hours does that procedure take?
They say it takes about an hour
I see. What color did you use?
I made it a bit lighter red
Light red? My friend had it a little orange!
Orange and I want to do it too
Kiki, do you think orange color suits your lips?
Yeah, that lip color suits you well
Kiki Then my sister is cute in orange!
Okay, I'll try it and let you know.
Does your sister get a lot of cavities?
No I never had one
Wow, really? Are you blessed with genes, unnie?
It's really good even though it's not managed
Wow, I'm jealous... Sister, do you brush your teeth three times a day?
Yeah, I do it all the time haha
Kiki, but I also do it regularly, but I got a cavity again this time.
Ah, really, take good care of your cavities
So,,, I went to the dentist for the first time in 2 years and I had 3 cavities!
Oh my gosh there are so many
Right, the cost of filling this cavity is expensive too.
Oh really it's expensive I got braces
Oh really? Isn't the cost of orthodontic treatment quite high?
Yeah, the correction fee is 5 million won.
Wow, my boyfriend said he heard it was around 500 too!
Wow, it's really expensive.
Does your sister use Timon often?
I use Coupang instead of Timon
If it's Coupang, how much do you pay a month to get free shipping?
No, that's not it. I like Coupang better.
Oh really? Does Coupang deliver faster?
I think Coupang is cheaper
Oh, I think that's what I thought too!
Wow, it's really cheap and affordable, and the shipping is fast.
Yeah, Timon is a bit slow!
Yeah it's slow I tried it too
Kiki Me too Kiki I like Naver Shopping more than Coupang!
Oh, I really use Naver a lot too.
Kiki, I see. I should try using Coupang sometime later!
I have to use it every day too
Kiki, every day?
Sister, are you a shopaholic?
I like doing it every day
Sister, have you ever been to a concert?
I went to a concert with the *** band
Oh really? How old were you when you went?
I like the hospital people and when I was 23 haha
Where was the concert held?
I did it at Nonsan Konyang University
Oh really? My house is really close to Konkuk University, why didn't I know about it!
Yeah, I did it in Nonsan, I wish I could do it again
Kiki Unnie *** Which song do you like the most among the band's songs?
*** I'm a total fanboy and I'm sending you
Sending you away?
What were the lyrics?
I suddenly can't remember the lyrics
I know the title, but I can't remember the song.
I guess I loved it? I like it!
I also suddenly got a blank sheet of paper and I got hit right away
Kiki, right? I want to go to a *** band concert too!
*** Let's go to the concert together later
Sister, what genre of movies do you like the most?
Um I like comedy
Comedy? Then I heard there's a movie similar to Exit coming out this time. Did you see it?
No, I haven't seen anything like the glory of the family.
Ah, daebak Kiki, I also enjoyed watching The Glory of the Family!
I've watched the entire series of True Family's Glory
Kiki, I think that episode was the most fun to watch, right before Kim Won-hee and Shin Hyun-joon got married!
Oh yeah, that was the most fun for me too
Kiki, right? Isn't comedian Kim Won-hee really good at speaking in a dialect?
She's witty, pretty, and good at acting.
Kiki right Kiki oh and what was it!?
Did Mrs. Kim Soo-mi make kimchi?
Kim Soo-mi is right, kimchi is famous
Kiki, that's right. And do you remember the scene when Kim Won-hee first met Kim Soo-mi's family and revealed that he was a prosecutor?
Yeah, I remember. I heard that Kim Soo-mi's kimchi is delicious haha.
I want to eat kimchi too
Kiki Ah Kim Soo-mi actress kimchi,
I tried it!
Oh, I really tried it, it's amazing
I'm happy again now~
Huh, all of a sudden?
How are you? Kiki
The Nakgopsae House has opened its doors again~
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh
Are you finally ordering? Kiki
Kiki Yeah, yeah but I'm not hungry right now so I'm going to order something to eat!
what
Is it because I ate something simple in the morning?
I just ate a few scoops of ice cream!
Kiki, I think that's what happens when you eat something
Kiki is right
Oh, I'm looking forward to it
But it's for two people
Oh right
There is a minimum amount ㅠㅠ
What about the rest?
I'm going to make that fried rice and eat it again for dinner!
Ah, I guess I'll eat all that today, Kiki
Kiki is right, I'm still happy
I've never eaten it before!
Oh, you haven't tried it yet?
That was bad, Kiki
Kiki, that's right
They say there's a good restaurant in Nonsan!?
Yeah, there's a good restaurant here too Kiki
Did your sister buy all of her home appliances new?
My house?
No ㅠㅠ
There are things to buy and things to use!
Oh really?
Sister, did you originally live alone?
Oh, I thought you were talking about Mom right now, Kiki
Our full option!
Kiki Huh, there's also a full option in Nonsan?
Yeah, if you look for the full option, you'll find it!
Oh really?
They live there on rent
No, it's the whole world~
I looked into it because I felt it was a waste to buy it when I moved into a new house. Kiki
I see
So what's in the full option?
Just the basics like a washing machine, refrigerator, TV, etc.!
So, did you buy a new mattress or something?
Yeah, I had to buy that so I just bought the cheap one ㅠㅠ
Oh, right, Kiki
You just have to hold out for a year!
Yeah, I just have to hold out for a year, Kiki's worth it
Kiki Oh, then how many rooms are there?
We have two rooms now!
Sister, are you planning on having a baby in the next year or so?
Yeah, I think we'll have a baby by then!
Then you'll change the car then too?
no
The car is not that far now, Kiki
Oh really?
Someone I know changed his car because of his baby!
Do you have a lot of children?
What did I change it to? ㅠㅠ
I heard you changed to a new Sorento this time, Kiki
Kiki What was it before that and why did it change? Kiki
I don't know the car either, but there is only one baby Kiki
If it's just one Kiki baby, you don't have to change it ㅠㅠ
I guess it's time for a change!
Hmm, when I looked at it, it didn't seem like it needed to be changed!
what...
Or maybe you just wanted to do something new Kiki
Kiki, is that so?
It takes 7 months to ship.
oh my god
So you're selling the car used now?
Maybe they'll sell it used?
Hoeh, if the tea is okay, please pass it to me Kiki
Sister, do you receive a salary from your father?
Yeah, my mom is giving me my salary Kiki
Wow, how many hours do you work a day?
Um, 9 hours a day? I think you work that much, Kiki.
Then I'll get over 200!
No... 180? I'll give you that and write it separately.
Kiki it's okay
My sister is family, so I won't leave her alone!
Yeah, I don't do that, and my mom buys me more stuff, so it's okay Kiki
Oh, the welfare is awesome. Can I go there? Kiki
Yeah you come and do it ㅠㅠ I'm going out Kiki
Kiki, no, not work, Kiki as an adopted daughter
Oh yeah
Then you take care of it instead, Kiki
Kiki Oh, being filial isn't that hard~
Yeah, I'll give you a massage and be your conversation partner, Kiki.
I heard that an older brother of mine served in the Navy.
Wow, the Navy? That's cool.
Is that worth doing?
But I heard there are a lot of soldiers who vomit outside because of motion sickness.
Wow, the one who throws up Kiki
Oh my gosh, what should I do? ㅠㅠ
Kiki is really having a hard time
Those kids who forgot about that time and didn't bring motion sickness medicine
But if you get motion sickness, you can't join the Navy, right?
I don't know
But aren't they random too?
Even if I take medicine for seasickness, it won't help, right?
no
They said it would be okay if I took that medicine!
Oh, but I guess it's tolerable motion sickness Kiki
Is that so?
I don't know Kiki
But once you get on a boat, it lasts for several months!
Oh, you're just going to keep riding without any vacation?
Well, when you come out on land, that's when you're on vacation Kiki
Wow, then I think I'll get motion sickness on land later too Kiki
Kiki Oh, then I guess you'll hate it too much?
They say you get seasick when you ride a boat, Kiki
Did you study well in high school, sister?
no...
Kids always teased me for being stupid ㅠㅠ
Huh? I think you studied well, unnie.
No Kiki's birthday
I did better than each other and didn't do that!
really?
Sister, what rank did you get in your class?
How many places behind me were you...
Ahh Kiki I was just average
Kiki originally said that moderation is the hardest thing Kiki
But it's not that you can't do it, it's that you don't do it!
No ㅠㅠ
I tried my best, didn't I?
Kiki Oh wow, your sister's school must have been a bit tough
Yeah, I guess it was because the kids worked hard ㅠㅠ
Kiki is right
I also played behind the scenes when I was in middle school.
Originally, they were playing around behind the scenes too!
Kiki is right
I played around in everything except math!
Kiki, you were good at math though
Kiki looks smart!
When you have a baby, do you want to have a son or a daughter?
I love my daughter ㅠㅠ
Please give me my daughter ㅠㅠ
Kiki, are you planning to have only one child?
Yeah, we don't have any plans to have many children yet!
Kiki, I think it would be better to have a daughter later on too!
Kiki, you know, people often say that raising a son is useless. Kiki
There is a saying that a well-raised daughter is better than ten sons~
Yeah and I have a younger brother too so I think it's good to have a daughter Kiki
Kiki: That's right, I have to go to the bathhouse with my daughter!
Yeah, you guys are all daughters, so I guess your dad would be upset Kiki
Kiki not really but dad wanted to have a grandson but mom refused
Yeah, Mom, it's hard, Kiki
There's nothing I can do about it ㅠㅠ
Kiki is right
If I had given birth, we would have been 4 years apart?
But when I found out, it turned out to be my daughter ㅠㅠ
Kiki, something bigger is going on
Kiki Oh, then there's nothing I can do about it~
Kiki's dad is depressed, so Kiki
Kiki doesn't come out of the room
When you got married, who did you give the bouquet to?
I already got it back from my friend Kiki
Oh, are you getting the bouquet back?
Yeah, that guy you know got it. It's mine. Kiki.
Oh, I see!
That older sister is getting married!?
no
Dog, you don't seem to care right now, Kiki
Kiki I'm worried because my friend is getting married next year and he asked me to receive the wedding gift.
Oh, but these days, if you give it back within 100 days, it's over Kiki.
Is that okay?
The bouquet is meant to be received by the person who is about to leave!
no
These days, there are many single people, so they say it's all a thing of the past.
Oh really?
thank god
But what if I miss that?
are you okay
I'm going to tell you to throw it there until you get it Kiki
Kiki dog funny kiki
Then I should dry the bouquet nicely and give it to you!
Yeah, make it pretty and give it to me as a frame or diffuser!
Oh, the diffuser is nice!
Thanks for the good information~
Yeah, I'll send you a picture of mine later, Kiki
Sister, among the animals that are being raised a lot these days, I think hedgehogs are also good
A hedgehog?
Are you talking about hedgehogs?
Yeah Kiki
Hedgehogs are being raised a lot these days!
But I was scared that I would get stabbed ㅠㅠ
no
If you recognize that you are the owner, you won't be able to stop it!
But it won't take long to realize it ㅠㅠ
Well, wouldn't it be okay if I raised it from when it was a puppy!?
Yeah, I guess I'll have to wear rubber gloves and wash it with a toothbrush, Kiki.
Kiki dog laugh
I heard that babies secretly like half-body baths too!
Wow... a half-body bath too?
Isn't that better than a human? Kiki
But for babies, all you have to do is give them a half-bath in the sink.
Yeah, that's right
It's so small I think it'll be enough Kiki
Kiki Aou, among the YouTubers, there's a kid that Goshim raises. He poops while taking a half-body bath. Kiki
Kiki Oh my Kiki Then I have to clean that up and stuff, right? Kiki
Kiki, I guess this is what it means to really like something and get bored. Kiki
Ah, I'm so happy, Kiki, I guess you liked it so much, Kiki
Sister, have you ever tried any exercise like yoga?
Yeah, I've tried yoga once!
Oh, how about yoga?
are you okay?
Yeah but it's a bit difficult ㅠㅠ
Are you trying to do it?
I want to do it, but is it okay if I get hurt?
Yeah, it was hard because I was so tired, Kiki
What kind of yoga are you looking for?
There are other exercises like Kiki or yoga.
What do you call that?
Yoga hot yoga flying yoga I only know this much ㅠㅠ
Oh, have you tried flying yoga?
Yeah, I've experienced that!
Does the experience cost money?
How much does it cost?
no
I don't hear that
I went with a friend one day and experienced it Kiki
Kiki, I see
How is it if you try that?
In fact, I found it easier and more effective than regular yoga!
Oh really?
If you do flying yoga, you hang up some kind of blanket and do it, right?
Yeah, that's right
It was more comfortable because there was something to hold onto, Kiki
Sister, do you have any arcade games you can play with your boyfriend?
No ㅠㅠ
Not yet
So I was thinking of buying a plus, Kiki
Oh really?
Have you never played a game while dating?
Yeah, I just went to the arcade and played Tekken? I played that Kiki
Wow, Kiki's plot twist?
Sister, are you good at Tekken?
No, I can't do it Kiki
I'm so pissed off because I lost so much, Kiki
Kiki's boyfriend keeps winning!?
This won't work!
therefore
I should have given in a little bit, but I was excited by myself, Kiki
Kiki dog laugh
Is it 500 won per game then?
no
Don't do this for 200 won!
Oh, right
It was 200 won each, right?
Yeah, it's up now
I don't know ㅠㅠ
It's probably 500 won now?
The average is about 500 won now
Oh my gosh, it's so expensive ㅠㅠ
I can't do it because it's expensive
Kiki, so
I haven't done it since then!
Kiki, just be satisfied with what you've done and let it end, Kiki
Sister, don't you go on a vacation or something after you finish your current work?
Yeah, just healing at home was the best, Kiki
Kiki's home is the best too
I'm going to go on a train trip!
Kiki Oh, can I go on a train trip now?
Well, if you just take the train to another region, that's train travel~
Kiki, I thought you were talking about that train ride Kiki
Oh, are you talking about the train trip tomorrow?
Yeah, but I don't think they're doing it now because of Corona ㅠㅠ
Oh really?
But I really want to go to Busan!
Yeah, I wanted to try that at least once ㅠㅠ
Yeah Kiki
But I'm in Seoul right now, so taking the train to Busan is a no-no~
Kiki, why doesn't the KTX get there quickly?
These days, airplanes are cheaper and faster than KTX!
Oh really?
I can't ride it because I'm afraid the waiting time will be long ㅠㅠ
Oh, come to think of it, that's true!?
There will be time to go for a ride, right? ㅠㅠ
Seems similar?
Sister, you said you like spring weather the best, right?
Yeah, it's late spring!
That was the best time Kiki
Then, I recommend Mir Island in Gongju in spring!
Oh, if you go there around that time, is it pretty and nice?
Yeah, that's right
The flowers are blooming really beautifully!
Then the photos will come out really well Kiki
Would you like it if I went with your mom?
Kiki Oh, you really like it!
You can ride a bike there too!
My mom doesn't know how to ride a bike...
Let's ride a two-person bike and have my sister pull it~
Kiki no
I don't think I can go with my mom ㅠㅠ
Then, the whole family comes together and gets a 4-person bike!
Kiki Before that, Mom, I just need to teach you how to ride a bike Kiki
Kiki no that
What if something big happens?
no
Originally, you learn how to ride a bicycle by falling down. Kiki
ZZ It was okay when I was young, but now my joints are out so it's not okay!
Then I should tell my dad to give me a ride ㅠㅠ
Did you see the big news about the murder case this time?
no
Murder case?
There seem to be a lot of murder cases these days ㅠㅠ
Oh right ㅜㅜ
A man killed a woman he had no connection to.
Wow, they weren't even related, so they just killed each other?
That's the deal he made with BJ, the girl he often saw, and BJ's family being killed because she kicked him out!
Oh, you didn't do anything to deserve being kicked out?
I guess I just hurled a lot of curse words and slander!
Then it's worth it ㅡㅡ
Why would you kill your family?
He said that if you don't release the black, he will harm your family.
But do you know how I found my family?
Wow, he even threatened me ㅠㅠ
How did you find it?
This woman, Vijay, once mentioned her family's occupation and she remembered it and looked it up.
Wow, awesome
He went to that place and stalked her. It was really annoying.
that's right
A stalker and even a death threat ㅜㅜ
And do you know what happened to this guy?
I'm so scared I could die ㅠㅠ
What happened?
This woman killed her family and then committed suicide.
So the case is closed,
Wow, awesome
You committed suicide?
There was a professor in Japan who said something nonsense like comfort women were a fantasy?
Huh? You're claiming that this is a fantasy story that doesn't exist?
Yeah, that's right
This professor seems to be famous in this area!
It's ridiculous. I can't even apologize sincerely. ㅡㅡ
therefore
This person distorts and denies reality and promotes false history.
Why are there so many crazy people in the world?
But the Japanese people actually signed a petition to force this professor out!
Kiki that's funny
So Japan also admits that?
I guess it's because young people these days don't deny it, but rather accept it as it is!
Yeah, that's right
These days, the younger generation is like that, so the above should follow suit Kiki
Kiki is right,
But if Japan admits it, they'll have to give us consolation money or something like that, right?
Oh, is there also something like a consolation money?
Then I hope you admit it quickly ^^
And Japan has a strong sense of pride, so they deny it even more!
Kiki is right
And they really hate looking bad -_-
Kiki is right
Ha, I see that professor told Koreans to think that it was an honor to have become Japanese comfort women.
Wow, this is really ridiculous.
He told me to get kicked out quickly!
Did you get it done at the place introduced by the Sudmeda company?
no
I found out everything and proceeded ㅠㅠ
Did you do them all separately?
That must have been hard!
Yeah, we did everything separately ㅠㅠ But I was still satisfied!
that's right
You have to do it in a place you like, so the photos will last a lifetime!
Yeah, the photo and the dress were changed twice Kiki
Kiki Hull, why did you change your dress?
I was worried and chose the shiny one, but the kids thought something else would suit them better, so I was worried ㅠㅠ
Oh but when it comes to dresses, you have to choose ones that suit your friends!
Yeah, that's right
Other people's eyes are more accurate, Kiki
that's right
That's a good choice!
Yeah, that's why I changed it, Kiki
I was satisfied and so was I haha
What design did you change Kiki's dress to?
There's one with a king ribbon on it, Kiki, that's pretty!
Oh, I think the ribbon will suit you well, unnie
Well done!
Yeah, I think you made a good choice, Kiki
Sister, did you get insurance?
Yeah, I have insurance right now Kiki
Have you heard of things like car insurance and insurance for Sylvie?
Yeah, that's a given!
Kiki, yeah these are really essential!
Are you well insured?
I'm overflowing right now, I need to clean up,
Wow, how much did you hear? It's overflowing Kiki
Kiki, I've heard a lot about my family's chronic illness.
Oh, then shouldn't I be holding it because I'm anxious?
Um, no, there are so many different types that I'll organize them!
Ah, then please organize it a bit ㅠㅠ
I don't want to waste money
Yeah Kiki
If I organize this, I think I'll get about 1.5 million won!
Wow, awesome...
But the amount I paid was bigger ㅠㅠ
But that can't be helped, that's it ㅜ
Yeah, but let's organize this before we go any further ㅠㅠ
Sister, do you shop online often?
I don't shop much these days Kiki
Then you don't do things like Naver Shopping well?
Yeah, I'm doing a lot of eye shopping right now Kiki
Oh, what are you watching these days?
I've been seeing a lot of nutritional supplements lately Kiki
Oh, what kind of supplement are you looking at?
It's good for your eyes ㅠㅠ
My eyes are so tired these days ㅠㅠ
Kiki: So you're looking at magnesium?
Yeah right Kiki
Lutein I'm also watching that Kiki
Oh, so lutein is also a good nutrient for the eyes?
Yeah, that's really famous as an eye nutrient!
I see
My eyes are twitching too, so I'm taking magnesium these days!
Kiki, where are you eating?
If it works, please recommend it~
Oh, what I eat is shipped overseas!
Wow... I guess I'll have to wait a long time Kiki
Sister, aren't you watching YouTube these days?
I don't watch any of the kids these days, but I watch Super Junior's Kiki
Did that start recently?
I've been doing this for a long time, but my friend is a fan so he recommended it to me. Kiki, this is funny
Kiki, really?
Are all the Super Junior members coming out?
Yeah, some of them come out, but it seems to be different depending on the schedule? Kiki
Oh, I see
Who is the member who appears frequently?
Shindong and Teuk often come out and meet Kiki
You're an MC haha
Kiki Ah, and Leeteuk too
If Kiki and the two appear, it will be a guide comic
Yeah really Donghae and Eunhyuk are funny too Kiki
Kiki, Donghae is secretly a gag character, I admit!
Yeah, she's so cute, I almost got addicted to her too Kiki
Kiki is so funny, Donghae is so cute!
I should see that too~
Yeah subscribe to that Kiki
Time really flies Kiki
Kiki oki oki
Add one more subscriber~
Oh, so that's how I promoted it~
Sister, is there any movie you've seen so far that you would recommend to me?
Do you like sad movies too?
Well, I personally like action haha,
If it's action... look at Liam Neeson's...
Oh Kiki, I know that guy well Kiki
Have you seen the whole movie Taken?
Oh, I haven't seen that, but isn't that a series of movies?
Yeah, that's right
It came out up to 3, but how is it in full swing?
Kiki Oh, I have to check that out
Is it on Netflix?
Ah... I don't know about that, Kiki
You may have to pay Kiki
Kiki, ah, it's okay, it's okay. Just watch it on Naver Movies~
Is there a movie on Naver?
What is that?...
You buy movies from Naver and watch them!
Oh, I just found out about that, Kiki
I should search for it Kiki
Kiki Maybe you could watch all of Taken for 1300 won!
Oh, this is awesome.
Kiki, that's so cheap
What is your favorite food, Grandma?
I like braised short ribs the most because they are so delicious~
Does your grandmother like cows the best?
Okay then
Is it because you have a sophisticated mouth? Haha
Kiki, but don't you feel sorry for the cow?
no
The beef is so juicy and delicious~
Kiki and daebak
My first daughter should make braised short ribs for her mother's birthday~
Well, I guess we should go out and buy some food?
Kiki, then I'll buy you some braised short ribs~
Should I ask you to buy it for me or should I go and cut up a steak?
Kiki, when was your little mom's birthday?
I remember~
I'm counting by the lunar calendar, so it's between January and February.
Oh really?
Then, it's January for me too. Do you want to go eat together?
Good
I heard there are a lot of delicious restaurants these days~
Kiki, there's a good restaurant in Nonsan~
Yeah, let's go on our birthdays.
It's really cold today,
You turned on the light in the room,
Oh, so that's why there's communal heating there?
that's right,
It was really cold earlier, but it's warm now!
I know
You have to pay well for that rent.
Kiki But this really doesn't work in winter!
It's really colder in the metropolitan area, Kiki
Kiki and don't turn it on warmly!
right
It's lukewarm so I'm cold
Electric blanket is required
Kiki is right,
They tell me to keep the blanket on, but it doesn't work.
So you're there all winter?
Oh, I think that's what it's supposed to be!
I heard the contract is until January ㅜㅜ
Oh right
Here's a contract until January 1st!
Oh, then you're going back down after leaving the room?
Kiki, that's right,
I'm out of money now,
I came to Seoul and had a hard time~
Mom, have you ever been on an airplane?
Yeah, I only rode it when I went to Jeju Island before~
Did you go to Jeju Island for a family trip?
Yeah, I went when the kids were little~ Kiki
So you haven't ridden one recently?
Yeah, that's the last time
Almost 10 years ago
Oh my~ It's been so long ㅜㅜ
Don't you want to ride an airplane?
You want to ride it, but it's too expensive?
Hurry up ㅜㅜ I'm planning to go this time to celebrate my dad's retirement!
Oh~ Are you riding from Cheongju?
Or Gunsan?
Kiki, depending on the time, I'm thinking of going to Cheongju or Gunsan!
When are you retiring, Dad?
Retire this December!
You should have a retirement party~
Oh, but I haven't been fully vaccinated yet, so I decided to get vaccinated and go!
You haven't gotten the vaccine yet?
Have you ever worked part-time, mama?
Side jobs were really popular back in the day~
Wow Kiki, I also tried a side job once!
Do you know how to fold a mask pack?
Oh really?
If it's a sheet mask, shouldn't it be done in a clean environment?
I don't think that's it either, I did it when I went out instead of at home
Oh, go?
I worked part-time at my friend's house!
You're so young, what kind of side job are you doing?
Kiki, I was just helping her mom with her chores!
So how much did you get paid per day?
I folded 100 sheets and got 2,000 won!
What the~
I just got paid for tteokbokki Kiki
Kiki, that's right
I just saved up that amount of money and went out to eat with my friends!
cute
When did you do it? Kiki's side job
I did it when I was in middle school!
Are you doing a lot of other things now?
Cheer up haha
My second son, Ram, didn't you buy anything from PX?
Last time I told you to buy snail cream, but this is what I got
He came on vacation, but he didn't buy it?
Draw.
If you don't give him money, he won't buy it.
Kiki, you still have to give me money to buy it~
Can you buy me a present, Mom?
But that's true
That won't even cost ten thousand won!
I know
So my daughter's friend bought me a lot of things~
Kiki's daughter's friend is much better than her son's!
I know
Maybe it's because I'm old, Kiki
Kiki, is your friend 23 years old?
No, twenty-four, Kiki
I heard that my child went to the military late~
But whether they're 22 or 24, men are all the same~
I know
My son has a 30-year-old brother in the military.
Oh, right, Kiki
I'll definitely buy it when I get discharged this time
Let me tell you~
That's right
Otherwise, don't even think about coming home.
Grandma, what did you teach your eldest daughter when she was little?
There's nothing I haven't done
But he's also stupid
Kiki, why aren't you better than the second one?
Draw
But I played around in high school so college isn't fun.
Why don't you do well if you graduate from a university's taxation department?
It's a top-tier system, so everyone can go in there~
What do you mean when you say that everyone in the upper class gets in?
Anyone can go in?
You don't necessarily have to study hard
Kiki, really?
But if I major in taxation, I'll have a good chance of getting a job, right?
I hope you get a job soon
Play all day~
But right now, it's the COVID-19 pandemic and the unemployment rate is at its peak ㅜㅜ
I know
It's going to get harder from now on
My eldest daughter is doing well on her own, so it'll be okay!
Yeah, I'm attending a cyber university now.
Kiki, really?
Did you transfer?
no
Just say you're getting a diploma
Grandma, what happened to your brother?
I have 7 daughters and 1 son. How scary is that?
Kiki, is this true?
How many sons are you?
Ah, six daughters and one son
1st son, almost the youngest line
Our little house is also 5 girls and 1 boy Kiki
I know
So the daughter-in-law will have a hard time
that's right
Did the first son get married there too?
Yeah but we don't get along
Who are you not on good terms with?
With your daughter-in-law and sisters?
It's like that with my daughter-in-law~
It's hard to even see your face
But my daughter-in-law will be stressed just hearing about her 6 sisters-in-law.
right
One word is six words, so Kiki
I can't help it
that's right,
Even small houses eventually fall apart,
right
It's no joke there either now
that's right,
Even my grandfather and grandmother are not in good health.
Aren't you both in the hospital right now?
What do you think your eldest daughter will do if she gets married?
Welcome with open arms
Who will take it?
Kiki, really?
My mom told me not to get married!
Why don't you get married?
Don't get married, you're better off alone!
That's true
Your mother must have had a hard time after getting married.
Yeah Kiki
And all the men in our Jo family are children~
I fully understand how much it rots your mind.
So Kiki
But I think my sister is going to get married?
When are you getting married?
I'm getting older so I have to do it soon
Maybe she'll settle down with her boyfriend?
I heard you're meeting your parents too!
already?
When did you decide to meet?
As far as I know, we were supposed to meet in November!
Did you just say let's eat?
Or are you taking it seriously?
No!
He said let's just eat first~
Oh my... I'm already getting married
I hope it goes well
Grandma, your eldest daughter is raising a puppy. What do you think?
No furry animals
But I raised a dog, a cat, and a hamster~
You heard right Kiki
I'm getting married and living like that
But if I go to my grandmother's house to play, won't I take her with me?
yes
It's okay for a while, but living together is difficult
Kiki, from now on, Mommy has to practice how to touch furry animals~ For later.
Well ㅜㅜ
It's pretty to look at
Especially the Pomeranian is cute
But you don't like being touched?
no
I just don't like the smell and the hair flying around.
Aren't our Obok totally cute?
that's right
But I think it's also fierce
Kiki is right,
But I don't get angry at my grandmother.
Yeah, did you see that little daddy yapping?
I almost died laughing
Yeah Kiki
It's really disgusting when a cat hisses!
That's because my little dad teased me
Do you know about Little Mom Climbing?
Have you tried it?
There's a climbing gym in the neighborhood. How is it?
I'm a flying orangutan~
I don't know~?
How much of that have you learned?
It's been 3 years since I've been here and I haven't done much Kiki
Are you self-taught?
Or did you take separate lessons?
No~
I went to a climbing academy~
How much is the tuition fee for this course?
It's 100,000 won a month there, so in 3 months it's 280,000 won!
It's a lot cheaper than I thought.
Here you get 30 a month
Wow, that's crazy expensive!
Come here!
It's expensive because it's a tuition fee, but the facilities are good
Kiki, the facilities here aren't bad either!
Do they offer one-on-one lessons there too?
I think that's pretty much how it's done!
Oh, then it's definitely cheap and good
Grandma, don't you like games like Hwatu or Seotda?
I played seotda once in my youth~
So that's why the kids play so well?
Yeah, that's right
Who do you resemble?
Now that I look at it, I know who it resembles~
right
I beat your dad too
Kiki, really?
I've never seen my grandmother do that!
You went out to play with your friends on New Year's Day, right?
Kiki, is that so?
How much did you earn then?
I wasn't going to pay, I was just going to buy the kids chicken.
Kiki is right
The person who gets the most money there gets the chicken!
Yeah so I ate dasarang chicken haha
Kiki, really?
I should have eaten Kyochon Chicken Honey Combo~
But my little mom says Dasarang is the best in Nonsan
Kiki, really?
But now all that love is gone,
It's a shame, it was our regular place, Kiki
Next time I'll buy you Kyochon
Did you have fun when our princess family went on a trip?
Okay~
I liked the Starlight Festival, there was a lot to see.
that's right
They put a really bright neon sign on the jangseung.
I know
I took a lot of pictures too
Kiki, how many years ago was that?
Aren't you going to travel somewhere else next time?
Should I not go?
What if we all get vaccinated now!?
So where do you want to go?
I don't care where
Aren't we collecting membership fees?
Yeah, the adults are walking together.
Later overseas mission
Hey, how long has it been since you walked that?
Well, it seems pretty old, right?
I want to join them and go on an overseas trip!
You should get vaccinated first.
Kiki, I'm going to get Moderna in January~
They said Moderna is better
Does your grandmother like to step on fallen leaves?
Yeah, that's why fall is the best
I don't really like stepping on autumn leaves.
Why? Don't you like the rustling?
I have to sweep my yard...
Did you sweep it all up?
Okay~
If my dad doesn't write, I'll write it all~
There must be a lot of leaves falling now~
No kidding
There's a big persimmon tree!
That's right, the leaves are huge
Kiki is right
This time, the persimmons have ripened a lot and the leaves have also opened a lot!
I guess I'll have to grab you and sweep you up there~
Kiki, that's right
Then, you can throw it at Won Bin like you're throwing a leaf at him~
Kiki, if you play with fallen leaves, you have to pick them up again, no~
Kiki, now let's play rock-paper-scissors and whoever loses gets to play again~
Oh my, sweep it all away and burn it all at once.
The sexual assault accuser fainted after the investigation because the prosecutor asked her if she had any sexual experience.
What if the inspectors are stupid?
But it's true that the prosecution should ask questions to make an accurate judgment, but they laughed at Kiki
I have to turn around and say it
You should get beaten up for laughing at me
This plaintiff sued her boss for sexual assault, but the suspect defended her by saying that they had a relationship because they liked each other!
I really doubt that the test is correct.
It's really regrettable
He said that while he was being dragged away by his boss, there was a scene on CCTV where he hit a wall, and he laughed and said that it was just a joke!
It seems crazy to speak like that in a serious courtroom.
therefore,
It's true that you should ask, but I feel like your actions are so wrong!
Still, there must have been various circumstances captured on CCTV.
Ignore that
therefore,
The plaintiff cried after recovering and after the prosecution investigation, saying that she felt like she had lost hope.
In that case, I think we need to borrow power other than the power of the law.
Where's Kiki?
Are you calling those shoulder uncles?
Yeah, you have older brothers.
I need to buy some for my uncles and beat them up
Kiki But that might be a better way than the law!
That's why
It'll be solved in one go.
In China, unlike us, there are a lot of empty houses!
The situation in China is not good right now. What's going on?
that's right
They thought China would develop its real estate industry and built a ton of buildings!
Oh, but is that because not as many people are buying it as expected?
Oh, and they built so recklessly that tens of millions of houses are now empty!
Then construction companies will have a lot of debt.
Hey, this isn't a joke right now
They're all going bankrupt!
Then what are you going to do with all those empty houses?
yes,
Now I see that there are 30 million empty houses!
Oh, this is really serious.
It's all money and debt.
So Kiki
They say that's enough houses for 80 million people to live in!
I'm afraid that our country will soon end up like that.
that's right
Our real estate bubble is too big!
They are still building a lot of apartments. Honestly, if interest rates go up, people won't be able to pay their debts.
Kiki is right,
But it's so ridiculously expensive!
I know
Real estate prices have gone up too much
Is Grandma going to keep that hairstyle?
Hmm I think I'll try short hair soon haha
Oh, little mom, short hair looks great on you!
Yeah, my head was so badly damaged that it couldn't be repaired.
Kiki's little mom doesn't even bleach her hair, so why is she injured?
Since I dye my hair blue often, there's nothing I can do about my hair~
Oh, I see
I guess the hair dye is toxic!
then
I have to do this almost once a month without fail
Oh, I see ㅜㅜ
Are you not thinking of spreading black pepper?
I tried it but it was too annoying and inconvenient
Oh, right, Kiki
Do you dye your hair at home?
no
It's easier to go to a beauty salon and get it done
How much does it cost to dye your hair?
I got paid about 40 thousand won.
It's because the length is long
Is it expensive because it also involves full-body dyeing?
Yeah, that's right~
I'm sick of dyeing my hair now
Does your grandmother have a lot of cavities?
Yeah, I just got a crown a while ago
Oh my gosh ㅜㅜ But where did you not get an implant~
I don't snack much so I don't get it
thank god
Crown, but the price is expensive.
I heard they paid about 50 thousand won
are you okay
You only received 50 thousand won? It's a crown?
Yeah, the dentist here is a bit cheaper, so I go there often.
I paid 400 thousand won for the crown!
It depends on the material used.
I see
I said I made it with porcelain material!
Porcelain is quite expensive
that's right
They said this was the strongest!
Yeah I went with the cheap one and it's fine
When was the crown put on?
Did you put it on recently?
It hasn't even been a month Kiki
It doesn't cost any money because it's well managed
Does your grandmother often go home shopping?
then
I bought Omega 3 this time too~
How much did you pay for Kiki Omega Three?
I gave you 100,000 won for 3 months~ Kiki
Because it was broadcast
My mom bought 6 months worth of pomegranate jelly Kiki
Oh, that's good too
Menopause was great~
that's right
That's because fish also contain collagen!
Yeah, I've tried that before, but I'm going to keep eating just one.
Kiki is right
That was delicious, but I ate it all quickly!
Yeah, omega is fine too
Buy me one, Mom
Oh good!
Mom, did you buy that for the whole family to eat?
no
I should eat it alone
Then it won't work
Have you bought anything else besides Kiki Omega Three?
I bought magnesium~
My eyes are twitching a lot these days
Kiki, wow, you made a good purchase
Which home shopping site did you buy it from?
It's number 6, but I don't remember where it is.
My mom often uses Hyundai Home Shopping~
I don't know Kiki well because I remember it as a channel
Have you ever been to a concert, Grandma?
I've never been there, but celebrities have been to my neighborhood a few times~
Oh really?
Which celebrities came and went?
I don't know, but I heard Mamamoo came
Is there any chance that Mamamoo will come there?
I came here before when there was a Hwaseong Cultural Heritage Festival.
Oh, right, Kiki
Then, does your grandmother watch YouTube often?
Yeah I see you almost every day
Drama Highlights
Ah, drama highlight?
What are you watching?
Kiki, the red shoes, the mountain girl, etc.
Kiki I'll watch Love and War again with that goodness!
When was that? Are you still watching it?
Kiki, you still edited it well!
The picture quality is so bad that I'm having a hard time these days~
Kiki, huh~ Are you watching Little Mom and the Ae-ro couple too?
then
I've seen it on TV often
Does your mom like sad movies?
I don't watch movies often, but I went to the cinema once to see something sad.
Oh really? That
When was it shown?
Don't cross that river, you know?
Oh my gosh, that's a really sad documentary!
Yeah but I was so sleepy I slept
Kiki but I also watched it at night and fell asleep in the middle Kiki
I went with my daughter and she cried when she saw it.
Kiki I went to see it with my boyfriend and we both drooled Kiki
The documentary is quiet, so it's perfect for me
Do you know the sound of the bell?
Kiki is right
Didn't Warangsori come out earlier than this movie?
Yeah, and the sound of the grass makes me sleepier
Kiki, really?
I didn't know that because I only saw the edited version! Kiki
It was once released as a holiday special, but I fell asleep after 5 minutes.
Oh really? Kiki
That's a total lullaby
Kiki was a totally healing movie for me
Honey, what are you having for dinner tonight?
My mom made me some noodles for the feast!
Wow, awesome Kiki
It's perfect because it's cold today!
right
Noodles in hot soup
you?
I'm eating ice cream right now! Hehe
Huh? What is aisim?
First time hearing about it
Kiki ice cream~ I'm eating yogurt ice cream!
Will that fill you up?
I have to eat
are you okay
I had a hearty meal of pork soup earlier!
Oh, the noodles are good
Is there a good restaurant in the neighborhood?
I ordered delivery
4. It was 9 points!
4.9 pages It looks like a real restaurant Kiki
Do you give a lot of meat too?
Kiki, they even give you extra meat as a review service?
Wow, does this noodle restaurant also have a review service?
good night
that's right
Kiki, isn't that awesome?
It even tastes good!
Next time I go to your house, let me do it too.
Honey, did you go to the real estate office today!?
Yeah, I went and came back, but I didn't sign the contract~
Kiki ha, I saw on the news that house prices might fall again.
I know.
And it looks like the construction loan hasn't been paid off yet.
Oh really?
Is there a place you want to go?
I was trying to move into a newly built officetel near the subway station.
Kiki, somewhere near Doksan Station?
that's right...
But I'm just going to commute to work
Kiki, isn't it so hard to commute to work?
Yeah, but I'm just going to save that money and use it when I get married later.
Kiki, aren't you a small business owner now?
that's right
But I'm preparing to move to another place
Then, take out a small business loan, buy a house, and then change jobs!
Yeah, should I try it right before I quit my job? Kiki
Hey, hurry up and prepare the documents and apply!
I'll have to try this before the lending regulations come into effect. Thanks!
Honey, there are bugs in your car. Shouldn't it be time to change the engine oil?
Our bug is now dying,
Kiki, why! I rode it because I cared for you so much!
I guess it's old, so I need to change it!
that's right
It was time for our Byeolkado to go again this time, so my sister went!
Byeolka, what happened when you left it for repairs last time?
Hey, last time I went to change my tire because my car got a flat.
Did you go for official repairs?
Or industrial history?
no
I just went to a regular tire store and I don't know if my sister changed it!
If it's worn out, you should replace it with a good one.
Kiki no
It wasn't wear and tear, it was torn by a rock hitting the car.
Then you have to change it quickly, it's dangerous...
But when I asked other people, they said that you just have to not run too hard!
no
But if you want to take a highway or something, change it.
Kiki is right
But now my sister is riding, so she'll take care of it!
Yeah, you actually gave the car to your sister?
Oppa, what was the hardest part-time job you had?
I have worked at Coupang Logistics Center
Wow, awesome,
Have you seen anyone die from overwork while working at Coupang recently?
Yeah, that wasn't a problem at the time.
Oh my gosh ㅜㅜ So
Was it really hard there?
Coupang, a company made of people~
Haha I'm crying
How many hours did you work there?
Fixed for 8 hours.
Break time is one hour to 50 minutes later.
Wow, we work 8 hours and they only give us a 50-minute break?
It's supposed to be an hour, but it takes 50 minutes
Wow, honestly, if it's 8 hours, shouldn't you give 10 minutes every hour?
That's why I really wanted to swear and never do it again.
Kiki, so
When did you first do it?
I suddenly needed money this summer~
Hal Kiki So how much did you earn?
I think I made 30 a week
Oppa, what was the hardest thing for you in the military?
I had a hard time with the poor quality of food
Oh right,
I experienced it at the barracks camp too.
Did you go to the barracks camp? Kiki
Why did you go
Kiki Na?, I was sent by force from the academy,
I guess you're not really listening
No, it's Kiki
I just took all the kids from the academy back then.
Oh, where did you go to the military camp?
Oppa, do you happen to know what Oido is?
Is Oido next to Ansan?
Kiki, no, it's in Incheon.
Ah... isn't there a Marine Corps base in Incheon?
Kiki, right, everyone was wearing red hats, right?
Kiki is an assistant
If you look closely at those kids, there are some who are not yet in the military.
Kiki is right
No, it wasn't a minor, it was just kids who had taken a leave of absence from college.
What would immature kids do?
Oppa, didn't you say you wanted to go to a vocal academy back then?
that's right!
So I looked into adult classes
So what happened?
What happened to that stern boss back then?
The teacher was about to give up Kiki
I'm used to it now and I'm doing well
Kiki But didn't you say that you liked that person a lot more than before and that you wanted to go too?
Oh right
So I got a business card too~
Oh really?
I also wanted to go, so I looked into it, and it said it was 500,000 won for 3 times a week!
Oh, that's too expensive
It's a bubble.
Kiki, really?
How much did your brother find out?
How about 250,000 won a month, twice a week?
Oh, are you okay?
Is this a place in Pyeongtaek?
Yeah, is it cheap because it's Pyeongtaek?
I see
I first found out about Kiki in Gangnam
Everything seems expensive in Gangnam
that's right,
That's why I gave up after only checking the price.
I know
You'd better find something else
Did your family create something like a family chat room?
Oh, there's a group chat room
But no one says anything
Kiki, we too
They only say happy birthday on my birthday!
Yeah, that's because there are only three of us guys
Kiki, I see
My aunt is turning 60 this year. What should I do for her?
Are you 60 years old?
Hey, how about a department store gift certificate?
Department store gift certificate?
I think I need to talk to my cousins first!
Yeah, I'll save up some money and buy you one~
Kiki, would that be okay?
Since it's Nonsan, would a Hyundai Department Store gift certificate be better?
Since Daejeon is close, Galleria would be better
Kiki, by the way, a Hyundai Department Store just opened in Daejeon!
Oh, and I heard that a huge new world opened
Yeah Kiki
My cousin bought my aunt's connections!
Wow, bro, you're amazing...
What kind of connections did you give me?
Now I'm going to buy you a luxury bag!
Awesome!?
That's filial piety
What should I do for Mom... later
Have you ever fought with your girlfriend?
of course
Don't fight over nothing
Kiki I had a fight with my boyfriend today
Kiki, why did you fight again?
Me? No, next week is our anniversary? Our 7th anniversary?
Is it like that already?
Look at the time
Oh, but on our anniversary, let's go eat tteokbokki or stir-fried octopus!
Oh really?
I feel a little strange
therefore
Just a few days ago, we were going to cut meat in Namsan!
I know
If you celebrate your anniversary well, you won't have any trouble later~
Kiki, so
So I hung up the phone while talking.
I know...
I also got scolded badly by my girlfriend before.
Oh really?
How did that happen? Kiki
Oh, I didn't prepare an anniversary gift,
Kiki Ah, honestly, it only happens once a year, so let's take care of it.
Oh, I forgot because I was having a bit of financial difficulties
Honey, I heard you went to a dog pension with Merong this time?
Yeah right Kiki
It was a total party
Kiki, really?
Does he get along well with other kids?
no
Merongi is a bit angry
Kiki, really?
Are you still barking at the kids?
Yeah, you don't even know the topic and you're barking at a big dog.
Kiki, she said she'd get beaten up if she did that.
I know,
You know you have a good voice...
Kiki I know,
I'm surprised he's not being kicked out of his apartment.
Yeah, so the two of us went swimming and playing in the pool villa.
Kiki, I see
You must have spent a lot of money on a pool villa!?
Yeah, it seems like a good dog pension with a lot of pool villas.
Kiki, wow I'm jealous
Did you and Merong go and come back together?
No, I went with three friends, Kiki
Oh, right, Kiki
Did your friend bring his dog too?
Yeah their dog is scared and Kiki
Hey, this is my first time going to a billiard hall.
Wow, you country bumpkin, really
Why go to the billiard hall?
Oh my gosh, my friends took me there! Why!
Oh, you didn't go and play pocket ball?
Kiki is right
Of course you can't hit anything else besides that!
How much fun is it to eat Jajangmyeon and play Sagu at a billiard hall?
I had fun playing for 2 hours without even trying Kiki's Jjajangmyeon!
Samgu or Sagu is more fun than pocket ball.
I know how to do Samgu and Sagu, but my body won't follow Kiki
It's a battle of wits too~
Kiki, I see
Oppa, how much is it?
About 300?
I'm 100...
Actually I'm not good at it haha
Kiki, if you're 100, you can fight me, huh.
Oh, it's annoying
Want to play another round?
Kiki Of course
This time I'll bet on Jjajangmyeon~
Oh, I'm going to eat Jjajangmyeon well again~
Honey, don't you want to go to Kangwon Land sometime?
Yeah, honestly I'm curious?
Kiki, right?
I want to go to a place in Las Vegas!
Oh, it's scary there. You get shot.
Kiki, hey, we went there and lost all our money, what the hell are we going to do about it?
That's true
Kiki, you're in the position of two households
Kiki is right
But don't drink the drinks they serve there.
Is it because they're on drugs in America?
Kiki is right
There's drug content in that drink!
It's scary.
I want to try it in Korea, somewhere like Hold'em Pub
Hold'em pub?
What is that?
Is that like a casino?
Yeah, I think so
I saw this while looking for accommodation in Yeosu
Kiki Oh really?
Can you tell me the address there?
I want to go see it!
Yeah I just saw it for a second so I'll find it again and let you know Kiki
Kiki Oki is amazing
Can you play Hwatu too?
Hey, it's like a casino, Kiki
Hwatu... got caught
Oppa, aren't you going somewhere to hang out with your girlfriend for your anniversary?
My girlfriend's birthday is next month. Can you recommend where to go?
Hmm, your girlfriend's birthday is in November?
November is all about the fall foliage!
Oh really?
Where are the autumn leaves beautiful?
First of all, I went to Sejong Arboretum last year and it was great!
Oh, is it possible to see autumn foliage there too?
Or do you know Damyang Gwanbangjelim?
Where is Damyang
Is it Jeolla-do?
Oh right
Damyang is famous for its bamboo forest, but there is also a place called Gwanbangjelim where the autumn leaves are beautiful!
Oh, how long would it take to drive from the metropolitan area...
Kiki: Well, if you leave from Suwon, it'll take about 2 hours and 30 minutes?
Huh? It's closer than I thought.
I told my girlfriend haha
Oh right Kiki
It's dyed a really pretty red there, it's so pretty!
I've never been there before, so I think it would be good to suggest going~
Is the accommodation okay?
Kiki, I went to a really nice place to stay. Should I let you know?
Yeah, okay
Please share this on KakaoTalk
Honey, did you go out today?
Yeah, it was really cold
Kiki, really?
Honey, did you go out wearing a padded jacket?
I only wore a man-to-man shirt with a no-no coat...
Wow, was it okay?
Didn't your ears hurt?
My earbuds almost fell off
I quickly went home
Kiki, thank goodness
Why did you go out today?
I went out to the department store to buy something for a bit~
Haha, that's right,
I should have gone to the department store too, but I forgot.
It's warm inside the department store, so it's cold only when I go out to get in the car.
Kiki, I see
I went out for a bit yesterday and I thought I was going to freeze to death!
Yeah, it's only cold this week, and the temperature will rise again starting next week.
Oh really?
thank god
I was wondering what to do when I go to work tomorrow!
Kiki's trading got cold for a while
Oh really? That's a relief.
When you said it was a cold wave, I was like, oh my!
I also got a cold wave warning text and panicked
What would you do if you were told that you had to pay for the grill at a meat restaurant?
Oh I don't think I'll go Kiki
I'm going to bake it at home
Kiki, that's right
I heard that a meat restaurant put up a price of 990 won for a grill change.
Kiki must be crazy
What kind of bullying is that?
That's why
Even kimchi is sold for 500 won each Kiki
Oh, how's the rating there?
rating?
How could something like that exist?
right
It's going to be ruined there soon
of course,
I'm not kidding, of course I have to change the grill.
I know...
The price of meat is likely to be expensive as well
Kiki ha, this is really how Japan does it.
But that's the culture there!
Our country seems a little different, that's it
I think it will fail if I do it like that
Kiki is ruined
It's already been published in an article like this!
So the name of the store is revealed there?
No, no
Wouldn't I be defamed if I reveal that?
But when I look at people's comments, it seems like they're just talking about the initial consonants
Bro, did you know that there are countries that are currently implementing WithCorona?
Yeah, are there any more besides Singapore and England?
Oh England~ I knew it~
Brain, huh?
Okay~
I'm very interested in the world ^^
By the way, do you know how many confirmed cases there are now?
well
Don't three thousand people come out in one day?
no
That's an old story, but this time 50,000 people showed up!
Oh, that's too much.
You didn't get all the vaccines?
Kiki no adults are more than 70% correct and have implemented a With Corona transaction!
Ah, it has to be more than 80% of the entire population.
Kiki But whether it's 80% or 70%, I think it'll be the same that tens of thousands of people will show up.
I think 70 percent might have been too early a choice.
Kiki is right
In the UK, the ratio of people wearing masks and not wearing masks is about half and half!
I know
The soccer crowd was huge
Kiki, really
I didn't see that, but I saw you at a concert somewhere? You were just having fun there!
Oh really?
The soccer field is full of people and it's chaos
Are you sure you don't want to wax your hair?
sorry
Absolutely not, honestly
Kiki, why,
Let's go do Brazilian together!
it's crazy
Why are you trying to harass my precious?
Kiki, really?
Brother, you say men have to clear out all the forests?
My opinion is different from Sebastian's.
I hate waxing. Never.
Kiki dog laugh
Or let's pluck out the leg hair, the beard,
I'm willing to get laser hair removal for my beard, but why pluck my leg hair?
Kiki, let's really pull out your leg hair
It's all black, you can't see any skin tone!
Am I a woman?
What the heck is that?
Let's choose Kiki or Beard.
The chin should be hollow!
I'm planning to get laser hair removal on my chin.
Kiki Oppa, did you know that laser hair removal hurts more?
Yeah, but they said it would be cleaner
Kiki, but that really hurts,
Would waxing be better?
Waxing makes it grow again
Since I'm doing it anyway, I'll make it permanent
Oppa, I fell down earlier, oops,
Oh~ Nice
Why did you fall Kiki
What? Nice? Kiki
This is really ridiculous
Kiki: So why did you fall?
Kiki, no, I was coming down the stairs and I slipped because of my slippers!
Aren't the soles of your slippers worn out?
Hmm, no, I think the stairs were just slippery!
Oh so your knee is broken?
No, my ankle is sprained
Hurt
Give Kiki an ice bath like this
Then you'll get better quickly
Kiki, that must be it, right?
Luckily I have an ice pack at home!
If you rub that a little it will get better
Kiki oki oki
I'm trying to do some Elsa legs!
Your ankles aren't in good shape, so why are you doing that...
Kiki, I'm going to do that to reduce swelling
Is it getting worse?
no
It's better to just sit and stretch out your legs.
Honey, did you receive disaster relief funds this time? Mutual aid funds?
Yeah, I already swallowed it all, Kiki
250,000 won in an instant~
Kiki, what did you do with that?
I go to the hair salon to get my hair done and buy a lot of things at the convenience store.
Kiki, I'll use it all for lunch too!
Yeah, if you buy it and eat it, it'll be used up quickly
Kiki is right
I ended up using it all up little by little!
Yeah, but it was sweet, Kiki
It's free money ㅜ
Kiki is right
ㅜㅜ But I don’t know if the country’s finances will be okay if they spread it out like this!
That's for later...
Prices and taxes are already rising a lot.
Kiki, that's right, it's ruined
Bro, which credit card company did you get it from?
I use Kookmin Card as my main bank, so Kiki
I see
I also received it with a Kookmin Card!
Yeah, I guess it's because it's easy to write with, so I started writing it quickly.
Kiki is right,
I eat this for a filling lunch these days!
admit
Honestly, I'm glad that Baemin accepted it too
Oppa, I just watched Knowing Brothers and why is it so funny?
Are you still doing Knowing Brothers?
Kiki, you're a secret longevity
Kiki, I saw Yuna appearing this time!
Oh, Girls' Generation's Yoona is coming out?
Oh my gosh, I can't see it
Oh, it's hilarious that Yoona and Park Jung Min are in it!
Oh, did Yuna film a movie?
I came out with Park Jung-min
Kiki, that's right
I heard you're starring in a movie with Park Jung-min this time!
Ah, Kiki came out to promote
Yuna is really pretty
Yeah Kiki
Her face was really white and pretty,
I know
My ideal type is Im Yoon-ah...
Kiki, I have to tell my girlfriend about this~
Even my girlfriend can't refute me...
Yuna is so amazing...
Kiki, I heard that your girlfriend's ideal type is Song Joong-ki too Kiki
Yeah, I see~
We are doing this again and again Kiki
Kiki, that's right, Kiki
But you really have to watch this episode, it's hilarious!
Yeah, I guess I should look into that again
I didn't have time to watch TV ㅜ
While watching Knowing Brothers, they introduce a movie where Park Jung-min plays a transgender. Why is it so funny?
Oh, what was the title of that movie?
I don't remember
Do you remember now that it said, &quot;Save us from evil?&quot;
Oh, just saw that it was popular last year
Kiki is right
I watched that with my boyfriend!
My girlfriend is working so I booked a ticket for her to watch it alone.
Kiki, I see
I saw it at the drive-in theater and it was really fun!
Yeah, Kiki, I heard it was filmed in Thailand.
Kiki is right
But seriously, Park Jung-min's transgender acting is really great!
I admit, it was so impressive
But the content is a bit lacking
Oh really?
I really enjoyed it, but it's number 456, Kiki
Yeah, Kiki's acting was really good
Yeah Kiki
Now I don't call him Lee Jung-jae anymore, and it's easier to just say 456
admit
It's so famous that it's just 456
Kiki is right, it's so funny
In foreign countries, they asked Kiki how he managed to cast such an idiot.
You don't know how cool Brother Jeongjae is, so you're saying that.
Do you like fruits?
Something like an apple or watermelon?
I really like fruit
Then what fruit do you like the best?
I like strawberries and peaches.
Oh my, peaches are out of season now.
that's right
I feel sad because I can't eat it these days
Do you like puffer fish or water puffer fish?
Um... of course I'm a water buff
Oh really?
Kids these days like to eat spicy food, don't they?
My jaw hurts when I eat dried pollack...
Kiki admits
Then do you like Baekdo or Hwangdo?
Both peaches are delicious
I admit that
I like fresh peaches better than canned peaches!
that's right
Canned food is too sweet
Kiki is right
But when it comes to hwachae, canned peaches are tastier!
Of course, canned food is the truth
You said you live with your parents now, right?
Yeah, I live with my parents.
Did you say you were studying now?
Yeah, that's right
I'm studying
So you have no immediate plans to become independent?
right
I won't think about it until I get a job
Then, does it not matter where I get a job?
no
I want to do it where my parents are
Kiki, you don't plan on becoming independent later, do you?
Won't you become independent when you get married?
Kiki: But I think it's better to continue living with my parents than to become independent early on!
I still want to be with my parents
Kiki me too
But my parents told me to go out, so I did~ Kiki
My parents won't let me leave...
I envy Kiki,
Your parents must like you~
I guess so
We have to stick together
Have you ever ridden the KTX train?
of course
I rode it all the time when I was in school
But doesn't KTX have a price range?
that's right
The most expensive of the trains
Kiki, how much did it cost to go to school?
I think it cost about 20,000 won for a round trip.
How many times a week did you go to school?
I went 4 times a week, excluding holidays.
Then it would have cost about 80 thousand won a week?
right
I think I've heard it a lot
Then it would have cost almost the same as monthly rent?
This is awesome!
So I wanted to live alone, but you were against it.
Why do you say you'll just pay for transportation and go back and forth from home?
that's right
I can't leave my traces
So I commuted to school
Kiki: But still, living with your parents is better than living alone!
that's right
I missed home cooking when I lived in the dorms
What was the hardest part-time job you've ever had?
It was the hardest when I was working full-time rather than working part-time.
Did you say that's where they plan out meals for babies?
that's right
There were too many rules and controls.
Since it's food for babies, they must be picky about what they eat!
That's also why I didn't allow clothes and accessories.
But anyway, since it's a job where I make food, I don't think I can really do that.
I like decorating, but it just doesn't suit me.
Kiki I guess so
How many months did you work there?
Not much
A month or two?
So you just quit and left?
Yeah, I quit because I wanted to study more.
I see
Are you on good terms with the people you work with?
It was fine when I was working, but it changed when I quit.
In what way?
Have I been secretly ignoring you?
that's right
I ignored you and didn't say anything
Do you know the transgender soldier who was an issue last year?
I know
I saw it in the article and on the news
Did you know that guy died in March?
That's why it's so sad
So sad
Yeah ㅜㅜ
Did you see the article that came out this time?
What article?
Is it about that guy?
Let me know
They restored that man's military rank!
But isn't he already dead?
yes
Instead, if something like this happens again after this person, I'll put him back as a female sergeant!
It's a shame about that person, but things have changed thanks to that person.
If he had just endured for 7 more months, would he be living the life he wanted by now?
If only the country had changed it a little earlier
This friend of mine broke down in tears when he heard the verdict in court.
I think I would have cried if my friend had done that too
Yeah ㅜㅜ
Just hold on a little longer ㅜㅜ
Yeah, that was such a shame
Don't you want to go to a dance school?
Yeah, I used to go, but I stopped now.
Oh really?
How old were you when you started going?
I've been going there since I was in the first year of high school.
It was fun
Did you go to school alone after school?
Yeah, that's right
When I went to school, I had friends and we practiced together.
What kind of dance did you learn there?
I learned girl hip-hop while doing street dance
Oh really?
Don't idols usually learn dance?
But I did street dance because I wanted to major in it.
I see
Why did you quit now?
I quit because my parents were against it
Oh my gosh ㅜㅜ So you don't even plan on doing it as a hobby now?
I started it as a hobby, but I stopped because I thought I wanted it too much.
ㅜㅜ It's heartbreaking
I want to learn now,
But I recommend it
I sweat a lot and my flexibility has improved.
Did your brother say he's in Japan right now?
Yeah, that's right
I'm in Tokyo, Japan
When do you plan on coming to Korea?
Well, I'm planning to go to the military next year.
I see
By the way, didn't there be an earthquake in Tokyo this time?
that's right
Suddenly, there was an earthquake while I was sleeping
Wow, isn't there chaos in the house?
I guess there was no chaos, just some shaking
thank god,
I saw on the news that someone died.
Oh really?
Luckily, I guess it's not you
The subway had derailed from the tracks!
It was really bad, the earthquake was that bad
So ㅜㅜ
When did your brother go to Japan?
I'm 21 and a freshman in college now.
I see
Are you coming to Korea after graduating?
no
I heard you even went to graduate school
Is there anyone around you who is getting married this time?
Yeah, my older sister is getting married soon
I see
Where did you get married?
Jeonju?
I think it's in Gunsan
Is the place where that older sister lives Gunsan?
Yeah, so I have to go early in the morning on the wedding day.
I see
Did you have a bridal shower together?
of course
We took pictures and had fun
Did you guys decorate it yourself or did you rent it?
We rented a pension and decorated it ourselves.
Did you buy and decorate things like balloons and tools?
Oh, I see. It sells well on the Internet.
I see
How did you prepare the food?
I'm a clumsy person, so my sisters did it all.
Kiki, you guys are good at cooking, right?
I'm an exception, only my sisters do well
How do you take your kids for walks?
One of our dogs doesn't like people, so we only let him out in the yard.
Is that toilet paper? Is that Kkamji?
Kamji was afraid of adult men
Oh really? ㅜㅜ
Have you had any trauma in the past?
I think so
Whenever I went out for a walk, grown men would surprise me.
Then I guess I'll only be able to play in the yard ㅜㅜ
It's a mess
I sometimes take him to the countryside because I'm afraid he might feel suffocated.
Kiki, thank goodness
Haha, thank goodness there's a place to play! What do you do there?
Haha, thank goodness there's a place to play! What do you do there?
I ran around smelling the grass
Oh, and I think Kamji will be safe because he has his friend's tissue!
Oh, and I think Kamji will be safe because he has his friend's tissue!
Yes, I'm very jealous and I don't like other dogs.
Yes, I'm very jealous and I don't like other dogs.
ㅋㅋㅋㅋ Then I can't take you to a dog cafe either?
Yeah, I'm very jealous and unsociable.
Haha, isn't that the kid you brought home when he was a baby?
That's right, I was sick as a baby and was always in the hospital.
If you danced, you wouldn't have to diet!
no
I think I ate it often because it consumed a lot of calories.
So, I think I'll sweat a lot if I dance just once!
that's right
I ate often because I danced for more than 10 hours a day.
Oh, but doesn't your stomach hurt if you eat while dancing?
After eating, I did some stretching or light exercise.
Wow, so you danced for 10 hours every day in Korea?
right
I did it because I loved dancing so much back then
Kiki, you seem to have really great stamina!
If you tell me to do it now, I don't think I can do it.
Kiki I still can't do it because I'm weak.
that's right
I feel like I'm going to collapse after a few hours because I'm so tired
So you know how to break dance too?
of course
But I'm not confident right now
Do you have any videos of yourself dancing?
There was something like that in the old days
My dark history
Do you know about Liar Game?
Isn't this a drinking game?
I did it when I was drinking with a friend
Wow I asked all of them and you, the youngest one, are the only one who knows, Kiki
If you do it while drinking Kiki, you'll get caught every time
Kiki I was caught with the keyword bidet when I was a liar Kiki
Vidyen Kiki I had a gaori
How did you get caught?
I got caught eating this Kiki
I got caught because I was pretty
By the way, did you know that there is also a spy version of this?
no?
How do you do that?
The spy plays a role in helping the liar!
I should do that when there are a lot of people.
Kiki, that's right
If the spy gets caught instead, the Liar team wins!
Wow, then it's a team battle
It would be fun
yes
There's the Liar team and the regular team!
I should try it with my friends next time.
You said your house was in Jeonju, right?
Yeah, I live in Jeonju, Jeollabuk-do
Then, are there any places you would recommend for traveling in the Jeolla-do region?
If you go to the Imsil Cheese Festival these days, the flowers are arranged beautifully.
Is the Imsil Cheese Festival going on right now?
Yeah, I painted it with flowers. It's really pretty.
Oh really?
What kind of flower is it?
I don't know
It was painted with various flowers
Is Imsil located in a lower region than Jeonju?
Yeah, it takes about an hour from Jeonju.
An hour?
Then, would it take about 1 hour and 30 minutes from Nonsan?
Wouldn't it take about two hours?
Is there a highway from Nonsan to Imsil?
If it's not open, it'll take a long time.
Oh, that's why I didn't think about going to Imsil.
After hearing your story, I think I should go there sometime!
that's right
Not far from Nonsan
But I recommend it because it's pretty.
What's the weather like there now?
It was really cold yesterday, but now the sun is out and it's warm
really?
I saw on the news today that there was a cold wave!
that's right
It's cold, but the sun is out and it's warm.
I see
I was so scared I couldn't go outside!
I was sleeping at dawn yesterday and it was so cold
Yeah ㅜㅜ
That's why I bought a fever topper!
I'm going to take out the electric blanket now
Kiki is right
Now it's time to slowly become one with the board.
that's right
I should cover myself with a blanket and eat tangerines on the floor.
Kiki, of course
You have to eat until your hands are sore~
that's right
That's the rule in winter.
Yeah Kiki
You have to peel and eat the tangerine while sitting down!
Sweet potatoes are also a must
It's delicious when eaten with kimchi
Oh, I like pumpkin sweet potatoes and chestnut sweet potatoes
you?
I like sweet potatoes at night
Something hard
I heard there's a lot of insurance fraud these days?
therefore
I saw the article this time
Oh really?
They say that insurance fraud is most prevalent among those in their teens and twenties!
Why do young children think like that?
So,
This time they even tried to kill people!
Are you willing to kill people for money?
So,
The recipient tried to kill the insured by turning himself in!
I did too much
I'm scared so I can't go around
So,
Even though she was his girlfriend!
Wow, how heartbroken must that woman have been
that's right,
It's a good thing I barely escaped
Do you know why I tried to kill you?
Why? Why did you try to kill me?
This perpetrator had a foreign car in front of him, and he was using it to pay off his debt!
No, you had a foreign car when you were young?
Now you must be driving a foreign car by paying in installments!
It's so pathetic that they want to kill people because of it
Has the UK already implemented With Corona?
Oh really?
They say our country will do it soon too
Oh, but I don't know if that's the right thing to do, looking at England now,
Why? Are there too many confirmed cases of Corona?
Oh, they say that 70% of adults have been vaccinated, but how many thousands of people are vaccinated each day?
Wow, then shouldn't we not do With Corona?
But did you know that Europeans don't go to the hospital often even when they catch a cold?
that's right
They say hospital bills are really expensive
that's right
There is also a culture of deliberately not going to places in order to build up immunity within the human body!
What if I get a high fever and die?
therefore
When I think about it, I think they implemented this so quickly because they wanted to overcome Corona on their own!
It's a good idea, but mutant viruses keep appearing.
that's right
They say it was implemented from mid-July, but before July there were only a few thousand confirmed cases, but now there are tens of thousands!
I think it got worse because of Corona
Hmm, I guess so
But I still don't know which is a better choice!
Yeah, I'm worried that our country will do it soon too.
Did you say you like accessorizing?
that's right
I like earrings that are big and shiny.
Kiki, I see
Then you will have a jewelry box too!
of course
Pretty things should be organized well
Then do you like hoop earrings too?
I think I wore hoop earrings a lot when I danced.
Then what do you wear a lot on a daily basis?
I usually wear small ones and only wear big ones when I'm dressing up.
So, did you buy a lot of branded earrings?
no
I don't really use brands
So, do you tend to buy things you think are pretty on the street and wear them?
that's right
I bought cheap ones because I didn't manage them well.
Come to think of it, it seems like a busy area, but I think I saw an accessories specialty store!
If you go to Jeonju Guest House, there are a lot of accessory shops on the street.
Oh right Kiki
There are so many really pretty things and there are a lot of pictures of celebrities posted.
that's right
When I'm in it, it's just me, but celebrities are pretty
Have you ever had surgery?
no
I haven't had surgery
I tried it once because my appendix burst!
Wow, that must have really hurt
that's right
When it exploded, the sky really sang!
I also went to the hospital because my appendix was swollen, and it really hurt.
Kiki: Before I was sick, the first thought that came to my mind was, &quot;Am I going to die like this?&quot;
Is that all?
If it explodes, it will really happen
Yeah Kiki
How old were you when you went to the hospital?
I think I went when I was 20
That happened to me when I was taking a class in middle school!
I think I would have been really surprised if I had taken that class in middle school.
My stomach has been hurting a little since this morning!
So you went straight to the hospital?
no
I was going to endure it for a while and then leave if it didn't work out, but there was chaos in the classroom!
Just hearing the situation is scary, but how long did it last?
Have you used up all the disaster relief money you received this time?
I wrote it all down
My dad exchanged it for money
Oh, right, Kiki
Where did you use that?
I bought clothes to wear when I play with my friends.
I see
I use 100% of it to eat!
Really? Kiki
It's a lot of money when you receive it, but you spend it quickly.
Yeah Kiki
I applied for it at Kakao Bank and received it!
It was okay!
I found out about it later so I couldn't apply.
Oh, right, Kiki
Dad, where did you apply for the card?
My family all received it by card.
So you don't know about the card company?
Probably Jeonbuk Bank
I see
Kabang tells you right away how much balance you have left, but some cards don't tell you!
that's right
If you receive it by card, you cannot know the balance.
no
I applied for a Kakao Bank check card and they told me my remaining balance!
I also wanted to know my balance so I tried to apply, but it was difficult.
If you enjoyed dancing, you must have been interested in the entertainment industry!
But I wasn't interested in the entertainment industry, not K-pop.
I see
So have you seen the recent Swoopa broadcast?
Of course I saw it
My old academy teacher came out
Wow, awesome
Who is your academy teacher?
Coca and butter?
There you are
Oh really?
Was the name the same as the one that appeared on TV back then?
It was the same
That teacher's dancing was really my style.
I see
Is Coca and Butter still alive?
I don't know
I don't like survival programs
I see
I saw that the team that Gabi was in was eliminated,
I haven't seen it lately either ㅜ
But when I go to Instagram, everyone is dancing to Supa
Kiki is right
I heard that Noje dance is really popular!?
that's right
You dance well and you're pretty
Yeah Kiki
Noje is filming a lot of commercials these days!
that's right
The ransom has gone up a lot
Did you say you saw Howl's Moving Castle last time?
Of course I saw it
Howl's Moving Castle is a must see
Then, do you know the broadcasting channel called Tooniverse when you were young?
I still watch Crayon Shin-chan on Tooniverse
Oh my, the Tooniverse channel is still alive?
Yes
Shinchan do it every day
It's a jackpot
What episode of Crayon Shin-chan is playing right now?
12? I think so
The movie version is also fun
Wow, Kiki
Did you see Crayon Shin-chan today?
I haven't seen it yet today
I have to see it
Do you watch Crayon Shin-chan while eating too?
that's right
The most fun thing to watch is when you eat rice
Kiki I'm watching Inuyasha these days!
I want to watch Inuyasha, but there are too many so I can't
Aren't there more episodes of Kiki's Crayon Shin-chan?
But I've watched Crayon Shin-chan since I was little, so I think I've seen almost everything
What did you eat for lunch today?
I ate toast today!
Oh really?
The toast is Isaac toast~
As expected, you know a thing or two
I ate Isaac!
Kiki Isaac Toast MVP Toast is the best, right?
I don't know because I haven't tried MVP ㅠㅠ
Oh, then did you eat the special toast?
Oh right
I ate the special and it was delicious haha
Kiki, that's so delicious~
Kiwi dressing is a work of art~
That's right
I wonder how to make it!
Kiki, you can mix it with the kiwi dressing and mayonnaise sold in the market!
Oh really?
I should try it later!
But no matter what, the food you buy with your own money is the most delicious Kiki
That's a real confession
Living is the most delicious thing
Yeah Kiki
I'm toasting tonight!
Kiki: Okay, sis, eat toast too!
You said you live with a roommate now?
That's right
I live with a roommate.
Then how do you guys eat?
If the timing doesn't work out, should I eat separately or order something to eat?
I envy you guys
But it's better than eating alone!
That's right
I like that too haha
Kiki, do you guys have an air fryer?
no
I don't have an air fryer
I want to buy it too
Kiki I bought it this time and it really changed the quality of my life
Should I buy one this time?
Kiki, do you like pork intestines?
Oh I love it so much haha
If you grill it like that, it's crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, it's no joke!
Wow, this looks delicious
It won't work
I need to buy an air fryer
Kiki, I bought it together with my roommate because I was so excited!
Haha, oh, I guess that's how it should be done haha
Have you been on a plane recently?
No, I haven't been on a plane recently.
Oh, right, Kiki
Then, shall we take a boat ride?
No no
I haven't been able to go anywhere properly lately ㅠㅠ
Oh, I see ㅜㅜ
I'm planning to go to Jeju Island this time
Wow, Jeju Island would be nice
I went out to play a lot this time
that's right
That's why I'm planning to go on a weekday!
Weekdays are good and the prices are cheap haha
that's right
Weekday flights are the cheapest!
Come with me later ㅠ
Oh good~
This time, it only costs 30,000 won round trip?
Wow, it's really cheap
Where did you buy it?
I think you absolutely have to book flights to Jeju Island with Jeju Air!
Wow, I should remember Jeju Air haha
Kiki, but if you go on the weekend, it would cost at least 70,000 won!
As expected, weekends are really expensive ㅠ
Did you come back from work today?
Yeah, there were so many people today.
really?
Were you busy today?
Yeah, it's so cold that people are coming in.
Then I'll make you a lot of hot ramen today!
Yeah Kiki
Come eat something...
Kiki, originally I went there to eat~
Kiki admits
I always order something when I go to a PC room lol
Kiki is right
What came out the most today?
Chicken rice bowls were sold out a lot today ㅠ
Is the chicken rice bowl the best there?
Yeah, I think so
Oh, right, Kiki
What is the age range of the guests there?
Well, there are a lot of old men
Don't you come there often?
They're not even letting me in!
You said you had a younger brother?
Oh right
I have a younger brother!
Did you say your younger brother is in the military right now?
Oh, it hasn't been that long since I got in haha
Oh, I see. Do you know when you will be discharged?
Maybe it was around the year after next?
Well, it's in the second half of the year, so it'll come out early next year!
Oh, I think so too
Kiki But I don't know if he'll get a vacation next year!
So, I don't get to take vacations very often these days.
that's right
That's why there are so many early discharges!
that's right
I wish my brother would come out late
Kiki, wouldn't he want to come out soon?
Kiki: Probably so?
Still can't get out
Kiki, tell her to buy lots of delicious food from PX!
Oh, I guess so
I should tell them to buy cosmetics too
Didn't you learn to play an instrument or something when you were young?
I learned a lot of instruments, but I couldn't play them consistently.
I see. What did you learn?
Guitar, violin, piano, something like that?
Oh, you learned guitar when you were young?
Oh, but I think I quit after a month or two
Why? Because your fingers hurt a lot?
Oh right
That's why I quit
ㅜㅜ I see
I also learned guitar when I was in high school!
Oh really?
Are you good at hitting?
No, we have music class, that's included in the practical exam!
Wow, that's amazing
I think it would be good if I learned it at school too
Don't they teach at least one instrument in school?
Uh... I learned the recorder, right?
Isn't the Kiki recorder the safest?
Well then, it's easy so that's why
What does your father do now?
My dad just goes to work and works as an office worker.
Then you must have worked there for a long time!
that's right
Has it been over ten years?
Wow! How far is it from your house to work?
I think it will take about 20 minutes
Have you ever been to the company your father works for?
No Kiki
I've never been there ㅠ
I used to go to the post office often because my dad was a postman!
Wow, that would be nice
I want to go too
Kiki: Nothing special, just the duty room, so we played there!
Wow, that sounds good?
Yeah Kiki
But now my dad is about to retire!
Oh, I think my dad will retire soon too.
Kiki, what are you going to do when your father retires?
I think I'll rest at home for now
Did you say you have a boyfriend now?
No, I don't have a boyfriend ㅠㅠ
Are there any friends you're interested in these days?
I don't see people like that these days...
Why do I feel like my love cells are dead?
Oh, I think it would be better to just watch a drama
Kiki, these days, Kim Seon-ho is no joke!?
Yeah, the sea village chachacha was so much fun
Kiki, that's right, I really hope you date Shin Min-a!
I admit, they really suit each other so well ㅠㅠ
Kiki is right
But Shin Min-a is dating Kim Woo-bin.
that's right...
So, I hope Kim Seon-ho meets a good person soon.
Kiki, that's right, someone like me~
You really have no conscience?!
No, that's not it~
But I like Song Joong-ki better
That's right, originally there was a separate favorite
You said that there are no dogs or cats at your parents' house, right?
Hey, I don't grow anything!
Did you say you have a fur allergy?
no
I don't have any allergies haha
So, when you become independent later, do you want to raise children?
no
I don't want to raise it
You don't like animals very much?
I like it so much, but I don't want to raise it because its lifespan is shorter than mine.
What about turtles then?
They say it lives for about 100 years!
I think the turtle will grow well on its own even if I don't raise it.
But I still feel like there's something alive inside the house!
no
There is a very large creature living next to me,
Kiki, are you talking about your roommate?
Kiki is right
It's such a big creature
Kiki, are you raising that creature right now?
You could say that to a certain extent!
Aren't you exercising these days?
I have to do it, but I keep not doing it...
Kiki I was planning on riding a bike this time, but the weather didn't allow me to do it!
Oh right
It was so hot last week and it's so cold this week.
So,
I was going to ride it when it got a little cooler, but it got too chilly!
That's right, that's right
The weather is so unpredictable ㅠ
Yeah ㅜㅜ
I was going to ride my bike after work!
If I ride a bike in this weather, my hands will tear...
Will only my hands get torn?
My eardrums will also go out?
How about we postpone our exercise until next time?
Kiki: Oh, but I'm too fat to do that!
I will endure the sting and escape the cold.
Kiki, if you lie down all the time, your back will hurt!
That's true
Then I guess I'll try home training haha
Oh good
There are a lot of good videos on YouTube!
that's right
But I'm not good at following along
Have you ever thrown a dart?
Oh, then I tried throwing a dart!
Oh really?
Where have you tried it?
I tried it at the dartboard in the bar and also at the arcade!
Oh my gosh Kiki
Are you good at throwing darts?
no
If it just sticks, you're lucky!
Kiki me too Kiki
Do you know how they score that?
Huh? Aren't you just giving points for things that stick?
Well, that's true too!
I think I'll get 200 points?
Oh, I don't know...
I think it was a low score
Kiki, that's a perfect score of a thousand as far as I know?
You can get 1000 points?
That's great
I know that if you hit the center, you get 100 points!
Oh, the middle one has a really high score
Yeah Kiki
But I got 200 points Kiki
What, it seems like you're doing well
Have you seen the drama Moon Lovers?
Are you talking about Scarlet Heart Ryeo?
Oh right
IU and Lee Jun Ki are in it!
Oh, I saw it, but I didn't see the end properly ㅠ I was so sad
You'll cry when you see the last episode
By the way, I heard there was a place in Suwon where they filmed Moon Lovers?
Oh really?
Where can I find something like that?
Hey, you know where the princes play? There's a pond!
Oh, I know
Is this where we sang happy birthday?
Oh right
There's a place there where kids drink!
Hey, where is that?
I heard that temple is in Suwon!
Wow, that's amazing. Can I go there too?
Yeah you can go!
If you go there in the evening, it's really pretty!
Wow, I should go there too!
Kiki, I'm looking at the map finder right now too!
Kiki, meet me there later!
What did you wear to work today?
I went out wearing short sleeves and a sweatshirt today.
Hey, isn't it cold in this weather with short sleeves?
It was really cold
But I can't help it because it's uncomfortable to work with ㅠ
Kiki Oh my gosh ㅜㅜ I'd rather go out wearing a padded jacket!
So I really should have done that ㅠㅠ
Was it very windy outside today?
Oh, it was so windy and cold.
Then now I need to get a warm scarf!
So I think this winter is going to be really cold
Kiki Ha, it's mid-October and all the fallen leaves are frozen!
Wow, I guess I'll freeze before I even fall down ㅠ
Kiki, that's right
But wasn't the sunlight bright earlier?
Oh, the sunlight is nice
So I think it's best to watch it indoors
Kiki opened the window for a moment and the air was cold but the sun was shining brightly.
Yeah, yeah
I should lie down under the blanket
This time, someone died after getting vaccinated again.
Oh, so I'm so scared ㅠㅠ
Did you say you got vaccinated?
Oh my, I got Moderna too ㅠㅠ
Oh right
I heard this guy got Moderna too!
That's why it's more scary
I'm a father in my 30s, what should I do with my children?
So, shouldn't there be some kind of compensation for this?
that's right
Have you gotten to the second round yet?
no
I only got the first one, but the second one is so scary
Have you made an appointment for your second shot?
Yeah, I put it back for three weeks!
Phew, it should be okay, but this guy couldn't even do anything,
So, it's really a bit sad...
Yeah ㅜㅜ
When will a safe vaccine be available?
I wish my words came out quickly ㅠ
I saw an article a few days ago about how much it costs to make Ogame.
Oh, I think I saw that too!
But this is the deal leaked by a Netflix official!
Why did that person leak it?
I have a grievance with the Netflix corporate structure and such a deal!
Oh really?
I think I saw it like that before
that's right
I don't think you should leak confidential information just because you're dissatisfied!
So how are you going to handle it later?
That guy's reputation is so bad that I don't think he'll be able to get a job in that industry!
I think I would go around talking too
You think I'm going to go around talking? Why,
I'm the person involved and I got hurt because of that person talking ㅠㅠ
Oh, that's what it is
By the way, with a production cost of 25.4 billion, Ogame really hit the jackpot!
That must have made a lot of money!
I'm sure I've earned hundreds of billions in personal finances?
Wow, you really earned a lot!
Have you ever had a pedicure?
no
I've never had a pedicure before!
So have you ever tried nail art?
Oh, but I don't do it well because my nails are weak ㅠ
I see
Don't you use nail hardener?
Yeah yeah I keep forgetting to apply it because I bought it ㅠ
Kiki, these days, the pasting is really good!
Oh right
That's why I'm going to buy it this time
Oh, that's really popular these days because you can get really pretty designs without having to do your nails!
Yeah, my friends have a lot of those too
that's right
The method of doing it is also very simple!
Yeah, yeah, I think it's good for people like me who forget things.
Kiki, that's why I bought it this time and put it on my toenails!
Oh, it seems like a good thing to put on your feet, but feet are hard to take care of!
Oh right
When I wear sandals, my bare feet feel a bit weird so I tried attaching them and they were fine!
I'll try a pedicure this time too
Do you like alcohol?
Oh, I really like alcohol!
How much can you drink?
I think I drank about a bottle and a half of soju
Wow, awesome
Are you really good at liver?
I guess that's the case
Not much of a hangover either!
Wow, what a blessed body!
I could go to heaven with just one drink!
Oh my, then I won't be good at drinking parties ㅠㅠ
Oh right
Go to cafes often with the kids!
okay
Well, you don't have to drink alcohol!
that's right
My heart started racing after just one drink!
I also don't eat well these days, so I feel like my health is not good.
Kiki is right
Your belly will grow so much if you drink too much!
That's right
My belly has grown so much from drinking alcohol that it's really annoying
Kiki is right
And if I drink even a little too much, I throw up ㅜ
Sister, you have to drink carefully ㅠㅠ
Did you receive disaster relief funds this time?
Oh I got disaster relief money haha
Where did you put all that?
I spent a lot of money on daily necessities and at Olive Young.
I see
With that, kids buy a lot of watches!
Oh right
But I heard that people who bought it are getting their money back?
Yeah Kiki
Was it because the delivery was slow?
Maybe so?
I think so!
But didn't you say you could buy it at the Watch E-Mart convenience store?
Oh yeah right
So people lined up to buy it
Wow, awesome Kiki
E-Mart's sales must have been no joke, right?
That's what I'm saying
There probably weren't many watches ㅠ
that's right
Do you know how much one of those cost?
I think it was a little over 200,000 won?
Wow, wow, even if you sell just ten of those, you'll make 2 million won!?
Wow, that's right, it looks expensive
Was there a celebrity or singer you liked when you were a student?
Oh I liked b1a4
Oh my gosh
Were you a member of the fan club?
No, I don't really like it that much ㅠ
So you just had a bromide?
Oh yeah right
I think I always had bromides
Kiki I was a big fan back then!
VIXX is good and the song is good too haha
that's right
Do you know who the leader of VIXX is?
Well, I'm not sure. Is it Cha Hak-yeon?
Yeah Kiki
The current Cha Hak-yeon VIXX's N Kiki was my love~
Oh, you got it right
Cha Hak-yeon is handsome haha
Kiki is right
There's another member there named Leo and he's super cute too!
I guess I'll have to search it up haha
I really like his voice!
I guess it's because I like VIXX originally
What was the funniest cartoon you watched when you were young?
I think I enjoyed Tom and Jerry
Oh, I often watch Tom and Jerry on YouTube while washing up these days!
Wow, that's on YouTube?
Hey, if you hit Tom and Jerry, they'll all come out!
I should watch it on YouTube too
Tom and Jerry are usually 5 minutes each!
Yeah, yeah
I think it was more fun because it was short!
Yeah Kiki
If you watch three of those while taking a bath, you're done!
That's right. I'm going to watch it while washing from today too.
Kiki, that's a lot of episodes so I'm watching it in different ways!
I don't have to worry about washing this year haha
Kiki is right
I've been watching this for months now!
I'm going to start playing Tom and Jerry today.
I like Kiki
Let's share the fun part together!
Okay Kiki
First, recommend something you've seen.
Does your brother like fast food?
Yeah, I really like fast food!
So, what brand of hamburger do you like?
I like Burger King hamburgers the best Kiki
you?
Wow, of course the burger is Burger King, right?
You know how to eat too, huh?
of course!
Honey, what menu do you like at Burger King?
I only eat cheese wafers Kiki
Delicious
Wow you're crazy Kiki
Have you ever tried a Quattro Cheese Whopper?
huh?
What I said was Quattro Cheese Whopper, Kiki
also!
I like that one the best too!
Yeah, there's nothing better than that Kiki
And the patties there are different from the others
Admit it Kiki is right
Isn't it moist?
For a chain restaurant, Kiki has a really strong handmade burger feel.
Oh right
And I love giving seagrams!
Ahh I just want cola kiki
Coke is the best
Is there a dryer in your studio?
no
That's why I use the self-laundry Kiki
Is your studio close to the laundry room?
Yeah, I'll walk there in a bit, do the laundry, wash it, come out, put it on the dryer, and Kiki
Oh, I'm following that exact pattern too!
And then you eat rice while drying it, Kiki
Kiki is right
I wash while running the dryer!
I can't invest all day there, Kiki
Saving time
Right Kiki?
Let me tell you a good way
Oh, what's your honey team?
huh!
If you set the time to 30 minutes, you'll be out about 10 minutes late!
Oh, you mean the dryer?
So you're saying that it'll dry out even more with that heat?
Oh, that's right, the residual heat helps dry it faster and better!
But what if the next person takes mine in the meantime?
Kiki, then there's nothing I can do about it~
Then I guess I can't stop talking and I'll go home Kiki
Just turn it for 40 minutes Kiki
Oppa, you said you were sometimes dispatched to other regions!
Yeah, sometimes I go to the area next door and stuff. Kiki
Then should I take the highway or just the national road?
You can go on national roads, but if you want to go fast, take the highway.
So the company will pay all the tolls?
No, they don't provide transportation support Kiki
Wow, so does that mean it's all included in the salary?
Sometimes the people in charge of the site take care of it, but other than that, there's nothing else.
Oh my gosh ㅜㅜ
How much is the toll on the moon?
I don't really care about that, Kiki
There will probably be more of that than expected?
It's not cheap to just get into a car, Kiki
Yeah ㅜㅜ
I need to get my car repaired more often!
that's right
I drive long distances and sometimes things like that, so I change the engine oil often.
I guess so
Engine oil prices aren't cheap either.
I think the maintenance costs themselves are really high lol
Oppa, did you ever work part-time when you were in high school?
Yeah I worked at a gas station Kiki
Gas station part-time job?
Isn't that hard?
Oh but it was fun doing it with the kids Kiki
What was the hourly wage back then?
6 thousand won?
Was it 5 thousand won at that time?
I remember it like that
So how many friends did you do it with?
We did it with 2 people, but the kids came over to play Kiki
Kiki said it was fun because it was like shooting a gun!
that's right
That's why everyone says that when you shoot a gun, Kiki
Kiki is right
Did you also clean the windows of the cars coming out of the car wash?
No, I'm not like that, I just pumped gas Kiki
why?
I heard that there are people who sometimes give you pocket money if you do that?
It's lucky to meet them Kiki
I have never seen it
Kiki But usually, people like that would be the ones who wash their cars by hand, right?
No, I don't think washing your hands will get you more of a tip, Kiki
Oppa, was your military uniform frog-colored?
Yeah right I was a frog Kiki
Have you seen military uniforms lately?
Isn't this better than before?
no
I like frogs better?
Kiki, really?
I guess it's because I only saw the military uniform that Song Joong-ki was wearing~
But they say the one that came out now is better Kiki
Kiki, I see
Oppa, after you were discharged from the military, you plotted treason?
Oh, then that's a must
You upload pictures while doing that, Kiki
Kiki, why are you doing that?
Where did it start?
well
It was popular at the time so I just did it too Kiki
It's funny when I look at it now
Did you decorate it nicely and give it to your girlfriend?
No, if you have a girlfriend, give it to me or not Kiki
Kiki okay~
Then you must have left it at home?
It's hard to even find where it is Kiki
Kiki, but isn't there a time when you have to wear your military uniform?
We borrowed each other's stuff and went and did that Kiki
Oppa, I heard your older sister used Mr. Yoon's study materials?
Oh yeah Kiki
I took a free class back then, Kiki
Did your older sister teach you?
No, I was a baby too, so I just sat next to my sister when she was listening.
Oh right Kiki
By the way, did you study next to oppa? Kiki
No, that's not okay Kiki
Thinking back, it was bad, but at the time, I wanted to play with my older sister again, so I kept going and disturbing her.
Kiki, how many hours does that usually take?
Well, when I was young I had no sense of time and every morning Kiki gave me a wake-up call.
Kiki oh my gosh
How do you do it?
Kiki called me in the morning and we had a brief conversation in English for about 5 minutes.
Wow, I was able to have an English conversation with Teacher Kiki at that time?
No, I didn't do it, the student was my older sister, so my older sister called Kiki
So, are you good at English now?
No, I didn't speak English back then so I don't know anything now Kiki
Kiki, I guess you have to keep practicing English conversation!
Yes, it seems important to review so that you don't forget Kiki
Aren't your family members going on a family trip?
no
We've never been on a family trip.
Oh really?
why?
Are you all busy?
When I was little, I didn't really like my dad going anywhere. Kiki
Then, doesn't your mother like traveling too?
Since my dad doesn't go out, he just stays there without saying anything ㅠㅠ
Oh my gosh ㅜㅜ
Now that my brother is an adult, I will take care of him!
I also work, so my schedule doesn't allow me to go now ㅠㅠ
Oh my gosh ㅜㅜ
Oppa, your family doesn't give you vacation?
No vacation...
We just have a day off when it rains Kiki
Oh my gosh ㅜㅜ
Mom, do you go hiking or something?
No, I just hang out with friends and sometimes go out to other places to play.
That's really fortunate
Even if traveling is a hassle, you should go at least once!
But now my father says he regrets not going before Kiki
Oppa, when you have free time, plan a trip and go with your family!
I'm planning to take Kiki with me later when I have more free time.
Is your older sister married now?
Yeah, I'm married now and enjoying my honeymoon Kiki
You said you got married last May?
Kiki, you got married in May this year.
I see
When do you plan to have children?
Shouldn't we enjoy our honeymoon a little longer?
My friend is getting married this month and is currently two months pregnant!
Oh my, it's going to be hard to prepare that ㅠㅠ
So ㅜㅜ
That's why I sent you the golden apple!
Are golden apples apples with golden skins?
No, it's green with dots?
Huh, but why is that a golden apple?
When it ripens a little more, it turns yellow!
Oh my, this is amazing
Send me one too
okay
I'll send it to you through KakaoTalk~
Oppa is pregnant too~
I think it would hurt less if I just said I wouldn't give it to you, Kiki
Have you ever raised a puppy, oppa?
I used to have two bulldogs Kiki
Wow, awesome
That's my dream puppy!
But I'm so sorry, I sent it somewhere else ㅠㅠ
Oh my goshㅜㅜ
Haven't you had much time to spend with your brother?
I always took him for a walk when I got home, but when I was busy with work, there were many days when I couldn't pay attention ㅠㅠ
Yeah ㅜㅜ
Were there two, one female and one male?
No, they were both guys Kiki
Brother, brother
So did you get them both neutered?
Yeah, Kiki got neutered after he became an adult.
I see
Did you send me to a good place?
Yeah, I sent it to my friend who likes dogs and has a bulldog.
But do bulldogs really snore a lot?
Yeah... I'm really hungry
Kiki, you're seriously worse than most people
Kiki, then I can't raise you...
Kiki, you can't stand snoring, can you?
Have you ever played squash, oppa?
no
I've never done that before, but I heard that there's something about doing it alone these days.
Yeah, that's hitting the wall!
The ball was tied to a string and came back to me.
Yeah Kiki
That's a great workout!
The weather is perfect for Kiki right now
that's right
And this is an indoor exercise rather than an outdoor one!
that's right
So I have to go to the playground and do it once.
There's a building in Nonsan that has squash!
Oh really?
But I'm in Daejeon right now!
Kiki has one in Nonsan, so of course there's one in Daejeon too!
Is there one nearby?
I don't think I've seen it ㅠㅠ
okay?
Try searching on Naver!
If you live nearby, you should consider going there sometime Kiki
As far as I know, Nonsan said it was 150,000 won per month!
Oh, then it must be cheaper here!
Have you ever played darts, oppa?
Yeah, I've done that at the arcade before Kiki.
Oppa, can you throw darts well?
No, I don't really have any talent for that, Kiki
I see
A girl I know says she throws better when she drinks!
Oh, this is awesome
Then when should I drink alcohol?
Kiki is right
When I drink alcohol, I get first place among my friends!
But they say that there is a detail to it too
Don't you get drunk when you drink?
Yeah Kiki
But I heard that girl throws well!
Kiki is really cool
Maybe I should learn it later?
Kiki, that's right
Try learning it once
I'll give you my number!
Oh, by any chance, aren't you the same older sister who broke the dart game before?
No~
That girl can't even throw a dart!
Oh, but you said you would try it and then broke it?
Kiki yeah right
But I hit that spot, which is harder to hit than the highest score in darts!
Oh, you're quite skilled, Kiki.
You should learn that sometime~
Oppa, have you ever been to Namhae?
No, I've never been there
Spinach is famous there
Spinach is famous in Namhae?
Hear it for the first time!
Yeah, when I think of Namhae, the only thing that comes to mind is spinach. Kiki
Kiki, really?
Am I going to Namhae German Village? I heard it's famous!
Oh, that's famous there, Kiki
You haven't been there yet?
Oh, I get carsick so bad I haven't been to Namhae!
Is there no train to Namhae?
I don't know
The car was the best ㅜ
Then, if you drive, you won't get carsick, so go and drive~
But I'm tired too~
It's hard~
No, if you're tired, just change seats and rest and feel some motion sickness. Kiki
Hmm... I don't like either of them. What should I do?
Then it will be hard for you to travel anywhere ㅠㅠ
Kiki, that's right
So, motion sickness medicine is a must when going down to Nonsan from Seoul!
You should always carry emergency medicine with you, Kiki.
Have you gone out today?
no
I didn't go out today, but I'm cold at home.
that's right
Me too, but when I opened the window, the air was different Kiki
My older sister said she already turned on the boiler Kiki
Kiki, really?
I'm wondering if I should take out the longboard now!
Why put that in and just unplug it in the summer?
Kiki: No, that power cord was too tangled, so I put it in the closet!
Oh, then I guess I just need to take that out, Kiki
It's simple
Kiki, that's right
But it's in a corner somewhere and I can't find it!
But did you take it to your studio?
I didn't bring it, my friend bought it for me as a birthday present.
Oh, I have a good friend.
That'll cost a lot of money, Kiki
I'll buy her luxury cosmetics!
Wow, that guy is worth buying, Kiki
Even the one I bought for you costs more!
Looks like you bought me some expensive cosmetics, Kiki
Buy it for me too lol
Oppa, do you watch Han Moon-chul TV often?
Han Moon-cheol TV What is that?
I don't see it
There's this guy named Han Moon-cheol who tells you in detail what happened in a traffic accident!
Oh, are you talking about the black box footage?
that's right!
Have you seen my brother?
Yeah, I don't know if he saved it, but I saw that video when it came up, Kiki
Kiki is right
This time, that old man uploaded a video, and it was a completely ridiculous video!
Why was that video uploaded?
A bicycle crashed into a stopped car, and the cyclist demanded the driver of the car pay for dental implants!
Oh, so how did the verdict come about?
Of course, there is no need to show the stopped club car owner the club video!
But that bike and that guy are so funny Kiki
Did you do that because you thought it made sense?
I think you always think the car is at fault!
That was a long time ago. It's not like that anymore.
that's right
This guy asked me why I left my car on the side of the road!
I guess I left it because it was worth it Kiki
You're a professional inconvenience~ Kiki
Brother, do you know the short track speed skater Lim Hyo-jun?
Yeah I know
Aren't you the one who won the medal last time?
that's right
This guy naturalized as a Chinese citizen!
Oh my, that guy is going to China?
why?
This guy was kicked out of the skating world for sexually assaulting a junior athlete!
Wow, awesome
I didn't hear any harassment ㅠㅠ
In the end, he couldn't work in Korea, so he naturalized as a Chinese citizen!
But wasn't he an incredibly good athlete who won a gold medal?
Yeah ㅜㅜ
But I got kicked out because of this unpleasant incident.
If I naturalize this time, there will be a bloody fight at the Olympics.
Oh my gosh, he became naturalized and changed his name to Lin Xiaojun!
But because the Korean skating world is not good, there are many people who naturalize to other places.
that's right
Besides this guy, there are others who went to Russia!
that's right
But I don't think we can just curse at that
But Lin Xiaojun said it was harassment ㅜ
that's right
There doesn't need to be a person like that
Don't you need something like a watch, oppa?
Yeah I don't feel the need yet
why?
If you do that, wouldn't a job like that be good for you, oppa?
Well, but it's more uncomfortable for us to wear a watch ㅠㅠ
Oh, I see
If you do this wrong, the LCD screen will go out!
Since I use my hands a lot, I get caught in gloves and stuff, and no one wears a watch. Kiki
Then, oppa, you won't wear accessories or anything!
Yeah, I wouldn't even think about doing that, Kiki
Then, don't you wear a watch or something even when you're not working?
Yeah, I don't do that
Kiki, I just buy clothes and stuff like that
Then you don't even wear piercings?
Yeah, I don't think that kind of cumbersome thing suits me, Kiki.
I see
Then, isn't it time for you to change your phone now?
I've been using it for a while now, but it's still working fine Kiki
So is it time for a change?
If you change to a new Galaxy, they'll give you a watch. Give it to me.
So that means you're buying me the cell phone?
Thank you, I'll use it well Kiki
Oppa, my hand hurts so much ㅜ
hand?
Are you sick from typing all day?
No, I cut my finger on the paper.
Oh, there's nothing as bitter and stinging as that ㅠㅠ
Yeah I took a picture too
Should I show you?
No, it's okay
When I look at it, I feel like I'm going to get sick too Kiki
Kiki, you can see all the flesh that has been cut so deeply!
Wow, there must have been a lot of blood.
Did you stop the bleeding?
Yeah ㅜㅜ
I just left it alone because it was a sticky area!
It's hot, so I put on a waterproof band~
How should I wash tonight?
If I put a waterproof band on, won't water not get inside?
But even though I put on a waterproof band, the part that comes off easily got hurt!
Then just avoid that place and try to wash it well somehow ㅠㅠ
ㅜㅜ I need to buy some vinyl gloves and wear them ㅜ sob sob
Yeah, and then roll up the tape and block it Kiki
Honey, did you apply for the mutual support fund this time?
Oh, are you talking about the second quarter usage amount?
Oh, right!
Oppa, do you meet all the conditions?
The conditions are right, but how much will it cost? Are you curious now?
hmm...
He said he would give me up to 100 thousand won!
Yeah, I know that, but can't I check right now to see how much I can get?
Oh, they said it would come out in November, so I don't think it'll come out yet!
right?
I think you're looking at the October usage amount, Kiki
But I can get up to 100,000 won!
Oh, how did you manage to get them all?
I scraped together 3 million won this time!
Wow that's cool
Where did you scratch it Kiki
Yeah, it's a secret!
Let's talk later~
I wonder if I bought a luxury bag~
It's not Kiki
Will it become a luxury brand? Maybe~
Oh, you're going to meet someone in the end, Kiki.
I went to a Monday Kiz concert and I cried!
Oh, when did you do that?
This? I did this two years ago.
Before Corona explodes!
It's a jackpot
Did you sing all the old songs back then?
Yeah ㅜㅜ
That was the first time I sang a new song, and it was called Autumn Greetings!
Wow, this is awesome.
I don't know Monday Kids, I really like this
ㅜㅜ Wow I like that song too
But oppa, should I tell you something that gives me goosebumps?
Yeah, what is it?
Tell me once, Kiki
These days, kids think Monday Kids originally consisted of one person...
Is Monday Kids' Jinseong Lee the only one right now?
that's right...
Lim Han-byeol also came out and debuted as a solo artist...
Oh, that person was from Monday Kids Kiki
Oh right...
And my love in heaven ㅜㅜ
ㅠㅠ That's right
There was a group there
But why is it torn?
I heard that Lim Han-byeol left because she wanted to go solo!
Oh, I see
Well, it's okay since both of them turned out well
Have you ever seen a movie alone, oppa?
Yeah I go see it alone sometimes
Where should I go to see it?
CGV?
Megabox?
Lotte Cinema?
Kiki, the closest place to the house I was living in at the time
Kiki, I'll go watch it by myself too!
I used to go to CGV a lot, but these days I go to Megabox Kiki
There's a Lotte Cinema right in front of my house, so I go there!
that's right
I think the best place is just a movie theater nearby Kiki
Yeah Kiki
And my friend SK VIP came out with free movie tickets so I stole it
that's right
If you don't use it, I'll have to steal it and use it Kiki
Kiki is right
If you don't use it, it'll all go to waste~
If you're not going to use it, I think it wouldn't be a bad idea to give it to your friend Kiki
that's right
That guy gives me 20GB every month~
Are you a gangster?
That guy is such an angel Kiki
Yeah, that's right, I'm a gangster~
He's an angel~
Okay, you can give me something else later~
Sister, what kind of pasta do you like?
Yeah I like pasta
Sister, what kind of pasta do you like?
Umm I like carbonara
Carbonara?
Sister, have you ever tried the one with only egg yolk in it?
Yeah, it's really delicious
Okay then
Kiki, that's a dish that's originally made with only egg yolk, pepper, and bacon!
Yeah, really
Did you make it yourself?
Oh, I can make it!
I can make it
Wow, that's awesome
Kiki, right?
Sister, then you don't like tomato pasta?
I like seafood tomato spaghetti
Kiki ah seafood...
Tomatoes taste best when they have squid in them!
It tastes better with more seafood
Kiki is right
If you add squid, shrimp, and mussels, it's the icing on the cake!
Oh, now that you mention it, I really want to eat it ㅠㅠ
Sister, did you know that it's popular to have a rice container these days?
Are you buying a rice container these days?
I don't know
Then, did you know that rice weevils appear in rice?
Oh really I know that
There's a home appliance rice bin that prevents that from happening!
I should get one too
As a gift
Oh right
That's cheaper than you think!
Where do you live though? Um
We sold that on home shopping.
I bought it!
Oh, you too
When did you buy it?
We've been together exactly one year!
I bought it a year ago
I should buy it too
Oh, I really like this
Highly recommended! Highly recommended!
Oh, I should ask my dad to buy it for me too
Where did you get your car insurance, sister?
30 thousand won car insurance Samseol
Three snows?
Are you talking about Samsung car insurance?
Samsung car right there
But doesn't car insurance cost more than 1 million won per year?
Oh, then I guess mine is my own car
Kiki, are you talking about driver's insurance?
Wingwing driver insurance 30 thousand won
But you really have to get that and car insurance!
Car insurance is 2 million won, that's right
Kiki, our house is registered in my dad's name, so it costs 3 million won!
Oh really, then it's more expensive?
Oh, my dad has three cars in his name!
Wow, I'm really really jealous
No, it's not Kiki...
One is a truck...
A really old car...
Oh, the truck is good too
Sister, have you ever had a part-time job that allowed you to receive holiday pay?
I worked part-time at a pharmacy.
pharmacy?
What do you do at a pharmacy?
I'll just hand out tenten in front
Oh my gosh!
Tenten is really delicious!
Yeah, I'll make some coffee for the grandmas.
Kiki, really?
But do a lot of elderly people go there?
Yeah, there are a lot
Please give me a prescription
What do seniors usually buy there?
Elderly people buy things like Bacchus
Bacchus Poem and Kiki
It seems that Bacchus is the best for seniors!
Yeah, let's buy 500 won bottles of Bacchus each
Kiki, can I buy just one bottle of Bacchus?
Yeah, I can live
It's 500 won per bottle.
I see
I never knew I only bought one box!
I bought a bottle of Um
Sister, do you know that scary place called the barracks camp?
Hey, what's the barracks camp?
When we were kids, going here was popular!
Um, was it something like a retreat in the old days?
that's right
When I was in elementary school, I went to school with the kids.
Oh, have you really been there?
Oh my
under...
It was really an experience center that I still don't know why it was there.
Oh, this is a really tough place haha
It's going to be hard
I even tried the toilet water there...
Wow, awesome
That's a bit harsh
It's really hot summer and I'm not watering it...
Wow really
So did you drink it?
Oh, all of our kids went to the bathroom and drank...
Wow this is really shit, wow
But we didn't have a choice back then...
Oh really
It must have been really hard
How many years have you been attending piano lessons, sister?
I went to piano school for 7 years.
omg!
From how old to how old?
I think I've been going there since I was 6
If you're 6, you went to school until 6th grade?
Um, I think so, maybe
Then, you must have gone to a competition too, sister!?
Kiki didn't go to the competition
I miss you every day
Oh my gosh Kiki
If you go that far, they all tell you to enter the competition!
no
I told him to go out but he didn't go out ㅠㅠ
Kiki, can you still play the piano?
Yeah, you can do it
But I'm nervous and have stage fright
Oh, so that's why you couldn't go to the competition?
Yeah, I couldn't go out
I'm so nervous
Kiki, are you still shaking that much?
It's less so now, but it used to be bad
Does your sister have a nephew?
How many people are there?
No I don't have any yet
I recently had a nephew!
I think it will happen to me too
Still in my stomach
Kiki, really?
Did you find out the baby's gender?
Umm, my daughter is a mother
It would be cute
Wow, awesome
How many months has it been now?
4 months? That must have been it.
Hollang Kiki is still really small!
We also have a daughter!
Um, it's still early so be careful
Yeah, yeah
I know someone who had a miscarriage at 5 months ㅜㅜ
Oh my daughter is really the best
I want to have a baby too
Hey, Kiki, shouldn't you get married first?
Um, who should I marry?
Kiki, who should I do it with!
I have to do it with my boyfriend~
Oh, my boyfriend says he has no intention of getting married.
Sister, what is your ideal type?
I have the same style as Gong Yoo
share...?
Goblin...?
Then, first of all, the height must be over 180 cm?
Yeah, that's right
Kiki's eyes are not high
Kiki, but my ideal type was Song Joong-ki too~
But my boyfriend looks like Jaejun Jaejun
Kiki Aah... Kiki, is that the Jaejun I know, Jaejun?
Kiki Woong that comedian Jaejun
Kiki, then you'd be cute
I just look like a dinosaur...
Ah... it's cute but it's annoying
Kiki is right...
I got braces because my mouth was so protruding Kiki
Kiki, you really look like a dinosaur, don't you?
Kiki Um... First of all, your mouth really sticks out a lot.
Oh, then it's not Yoo Jae-suk?
Kiki Hmm... When I saw it, it seemed to stick out more than Yoo Jae-suk Kiki
Oh really that was too much, Kiki
Sister, does Autumn have a pattern to how she moves when she goes for a walk?
I love walking in the fall so much that I go to the park and the middle school.
Kiki is really so cute
So does that mean Ga-eul has to go for a walk even on rainy days?
You know the Citizen's Park on rainy days?
Go there and do it
Then, did you prepare a raincoat for Autumn too?
Yeah, right
I bought you one
Kiki is really cute
Does Gaeul defecate outside?
It's really so cute ㅠㅠ
I don't poop
So you're just going for a walk and marking?
Yeah, I'm just going out for a walk
My boyfriend, Mongmongi, has to do it outside!
Oh really?
Our Gaeul isn't like that ㅠㅠ
Kiki But maybe it's better to do it at home!
I have to carry a poop bag with me every day!
Oh right, that's right, okay haha
Kiki, that's right, the nga is warm...
A lot...
Oh really really cute Kiki
Sister, have you ever played beach ball with your friends at the beach?
I've done it with my friends too
Isn't beach ball really fun?
Beach ball is fun
But it's hard
that's right
I don't really like going into the ocean, but playing beach volleyball there is so much fun!
I also love the beach so much, the ocean
Kiki, that's right
Sister, do you like playing in the ocean?
It's nice to go into the ocean and play, but it's scary
Yeah Kiki
Then, how many times have you played beach volleyball, sister?
I tried 3 vs 3 haha
Then, if it were a team battle, what kind of penalty did the losing team receive?
Yeah, it's fun to play as a team
Get hit with a honey chestnut
Kiki, really?
We are falling into the sea Kiki
Oh really
So you went in?
Kiki, no, I played desperately to avoid getting in and won!
Oh, I guess you're good at games though
Sister, do you know the game called Rummikub?
What is that
I don't know very well
Oh really?
Sister, have you ever tried Halligalli?
Yeah, I found out
With friends
Then, is your sister's visual acuity really good?
Um? What's your body vision?
Well, this is a game of reflexes anyway.
Can you find the exact same picture quickly?
Ah ah I can find it quickly
Kiki My friend is really amazing. When he drinks, he gets better!
Oh, this is really amazing, Kiki
My friend is like that too
Kiki, why is it that when I'm sober I keep losing, but when I drink I lose so much faster?
That's why
I don't do that, but when I drink
Kiki, when I drink, I get dizzy too!
How much alcohol can you drink?
Me? 200cc beer hahaha
Oh, I really can't eat much
Sister, what do you think is the most important thing to prepare when you go on a trip?
underwear
toothbrush
Toiletries
socks
Oh really?
Isn't the sister card the most important? Kiki
Yeah ㅠㅠ
I don't want to take the card
It costs money
Kiki, when you go on a trip, you definitely have to spend money!
The security expenses are too high
So take cash with you
Kiki, really?
Are you good at issuing cash receipts?
If you have cash, you can see how much you spend and cut it off well.
Kiki, that's right...
So my bank account balance is...
You should bring cash later too
Kiki, that's what I should do!
Let's gather our friends and go together!
Yeah, I'm having a blast with my friends
Kiki is right
Four of us are going on a trip this time. How much should we bring?
I want to go on a trip ㅠㅠ
About 600 thousand won? Take care of it
Oh Kiki
First of all, we are planning to go to Busan for 2 days and 1 night, so I will tell the kids about it!
Ah, Busan would be so much fun ㅠㅠ
Sister, do you like snowball fights too?
Then I like it
I also like sledding
Wow, sled!
Sister, have you been sledding recently?
No, I haven't ridden it ㅠ
I want to go to a ski resort too
Ski resort...
Isn't Yongin the most famous ski resort?
Um, I've never been there ㅠㅠ
Oh, sis, have you never skied before?
Yeah, have you been there a lot?
Oh, I used to go there often because my cousin worked there part-time!
Oh, I'm so jealous
I've never been there
Kiki is really fun!
Go with your boyfriend!
Is snowboarding fun? Is skiing fun?
Oh, I personally think the board is more fun!
Oh yeah, my friends said that too
Oh, you can ride the board better because the instructor teaches you!
Oh, that's true
I should try it too
Sister, do you know a lawyer named Namwook?
No, I don't know
who is this?
This person fled to the US due to speculation in Seongnam and then came back to Korea!
Oh really
Why did you run away?
Kiki, now that you've been summoned to appear in court, you're in your underwear!
Oh, what a funny old man
Can you tell me how much profit he made?
Wow, I'm curious
How much is it?
A whopping 170 billion won!
Are you kidding me?
Oh my god, this is crazy, awesome
right?
In the end, he came to Korea because his visa didn't come through in the US!
Oh really
Still jealous of 170 billion
Kiki But when they saw this guy lose weight, the kids said, &quot;Why are you saving so much money and not even eating?&quot; Kiki
Oh, you really lost weight, Kiki
Don't eat rice
Kiki, so you took 170 billion won and ate it all?
Where to use it
I really wish I could give it all to you
Sister, have you seen the chaos between the Taliban and IS these days?
What is the Taliban? I don't know lol
There's a civil war going on in Afghanistan right now!
Oh really I don't know
Explain to me
Oh, I see
This time, the Taliban and IS had another gunfight.
Ah, the gunfight is really scary
They even carried out a suicide bombing that killed 47 people...
Oh, I can't live there
I can never live without it
So the citizens there fled to our country!
If I go I'll get shot right away
of course...
It's become a completely gray city now...
Kiki is so scared
gray city
Kiki, so
Haven't you seen the photos of the kids who were living in Afghanistan coming to our country recently?
Oh really
I didn't see it ㅠ
They are all children who lost their parents.
Oh, it's really sad and unfortunate
Sister, do you use the hair clips well?
Yeah, I've been using it a lot these days.
Sister, how long is your hair now?
Oh I have short hair
It's ambiguous
If you have short hair, you don't need to use really big hair clips, right?
Yeah I'm using the small one
Even if I use a big one, it all comes out crookedㅜ
Oh really
I guess your hair is long
But I guess I'm not good at using it...
Should I teach you how to tie it nicely?
Hey!
No, even if I watch YouTube, I don't know what to do!
First, tie your hair and roll it up.
Does the meaning of 'roll around' mean to turn in one direction?
Turn it in one direction
Hey!
I tried that though... Hehe
Have you tried it?
But it doesn't work well
Sister, are you taking your vitamins now?
Yeah, eat well
Because I'm old
That's right, you should start eating it in your 20s so you don't suffer later on!
Okay, let's start eating from now on.
Kiki I've been taking it for 3 months now
What about your sister?
I have been taking it for a month
Is this your first time eating it?
Yeah, I got it as a gift and I'm trying it for the first time.
I see
I started taking it because my doctor recommended it!
Eat something like the jelly from the Green Cross
Kiki I am the vitamin that Yoo Jae-seok is promoting~
Oh really
Mine is delicious and good
Kiki I just drink it with water!
Oh really
Is that a pill?
Oh right
You should take two pills a day!
It's your job to eat that too, right?
Sister, what did you buy from Coupang recently?
Yeah I bought slippers
slippers?
Did you buy shoes for the company?
Oh, I bought it for 32 thousand won
Wow... you bought something expensive?
Are these brand slippers?
Yeah, I bought a pair of Crocs.
Crocs?
Did Crocs sell slippers this expensive?
Yeah, if it's thirty-two thousand won, it's cheap.
Oh really?
I've never worn Crocs before! ?
Is it comfortable?
Try one on
Comfortable and nice
What color did you buy?
I have black and blue
Oh, I bought two pairs and they are that expensive?
I bought it on sale
that's right
Kiki, I see
Did you buy one for your boyfriend?
Yeah, one is my boyfriend's and one is mine.
Sister, have you ever been to see a musical?
No, not even once ㅠㅠ
you
I won an event once and went!
Oh really
With who
It would be fun
I went alone Kiki
Sister, do you know the musical Cats?
Is it fun to do it alone?
Yeah, I know
Oh, it was my first time going alone, and it was fun even alone!
Oh, that's really cool
I'll go alone too
Kiki, but I only won one seat, so I had to go alone...
Oh, so that's why you went alone, Kiki
Kiki yeah right
Sister, do you know Big Bang's Daesung?
Yeah I know Big Bang Kiki
why
Daesung appeared in Cats
What a really nice voice!
Oh, I really didn't know
I want to see it too
Kiki But I don't do that now...
It's already over~
Well, I guess I won't be able to see you because of Corona.
Sister, do you like CGV or Megabox?
Yeah I like Megabox
Why do you like Megabox?
I like it there too!
There's a Megabox in front of our hospital.
Kiki: Then of course we have to go to Megabox~
Yeah, that's so good
Yeah I like selling ochan there Kiki
Oh my gosh, it's delicious
me too
right?
And I'm from SK so I get a discount there!
Oh, it's really on sale
I didn't know
Oh, it's 12,000 won right now, right?
If you use this, it's 8000 won!
Oh, I should go too, with my boyfriend.
Kiki's boyfriend's cell phone carrier is SK?
Yeah, that's right
Me too sk
Oh, then I should go and get a discount from the party~
I knew because of you
I have to go and do it
Is your mom cooking now?
Yeah I'm going to make dakgalbi today haha
Wow, awesome ㅜㅜ I should have had dakgalbi for lunch today too!
I heard they even deliver dakgalbi these days?
that's right!
But I can't eat it because the delivery fee is no joke ㅜ
Yeah. The delivery fee alone is 3-4 thousand won, right?
Haha that's right, I gave up because it was 5600 won somewhere!
Oh, I'm alone so I don't think I'll go out to eat.
Kiki is right ㅜㅜ I'm in Seoul so it's a bit awkward to eat ㅜㅜ
It's sad to live alone at times like that~
Kiki, that's right, I called my mom and she said she made pickled turnips!
Mom, you made some delicious kimchi. Send it to me later.
Kiki, so mom said you were mixing rice in it and eating it, and your drool was pouring out.
Do you miss home cooking a lot? Living outside is hard.
Yeah ㅜㅜ
I'm planning to go next week! I have to eat a lot of home-cooked meals then!
Yeah, go gain some weight and come back.
Does your grandmother have an air fryer at home?
No, there isn't any~
Would you like to buy one?
Oh really?
Ask your first daughter!
Should I buy it?
Yeah, he asked me to buy him an oven, Kiki.
Kiki's oven? You're making bread?
Want to make cookies?
Kiki is making a fuss about grilling steak
Why cook steak in the Kiki oven when you have a frying pan!
They say it tastes better when baked in the oven so the temperature is even and all.
Kiki, that's right
But how much steak do you eat?
Right Kiki
Where is an air fryer often used?
Don't you know about Kiki Air Fryer?
I can't live without this these days~
Isn't it similar to an oven? Everyone uses it.
Kiki: Well, it's similar to a deep fryer, but you use it without oil!
Kiki, you use it without oiling it
I guess I'll have to do the dishes
Oh, if you just have aluminum foil, everything will be okay~
Yeah, they appear on home shopping channels often.
When did you get your driver's license, grandma?
well...?
It was twenty years ago when I was working at Samsung...?
Kiki Hey, how many times a month do you drive?
There is no time to say, &quot;I won't do it now&quot;
Kiki, didn't you say you were going to buy a little mom a car?!?
Yeah, that's not necessary now since I work from home.
Oh, right, Kiki
But don't you have to keep practicing?
Yeah, I'll have to get some road training later and buy a car!
Kiki, ask your little daddy to let you practice!
Hey, have you seen that little daddy driving a car?
Kiki Oh, it's no joke even in Daddy's car Kiki
Then~ where does the dog food smell like?
Kiki, when I rode it, it didn't smell like shit, but wasn't there some dirt inside?
Yeah, that's right, and how much do you pay in fines every month?
Kiki Hul, how much do you have to pay in fines?
I've been consistently paying 40,000 won a month
What kind of part-time job have you had, Grandma?
Part time job?
I went to wash the dishes when the kids were little~
Oh my gosh ㅜㅜ You went to work at a regular restaurant?
No, it's a factory near my house, I just did it for a little while
I see
How many hours did you work there?
I did it briefly for about 4 hours~ Kiki and the kids were young
4 hours? You must have done it when the kids were going to school.
I went to pick her up for a bit when she came home from kindergarten.
Oh, I see ㅜㅜ
What was the hourly wage back then?
Well I think I got 5000 won haha
Even dishwashing was expensive, and at that time it was 5,000 won per hour.
Yeah, it's dishwasher dishwashing so I'll give you more
Kiki, I see
Didn't your back hurt?
I should have done it when I was young~
It's hard now that I'm older
Yeah ㅜㅜ
I have a good job now though~
It'll be a good job once corona is over haha
Have you ever thought about sending your little mom's kids to a military camp or something?
Yeah, there were a lot of accidents at the time so I didn't send it.
Kiki Oh my gosh, but why did our academy send me there!
Yes, there was sexual harassment and drowning incidents.
Oh my gosh, sexual harassment?
Was there an incident like that?
The instructors said it was dangerous
The instructors there aren't any experts, and they're just people who don't know anything and do things roughly.
I know.
Why would you pay money to get a fancy dress?
That's right,,, I really didn't want to go, but they told me to go since I already paid 250,000 won!
What is that you're going to pay 250,000 won for?
Kiki, that's right,
But when we left there was another drowning incident and it was a total mess.
If you do it now, there will be chaos. Kiki's moms will never let you go.
Kiki, it's totally ruined there right now, there's no place to do it right now.
Right~ They don't even have military programs these days.
Kiki, that's right. I still think that you really shouldn't do this.
Yeah, that's right. I went because I didn't know anything. I'm not going now.
Mom, is there anything you want to learn besides yoga these days?
Well, I wanted to learn nail art professionally.
Kiki, really?
Mom, do you like getting your nails done?
Of course~
The shops are expensive, so why not buy it at home?
Kiki Oh good, first daughter Maruta go go!
He doesn't like to paint his nails, so you do it.
Kiki, you don't know my nails?
I don't have fingernails,
Potato nails still like that?
Kiki Of course I can't raise you, I'm done,
Why do you still bite your nails?
Oh, I keep tearing it off when I feel anxious without knowing it
What are you ~ anxious about?
If you keep biting your nails, your teeth will also become gapped.
Yeah ㅜㅜ
That's why I have rabbit teeth ㅜ
Yeah, it'll cost money to fix it later, so fix it quickly.
Wow ㅜㅜ But I think it's already too late haha
Try applying nail polish that won't break your nails
Did your grandmother say you were the youngest of your siblings?
Yes, I'm the youngest of 6 daughters and 1 son.
I see
Is there a big age difference between you and your eldest sister?
Yeah, I think there's about an 8 year age difference.
Oh really?
So all seven siblings were born in the same year?
Almost like that~
You kept having children to have a son
Kiki, wow, daebak, but at the end, the little mom came out again~
I know
After giving birth to a son, I thought it would be a boy next, but then I came out.
Kiki wow kiki it's okay the youngest is pretty whether it's a girl or a boy
It's different now than it was back then Kiki
You only prefer sons
Oh, I see ㅜㅜ
So are you still close with your brothers?
We don't talk much, but we talk on the phone often.
Oh, right, Kiki
Is it because everyone is scattered to different regions?
Yes, half of them live in the metropolitan area and half live near their hometown.
I see
How many sisters live in the metropolitan area?
There are about 4 people in Seoul and Gyeonggi.
Grandma, do you think the eldest will get married first or the second will get married first?
The first one will go first, right?
Kiki, really?
I think the second one will go first!
He's still young~ He's in his early twenties
Kiki: But I think you're popular with the second girls?
Yeah. But we're all friends~
You're useless once you get married
Kiki, whether you get married or not, it's all the same~
You have to build your own home there~
You need to save up money to get married~
Kiki, what is the little mom gathering~ Tell the kids to do it themselves~
No, he has to earn money to get married, Kiki
These days, if you don't have a house, you can't get married.
Kiki, that's right
What are you going to do when you get married for the second time in your 40s?
What if I don't grow old and die alone?
Kiki I think I'm going to grow old and die alone~
Why~ You have to marry your boyfriend
Kiki I don't know~ Neither of us have money~
Hurry up and work hard to earn money so that you can get married.
Little Mom, did I recognize the turtle?
It's the turtle song again... So?
Kiki the Turtle only costs 500,000 won!
Are you thinking of raising a turtle?
Kiki, I want to raise a turtle!
Land turtles other than pets?
Oh, that's right, a pet tortoise! One that lives in Africa!
Aha, you raise those in an aquarium?
No, he's not the type of guy who's always in the water, he just needs some sunlight and water!
Then are you raising them outside? In a cage?
There's a kennel and now I have to let them out when I'm there~
What kind of food should I give to turtles?
As for the feed, there is separate turtle feed for sale, so you can give that to him!
I see
I think it would cost a lot of money to raise a turtle.
No, the turtle itself is expensive, but it doesn't cost much to put it in!
But if you look at places like Everland, they even install lights.
Have you ever played tennis, Grandma?
No~ I can't even play badminton properly.
Oh really?
Is your little mom not good at sports with a ball?
Ball games aren't my thing, are they?
Then, when you go to the valley, have you ever played with people and a beach ball?
Haha, don't go into the valley
What fun is there in getting older?
Kiki: Then what can Little Mom do other than yoga!?
Well... hiking... walking, just this much Kiki
I haven't tried any other exercise
Kiki, but hiking is the best with or without oxygen!
Well~ How good is the air when you climb the mountain!
That's right, my first child also likes to go hiking. Let's go together!
He and I have different styles so we go our separate ways
Kiki, really?
How are the styles different?
Kiki, don't stop and just keep going forward
Kiki, who is your daughter?
Aren't you making it too tight?
That's really unacceptable
Do you know Little Mom Casino? It's a game you pay for!
I know~ I've been to Kangwon Land before.
Oh really?
When did you go?
When the kids were little haha
I went to High1 Resort and tried it~
Kiki and really?
But can we go now?
Then~ only adults can enter
Then can we go too?
Little Mom, have you ever played games there?
My little dad tried it before and lost.
Wow, Kiki Little Daddy, how much did you lose there?
I lost 100,000 won and left right away~
Wow, Kiki, you lost 100,000 won in one go?
Yeah, that's right. Why did you do something you couldn't even do?
Kiki, did you play poker with your little dad back then?
I don't remember, but I don't think it was poker.
I see
So, is that the one card you told us about?
That's another card game called hula.
Have you ever been on a boat, Mom?
Yeah, I've ridden it a lot~
I think I rode it recently too
Recently?
Where did you go to play with your uncle?
I went to Geojedo Island for a family trip and rode it when I went to the island.
Geojedo?
What month did you go?
I'm jealous. I want to go too!
If you go in the middle of summer, you'll die of heat.
Kiki, in the summer, you should stay at a pension and go swimming~
Yeah, that's right. It was really hot.
Kiki admit I didn't go anywhere this summer so!
That's right~ Staying home is the best. I just went there and suffered.
Kiki, that's right, I had a great time at home enjoying the air conditioning!
Yeah, that's the best vacation~
Haha, I admit, I have a question for you too~
In the summer, I should rest at home and eat patbingsu.
Kiki is right
But if you eat too much, you'll get a stomachache, so you should eat in moderation~
Yeah, it's only when fall comes that I feel like traveling~
Grandma, do you like winter or summer?
Summer is nice haha but it's long and warm
Kiki, really?
I like winter in summer and summer in winter^^
Everyone is like that~
Still I like summer
Kiki, I see
Then, does that mean your mother doesn't suffer from heat very well?
I can bear the heat, but when it's cold, my body starts to feel cold
Kiki, that's right, it's even worse because the little mom is fat!
Oh my~ When you get older, you'll all agree?
Kiki: But my mom handles the heat better than I do?
Are you feeling feverish haha
A good beggar woman should not be cold
Kiki Oh, that's right, especially when you're on your period!
Yeah, you should dress warmly too. It's cold these days.
Right ㅜㅜ I have to dress warmly when I go to work tomorrow ㅜ
Yeah, wear a scarf with your coat
Oh, a scarf, so I'm thinking of buying one this time~
You have to keep your neck warm so you don't catch a cold~
Does your grandmother sometimes buy lottery tickets?
It's been a long time since I bought a lottery ticket~
I used to buy a lot
Kiki, really?
This time, 10 people won!
Wow, really?
There really is a good place
Kiki: So, everything was automatically selected and done!
Oh, it didn't come from one place.
Yeah Kiki
Should I give you my number?
The first one was 17
I heard there are places that tell you the lottery numbers these days.
Kiki, really?
Are you talking about the spam texts I get these days?
Yeah, there are a lot of people who do that.
Kiki, that's right. I sometimes think about buying that too.
I'll do it because there's a chance it will happen~
Kiki, if I had bought it this time, I would have won 50,000 won!
What if I bought it with the number they gave me there?
Kiki, no, I have a number I've been using!
Ah Kiki, are you going to keep pushing that?
Did you see the process of making Chinese kimchi on Little Mom News?
I know, I saw you make it naked
Wow, seriously, isn't this awesome?
Yeah, so of course I won't eat it if a restaurant uses Chinese food.
Kiki, that's right. I didn't like it to begin with, but after seeing the scene where that old man was swimming, I absolutely refused to eat it!
Yeah, I saw it on the news too
Be exposed
Kiki, really, seeing the process of making kimchi in our country was really healing.
That's right, our country's factory hygiene is good.
Kiki is right, it's really clean, but the export rate is decreasing.
That's a shame.
Soon, even kimchi will be stolen by China.
Kiki Phew, the whole world needs to see what China is doing!
Oh, I make kimchi myself and don't buy it.
Kiki is right
Phew, our country's kimchi export rate to the world has decreased by 11%.
It's our country's unique food, but what if the Korean Wave is popular?
Kiki, that's right, what's the problem? Our country's stuff is much tastier!
That's right~ People don't know how to taste it~
How does your grandmother take care of her skin?
I bought a mask pack and put it on at home.
I see
An older sister I know is giving me a 500,000 won mask pack. Do you want to use it?
Bring me one~
What I have at home is cheap and hard to use
Kiki, I don't think that will suit my skin.
Yeah, my son bought it from PX, but it's not that good~
Kiki, really?
PX is also a good product in most cases, right?
Well, it seems similar since it's sold commercially.
Kiki That's why when I put something good on my skin, it actually gets worse!
I see. Even though I'm older, it doesn't look like it's been applied properly~
Kiki, really?
Maybe it's because I'm intellectual, but I don't like things that have nutritious ingredients!
Then I guess I should only use cosmetics with little oil content.
That's right, that's why I only buy and use cosmetics that are focused on pores!
Okay~
You should start taking care of your pores from a young age.
Kiki, your nose has already become a strawberry nose,
Strawberry Corani, do you want to be Little Daddy's nose?
Grandma, I think I have a cold.
Oh my god, you always sleep with the window open!
Kiki, no, I went out for a bit yesterday and I think I got caught then.
You're going out wearing short sleeves
Kiki No, it's just long sleeves and long pants, but I think it's because I went out wearing them thinly!
Yeah, so did you take your medicine separately?
Oh, I don't feel like going to the pharmacy, so if I'm not feeling well tomorrow, I'll go buy some
Yeah, do you have Ssanghwatang at home?
No, I'm just staying home and keeping warm!
Yeah, it would be great if you covered yourself with a blanket and had a glass of Ssanghwatang.
Kiki is right
And I can't go to the hospital anymore
Yeah~ I coughed wrong and got hit
Kiki right Kiki
And these days, even if you have a cold, they tell you to get tested for coronavirus!
Isn't that too much overtreatment? That's why everyone goes to the pharmacy.
Kiki No, it's because the symptoms of Corona are the same as a cold.
What can I do? Take care of yourself.
Mom, what did you buy from home shopping this time?
I bought mackerel japchae and it was delicious
Kiki Oh Honey How many Kiki's did you buy?
I bought a set of 40 and Kiki gave me some extra croaker
Oh really?
I bought mackerel and they gave me some hairtail for free. Isn't that a bonus?
It's cheap because it's not domestic but Norwegian.
Kiki, but where did the hairtail come from?
The hairtail wasn't domestic either Kiki
Easy to eat with bone broth
Kiki laugh Kiki but if it tastes good then it's a winner~
Yeah, it's convenient because it doesn't get dirty and there's nothing to throw away.
I'm jealous
Where did you buy it from on a home shopping channel?
Hyundai Home Shopping!
This is my first time buying it
Kiki, really?
If it's Hyundai, isn't it cheaper to buy it with a Hyundai Card?
No, they gave me a discount coupon because it was my first time signing up.
Oh really?
What kind of coupon did you give?
Sign up coupon 2,000 won discount and such
Does your grandmother watch TV well?
Yeah, these days I enjoy watching dramas~
Kiki, really?
What dramas are on these days?
Red shoes are funny, mom will see them too
Red shoes?
When is that drama coming out?
That's a drama that airs on weekdays at 8 o'clock. Kiki
On weekdays at 8 o'clock, Mom, I don't watch dramas and I sleep.
You went to bed early haha
Little Mom saw that and went to work
Kiki Right, right? Oh, right. Is it time to work then?
Then are you looking at it as a re-run?
After watching TV, I go straight to class~
Kiki Oh, I see Kiki
Who is there?
I don't really know the actor's name~ I just watched it for the content Kiki
Isn't that actor from Parasite there?
I don't know because I haven't seen Parasite ㅜㅜ
Please search it later
Kiki Oki Okay, I understand. When I get a TV later, I should watch the dramas too.
Yeah~ I heard that these days, everything is viewed on the cell phone.
Does your grandmother like watching movies at the cinema?
I like it, but it's too far to go
I see
How far is it from home?
It takes about 35 minutes by bus~ Kiki
It's not going well
Oh Kiki then I really won't take it
Nonsan has two movie theaters that opened almost at the same time!
Are you saying that a movie theater opened in Nonsan?
Oh, Megabox and CGV opened almost at the same time!
Wow~ There's a new generation there, Kiki
There's a movie theater here, but it's all old.
Kiki, really? Isn't that a branded movie theater?
Yeah, that's true, but it's so old that the screen isn't that good.
Oh, right, Kiki
When you come during the Lunar New Year next year, let's all go see a movie together!
Okay~ Let's go to the new movie theater Kiki
Kiki Oh good good
I'll shoot a movie~
Then little mommy will buy you a delicious dinner~
Oh good good~
I have to ask my uncle to buy me some popcorn~
Yeah Kiki, tell me in advance so I can go~
Honey, when do you want to go eat grilled clams?
I'm off next weekend. What do you think?
Oh good Kiki
Should we go to Daecheon?
Isn't Daecheon too far? Let's go to Gungpyeong Port.
Kiki Palace?
This is my first time hearing about this. Where are you?
It's in Hwaseong-si, Gyeonggi-do, near Seoul.
Kiki, really?
Is there a place there that makes delicious grilled clams?
Of course, we also had kalguksu, and it was delicious.
Kiki and seafood kalguksu are perfect for a cold day like this.
Oh, I'd rather have grilled clams and a glass of soju
Oppa, I don't like soju, but can't I drink it with beer!?
I don't mind beer either, but I like both
Kiki Oh, great! It would be delicious if you put some scallops and cheese on it!
Wow, if you mix soy sauce in there, it's really delicious.
Kiki, that's right, I really want to eat that!
What time do you want to meet!?
Oh, 11 o'clock?
I'll pick you up in front of your house.
Bro, are you holding the subscription right now?
Of course I heard that you're planning to marry your girlfriend.
Kiki, really?
How many years have you been holding it now?
It's been about 3 years, Kiki
After getting a full-time job
Kiki, really?
How much are you putting in now?
I'm struggling because I'm putting in 100,000 won a month
Kiki, but you have to put in 100,000 won each to subscribe!
Yes, they said the odds of winning are high
Yeah Kiki
Even if it's hard, keep holding on for later~ Don't invest in stocks!
Yeah, I already took all that out and put it in the subscription.
Kiki, you did well
Where did you put your bank account?
I put it in Kookmin Bank. It's Kiki's main account.
Oh me too Kiki
I think Kookmin Bank is the best!
Yeah, it's more convenient because it's near Kiki's house.
Kiki, really?
Then it's totally fine Kiki
Yeah, so I went to the bank and signed up in person. Kiki
Oppa, our Starcar broke a lot of money this time.
Byulka, you seem to be sick a lot these days?
Kiki is right,
It's old, it's from 2014.
So is it time to let it go now?
Kiki, no, I can't let you go
I have to keep rewriting it!
How much did the repairs cost this time?
This time, it all came to 180,000 won.
Oh, that's not a lot of money...
But this time, they said they had to fix that place too because there was oil or something.
Oh my, this is a mess. It looks like it hurts a lot.
Oh, I heard that it was 400,000 won.
Ah... I can't help it, I have to fix it and use it.
Yeah, luckily they said this doesn't need to be fixed right away so I'm just going to use it!
Yeah, but I guess I'll have to get it checked out often
Kiki, that's right, this is already the second time I've replaced the battery
I know...
It's hard to go to the repair center every time.
Oppa, didn't you work part-time at a buffet restaurant?
that's right...
I almost died because it was so hard
Kiki, but you met your current girlfriend there~
Yeah Kiki
It's hard, but a girl like Danbi came
You said you came in and were working before Kiki Oppa?
That's right~ My boss is Kiki
amazing
Kiki Oh daebak Kiki
What year did you get there?
Well, I think it was in 2014
What did your brother do there?
I cooked it, it's called Kiki Colpart
Oh, there?
Is this where they make salad?
Yeah right Kiki, the place where you touch cold food
I worked at a buffet too, of course I know~
It was really hellish, the buffet was tough
ㅜㅜ That's right
From what time to what time did you work there?
Kiki, it was full time from 10 to 10
What do you think if your girlfriend goes to the military?
I'm not sure, be careful with Kiki's remarks
Kiki, really?
I think it would be good?
Um, why is it good to go to the military?
Kiki: Oh, I think you'll get some exercise there and get healthy!
But I'm scared because I think women are more absurd
Kiki, at that time, you have to grab my hair and fight~
So I'm a little scared that women will join the military
Kiki I want to try that - marching with a military bag!
Huh? How hard is it to carry 40 kilos?
Shouldn't we be told to lift around 20 kilos?
I think I'll do the same thing
Kiki: Hmm, well, we won't be able to do this for a while since there's no women's bathroom, right?
It might be uncomfortable until you're fully settled in.
Kiki is right
But I think I would go if they said they would do it in 10 years
I'm worried it won't work because of my age haha
Did you do homework when you were young too?
Of course I thought big at that time
Wow, Kiki, you usually do a lot of red pan worksheets!
There were a lot of Kumon, but my mom made me do Think Big.
Kiki, really, what was better about Think Big?
Well? Mr. Yoon also taught English.
I see
I went to a private academy when I was young, so I was curious about that!
It's more fun and boring than I thought
Kiki, do you do that for about an hour a day?
No, not that long, maybe 30 minutes?
I see
But is it true that Mr. Yoon calls me in English in the morning?
Oh yeah it was really disgusting, goosebumps
Kiki, that's funny. So how's your English now?
Hmm~ Hell? Kiki
I don't know... I guess I have to learn it again
Kiki I know a sister who did that too and she said it didn't work Kiki
Yeah lol honestly I don't understand why you would do it because it's a waste of money
I heard your cousin had a baby this time?
Yeah, that's right~
I now have a nephew!
Kiki, that would be great!
How many months old is the baby?
It's only been 3 months, Kiki
Wow, wow, so cute ㅜㅜ
Is it a son or a daughter?
Son, Kiki looks like a total general.
Wow, really? Kiki
Oppa, have you ever actually seen the baby?
Not yet ㅠㅠ I'll just look at the pictures and go later
Kiki, that's right, you're really super cute
Did your cousin say she's 35 now?
Yeah right Kiki
I was worried a lot because I was old.
Kiki: So ㅜㅜ My husband is 40 now!
Yeah, so what if the baby grows up and calls himself a grandmother? Kiki
Kiki, it's okay. Everyone is like that these days~
I see~ Since it's an old mountain, it needs to be managed well.
Yeah ㅜㅜ
When are you planning on having a baby, oppa?
I want to give birth quickly when my girlfriend is healthy.
Oppa, what do you like about your current girlfriend that you're dating?
Well, I'm dating Kiki because she's Park Han-byeol from Kyochon-ri
Kiki and daebak kiki
Does she really look like Park Han Byeol?
Um... right... oh so pretty haha
Kiki laugh kiki
What do you like about your girlfriend?
I like head, shoulders, knees, toes, knees, toes, Kiki
Kiki okay~
I liked my boyfriend because he didn't snore Kiki
Oh, that's why? It's so simple Kiki
Kiki, but now you're starting to snore a little bit!
If that's too tiring, then I should go to the military too
Ha, no, I don't have any wishes, that's all!
Oh really?
You're so petty...
Kiki, that's right
But now I snore so much that I have to block my nose every morning
What if I block my nose? I can't breathe.
Kiki, so I woke up in surprise
You might as well get me some anti-snoring stuff
Oppa, when did you take Merong to a beauty salon?
It was three months ago, so now I look like a wild animal
Wow, awesome,
Merong, I have to make boiled chicken quickly!
That's right, tight hair is fine, but it's going to get cold soon
Kiki, that's right
But Merong likes to wear clothes, so shave her quickly and put clothes on her!
** I have to make her wear a pretty dress like that
Kiki, did you try on the dress I bought you last time?
Oh, of course~
I really like Merong
Kiki, thank goodness
And did you try the cookies I made you last time?
Merongi didn't eat that well
Wow! Why don't you eat that! That's made with sweet potatoes, which Merong likes!
I guess it's because it's dry, but I don't eat it
Wow ㅜㅜ Next time I have to make something moist!
Yeah, cats like wet stuff
Huh? But dogs tend to eat everything, but Merong eats it without being picky, so why didn't he eat that?
Did you have no appetite? I'm full.
Are you good at playing foot volleyball with your friends?
Ah, I'm talking about foot volleyball in the military~
Kiki, what did you do in the military?
I swept away my vacation with foot volleyball
Kiki Oh, can I get a vacation with that too?
Yes, there is a reward vacation for the foot volleyball tournament
Wow, awesome Kiki
So how many days did you receive it?
I'll only give you one day, but I'll risk my life
Kiki But where is the day when I can go to the PC room whenever I want!
Yeah, but the outside air is nice
Kiki, what were you doing outside then?
Of course I went to the PC room and played LoL, Kiki
Kiki Oh, that would be nice~
And then one day later?
That's right, it's slowly melting ㅜ That's why I'm sad
Yeah ㅜㅜ
But now I'm in the reserves~ Good job~
Nice~ Ah, military life is so sweet
Oppa, have you ever played a game called Jjangkangpo?
What game is that?
This is the first time I've heard of it
Kiki, really?
People from Gyeonggi-do don't know this story?
Yeah. But what game is that?
This is a game of rock-paper-scissors, and if you win, you get a token!
Oh, is that the one in front of the stationery store?
Kiki is right
You can use those tokens to exchange for delicious food at the stationery store!
Yes, a trickster has appeared in our neighborhood
Oh, right!
But now that I think about it, that was totally dirty, Kiki
Yeah, we didn't have that back then, Kiki
Kiki, you grew up eating that kind of food, so you were healthy~ Your immune system was strengthened~
That's right, you can even chew on rocks and stuff
Kiki is funny, Kiki even eats sand~
Yeah, I ate grass and that was it~
Kiki, I'm really melting in memories~
Well~ Thinking back to the old days, squid games are also popular
Have you ever traveled abroad, oppa?
Yeah I like going to Japan
Kiki, I used to like getting my passport stamped, so I used to go there often!
Oh, where did you travel?
I've been to Japan, Vietnam, Thailand, and many other places!
Vietnam is good
You like Southeast Asia~
Kiki Southeast Asia is the cheapest~ Admit it~?
That's right, it's cheap and tastes good
Kiki, you're right, Southeast Asia doesn't seem unfamiliar,
Yeah and Thailand looks similar to our country
Kiki, that's right, Southeast Asia is totally my taste! It's so delicious!
Yeah me too Kiki
Pad Thai is especially delicious
Oh really! Pad Thai is really good! I want that and Alimango!? That!
What is Alimango?
This is the first time I've heard of it
Alimango is famous in Cebu! It's so delicious!
Oh, it's crab dish,
The puff pastry curry is also delicious~
Honey, did you say you have to go to work early tomorrow?
Right... I need to go to sleep now
Kiki ha, why did you make me come to work early? I heard it's going to be really cold tomorrow.
Yeah... and they said it was going to rain too
Wow, Kiki, is it raining again? This is going to be difficult.
Did you know it rains all day Monday and Tuesday?
Kiki Huh? Really?
I left my umbrella at work?
Oh, go buy one at the convenience store.
Oh, convenience stores are expensive, I thought you wouldn't come by anymore!
Yeah, you have to pay 6,000 won to buy a plastic umbrella.
Kiki, that's right, the vinyl costs 6,000 won, while Daiso costs 2,000 won!
Daiso doesn't sell 2,000 won umbrellas these days, so Kiki doesn't have money.
no
I bought it for 2,000 won this time?
okay?
Our neighborhood doesn't have it very well
Kiki: I see. Maybe it's because there are a lot of students living here, but it's still there!
Good thing then I'll go to Daiso near the station and buy it.
Wow, did you know there's been a lot of insurance fraud lately?
Insurance fraud, that death benefit?
Kiki, that's right
This time, you tried to kill a person. Isn't that awesome?
Yeah, one of them is in his teens and the other is in his twenties.
Kiki, really?
Was one of them a teenager?
Yeah, he looks like he's in his teens
Oh, I see ㅜㅜ
So they were all 20 years old?
Yes, I did it with an insurance designer.
Wasn't the insurance planner also a friend? That's how I saw it?
They told me to sign up for life insurance and tried to kill me.
I see,
Oh, but that woman was bought because their timing wasn't right.
He had attempted murder before too
Wow, isn't that right? From what I understand, it was done to pay off a debt?
But still, they intentionally approached and tried to kill innocent people.
So, does this make sense?
Oh, right, he said he did it to pay off his foreign car debt.
These Kapoor things are causing a stir
Wow, this time the lottery jackpot was hit in France!
Why in France?
What a jackpot Kiki
The Lotto jackpot is 300 billion won! It's a jackpot!
Wow, give me 100 million there.
Kiki, now I heard that only 40% of taxes are deducted?
That's true, it's other income, so our country is like that too.
Kiki is right
Wow, 300 billion is really an amount that 5 generations can spend lavishly.
That's right... It's similar to America, right?
France in particular collects a lot of taxes
That's right Kiki, we don't even have enough money~
The scale is big. How much was it in our country? Kiki's tax was half
Kiki We're at 30% I think?
Oh my gosh, it's really strong, really
As far as I know, there was a winner in the US last time who won several hundred billion won, and they said they only paid tens of billion won in taxes!
I'm jealous of the young age of the winner
Kiki, really?
I haven't seen your age, but how old are you?
You look like you're in your 20s, I'm really jealous
Oppa, are you using an all-in-one cosmetic?
Yeah, it's annoying so I'll just do it all at once
Kiki, what brand of product do you use?
I'm a little expensive for the rap series
Oh, is that what they sell at Olyeong?
No, I bought it at a department store and used it and they said it was good.
Kiki and the department store,?
Honey, are you using expensive things?
That's all I know
Oh, right, Kiki
Then, oppa, should I apply BB cream?
Sometimes when my face gets ashen, I apply a little bit of it
Kiki Oh, these days there are a lot of men who wear makeup!?
I think it's like BB cream, but not tint.
Tint? Kiki, yeah, let's say idols use tint.
Yeah my friend wears YSL tint
Kiki, your male friend said that?
Yeah right Kiki
They say you can use that because you don't have any lip color
Oppa, do you have good insurance?
Then I have Sylvie life insurance
Did you know that I was sick this time and received treatment?
Oh, you said you were getting acupuncture?
Yeah, you know that's really expensive, right!?
Then, the synagogue fee is 100,000 won
No, the basic price here is 250,000 won. Isn't it really expensive?
That's totally awesome. What the heck
Kiki no but I really like it,
I've been getting healing every day
Oh, I should go there too
Kiki, really go and see
But I haven't been there lately, so I feel like my shoulder is going to break.
Why didn't you go
Didn't you cut it off in advance?
Kiki, no, I have to cut everything off and receive everything, but I don't cut it off Kiki
Go quickly before your hair falls off
Kiki, I have to go but I don't have time, I want to go!
I really need to split my time and use my monthly leave to go to the hospital
Bro, did you say your phone carrier is SK?
Yeah I'm SK VIP
Kiki Oh, then I can get a free ticket to Lotte Cinema~?
They also give out movies once a month
Yeah, that's right!
I think I'll get two on the moon?
okay?
I don't know because I don't use the membership haha
Oh, then reserve a movie ticket for me!
Yeah~ This guy will do it once
Kiki Oh great, I'm going to see a free movie this month!
Do you know how to reserve that?
Yeah, I'm not that crazy.
Then you buy rice~
Kiki, what's up? Bongus, are you okay? Kiki
Oh, I'll decline~
Buy me a bowl of noodles
Kiki noodles? Okay, I'll buy you bean sprout noodles~
No no, with meat soup. Haha, because I like meat.
Yeah~ I'll put squid in the bean sprout soup~
You are really a woman. I really can't understand you.
Have you ever been to a concert, oppa?
I've been to NoNo's theater before
Oh really?
What program did you go to see?
I watched Show Me The Money Season 2 Kiki
Oh my gosh Kiki
Did Mino appear in season 2?
Nono Swings and Mad Clown Outsider Fairy
Then Swings would have won~
Wow, that was really the era of tonkatsu
Kiki, you're so funny. Kiki, did you do a good job with the tonkatsu performance back then?
It looks like a wild boar... I was surprised, but it's good at live performances
Kiki, oh my gosh, how did you know where to go?
I just applied to watch Mnet's Show Me The Money and it worked Kiki
Kiki, wow, back then the audience wasn't the one scoring!
Yeah, I think so, but I didn't get that button because I went too late ㅜㅜ
Kiki Hul Kiki You should have gotten the button and your brother should have given you a score!
It's a shame... I applied after that and got rejected every time
Oppa, let's go see the movie that's coming out next time!
What movie is coming out? It's Moon-Jjin, haha
Kiki, what's going on these days? I heard there's something about voice phishing!
Ah, you're talking about voice. Kiki said it was fun.
Oh right Kiki
Let's go see it. Is it still showing?
Yeah, that's been trending lately.
Kiki is right
But who are the actors here?
They said Kim Moo-yeol was going to appear! Who else was there?
Wow, wow! I really love Kim Moo-yeol~ I really enjoyed the movie that Kim Moo-yeol and Song Ji-hyo were in!
Movies starring Kim Moo-yeol are quite successful~
Kiki is right
But at that time, Song Ji Hyo's acting was amazing!
Yeah? What's the title of that movie?
Oh, I suddenly can't remember ㅜㅜ Should I try it once?
Yeah, let me know later. I'm a huge fan of Jihyo noona.
Oh, I just looked it up and the movie title is Intruder!
Oh, when did that movie come out?
Do you like Jjajangmyeon or Jjamppong?
I like jajangmyeon better
You don't like spicy food, do you?
No, I can't eat a whole bowl of Jjamppong
Yeah Kiki
Can't you eat it because of the soup?
that's right
There are too many burrs
That's why I prefer jjambbong rice
Jjamppong rice is delicious
But I like Jjajangmyeon
Kiki I like the noodles in the jjamppong rice better!
that's right
I think the noodles taste better
Kiki: When I was little, I always ate noodles, but now I've changed to rice cakes!
I like Jjajangmyeon better because I can only eat one bowl of Jjajangmyeon.
Kiki me too
Ah, I suddenly want to eat Jjajangmyeon!
That's why
Tangsuyuk is the truth with Jjajangmyeon
Oh, of course!
If you eat it like that, it's the icing on the cake!
that's right
I like old-fashioned sweet and sour pork
Do you have a dryer in your house?
No, there is no separate drying
Then, does your mother hang clothes on the clothesline and use it?
Yeah, my living room gets a lot of sunlight, so I did that.
I see
Have you never used a dryer before?
Yeah, they say that if you use a dryer incorrectly, it can damage your clothes.
that's right
You should never use any kind of knitwear!
So I'm scared and can't use it
Kiki I knitted without knowing last time and it turned out to be a Mimi outfit Kiki
So it can't be restored then?
right,
It says to add baking soda, but I don't think that will work.
I can't use those clothes anymore.
ㅋ Instead, for things like regular t-shirts, be sure to use a dryer!
I think it would be really convenient to use a dryer.
Kiki is right
There's a huge difference between before and after writing!
They say that using a dryer improves your quality of life.
Can you drive now?
Yeah, I have a driver's license and I've driven before.
Did you get your license in one go?
Yeah, I got 2nd class, but wasn't it easy?
Can't you catch Kiki 2 with your eyes closed?
that's right
But my friend fell Kiki
Oh my god, how did you fail the test!?
I think I fell off the road
I have to see you again
But my friend fell too?
Do you know why it fell?
Why did you fall?
Did you fall off the road?
Oh, there's a part where you have to look back, but you don't look back, so Kiki
Wow, that was too much
Close your eyes for once
Kiki: If you do that, it's not a deduction of points, it's a complete elimination!
Oh, the driving test is really tough.
Oh, he said he came back after only 1 minute of driving on the road.
Oh my god, you fell before you even started?
My heart hurts
Was that daycare your first and last social experience?
Yeah, I don't want to do that again
Oh my gosh ㅜㅜ So when you went in there, did you sign a contract?
Yeah, I had an interview and signed a contract.
So then you went into the annual salary system?
Yeah, I think so, maybe
How much was the contracted annual salary at that time?
It happened a long time ago so I don't remember the details
I see
Have you ever used your annual leave?
No, I couldn't use it so I quit
Oh, I see ㅜㅜ
I want to use my monthly salary now, but I'm busy so I can't.
It's hard to use monthly leave because you have to be careful
I want to write without worrying about what others think, but work doesn't allow me to write.
Is there that much work to do?
Oh and we are so short on manpower ㅜ
It must be really hard
Use your monthly pass at once and get some rest
Did your little brother say he's going to the military next year?
Yeah, I think I'll go around May.
Then when will Korea come in!?
I'll come in around the end of March and rest and go.
I see
But shouldn't you receive the new sword first?
I did it when I was 20, but do I have to do it again?
I guess I should know!
Ask!
I'll have to look into it more when my brother comes in.
I know because my cousin went there last year!
I got this twice!
Wow, I'm going to miss my brother a lot when he goes to the military.
If you can go for an interview sometimes, you can go with your family!
I wish I could go somewhere nearby
that's right
And oh, come to think of it, I don't think we'll be able to meet because of Corona ㅜ
Even with Corona, it won't work, right?
Instead of not being able to use his vacation, why don't he get discharged early?
I think that's good too
Have you ever been to a vocal academy other than dance academy?
I went there once when I was bored and it was fun.
How old were you when you went there?
I think I was in my second year of high school at that time.
Do you remember how much the tuition was back then?
no
I don't remember exactly, but it was cheap
I want to do it too, but there's only one near my company!
It's fun to learn
I'm surprised every time my skills improve
I see
But is it okay if the tuition fee is 400,000 won twice a week?
Isn't it expensive? Fifty thousand won for one time?
right?
It seems expensive even when I thought about it!
that's right
It would be worth it for around 200,000 won
therefore
If it was that price, I wouldn't have even thought about it and would have already learned it!
right
400 thousand won is too expensive
How many times did you go there that week?
I think I learned a lot by going to dance classes.
Does your family have a group chat room with just the family?
Of course there is
My older brother and younger brother are overseas
Have you tried making a group call with it?
Yeah, I tried, but the timing just didn't work out for everyone.
Did you know you can also use it for group video calls?
that's right
I tried that too, but there were so many people that my face came out small.
Aren't there five people in your family?
Yeah, that's right
I think 4 people is enough for a group video call.
okay?
I tried it with 5 people and it wasn't bad?
okay?
I'll have to make it a video call from now on.
Let's set a date and time with our family and meet up!
I think it's a good idea
Kiki's parents must really miss her little sister and brother!
that's right
I often video call with my brother and sister.
Kiki, that's right
The world has really become a better place these days. We even have group video calls!
That's why
Still, I want to be together with everyone
Do any of your friends get married early?
I didn't know, but there were a few people
Oh really?
Didn't you know I was married?
At this age, all married people have children.
Oh, right, Kiki
Don't you put a lot of baby pictures on your profile picture?
that's right
I was surprised when you suddenly used a baby picture as your profile picture
A baby is having a baby
Isn't it really amazing?
right
But I think it's great
Yeah Kiki
My friend also had a baby this time!
I was jealous when I saw a baby picture on the profile picture
Are you jealous?
Do you want to get married early too?
I want to do it when I'm around 28
Oh, these days, people are trying to do it faster than expected?
right
But I want to have a child rather than get married
Kiki: But if you're thinking about having a child, it's better to do it in your 20s!
that's right
I want to have a pretty daughter and raise her beautifully.
Where do you usually buy baby supplies?
I think I buy a lot from Coupang
As expected, Coupang Kiki
What should I buy?
I buy a lot of things like feed and pee pads.
Don't kids get picky about food?
Kamji eats whatever you give him, but not toilet paper.
Don't kids steal from each other when they eat?
Kamji hates toilet paper so much that he steals it
Kiki: Then you won't give me food separately?
Kamji eats everything and covets it
Kiki is cute
How much feed do you give?
Give me one bowl twice a day
Can you give us one and a half cups each in paper cups?
Yeah, that's right
The squid is big, so give me more
Kiki, really?
How much bigger is a squeegee than a tissue?
The original dachshund was a miniature dachshund, but my dog was a medium-sized dog.
Is there any particular exercise you want to do?
I don't think there is anything specific yet
Your parents played a lot of golf. Do your parents play golf?
Yeah, that's right
My parents' hobby is golf.
yes?
Are you two going out to the field together?
Yeah, we go out together too
How long have you been playing golf?
I think it's been about 8 years
Wow, it's been so long
How did you learn it?
My dad learned it while doing business, and my mom learned it after him.
So, do you have a separate teacher who teaches you golf?
Just learn at first and now just practice
I see
I heard your father likes screen golf too?
no
My parents like to go out and do things in the field.
So there is a field in Jeonju?
I think you go to other areas a lot
Have you ever played mafia?
i like you?
I think I did this a lot when I was in middle school
Have you tried this app too?
Of course I tried it
It was really fun
Yeah Kiki
Did you know that it's more fun if you get 8 friends together and do it?
that's right
It's more fun with friends
We even decided on a funny nickname
Should I tell you what it is?
What is it?
My friend's mom's hand pie
Oh, that's really funny Kiki
We named them after the places we live and celebrities!
Oh really? Kiki
We combined nickname and candy
Kiki, I guess what you think now is the same as then
First of all, I was Nonsan Park Han-byeol~
I don't remember, but I remember my friend's so well
Kiki is right
The older sister you know was probably from Nonsan or Yeong?
Inayoung?
I can't admit it
Kiki, please be kind to me since we were students~
I think Kiki had a lot of fun when she was little
Have you ever traveled to Chungnam Province other than Nonsan?
Daecheon?
Is Daecheon Island in South Chungcheong Province? I went to the beach.
Daecheon is in season for grilled clams now
I want to eat it!
that's right
I think I always ate grilled clams when I went to Daecheon
Did you go there that summer?
Yeah, I went to the beach in the summer with my friends.
Didn't the boys really pester you back then?
Maybe it wasn't like that because I went with guys
Kiki, I see
If you go there with girls, it becomes a hunting mecca lol
wow
I have to go there again
Kiki, I should have gone too, but I'm already old,
I'll go back and get hunted again
Kiki, they really ask everyone there! Do you have a boyfriend?
Wouldn't that be fun?
It would be fun to go with all my girlfriends
Kiki, buy them something delicious~
Buy me some firecrackers!
From our first meeting?
It's nice to set off firecrackers at night
It's been chilly lately. Have you caught a cold?
It usually happens around this time, but I didn't get it because I was wearing a mask.
I went out for a bit yesterday and came back with a sore throat.
It's been very windy lately.
that's right,
I even went out barefoot yesterday!
Your feet must have been really sore
The weather is killer these days.
Kiki, I'm already starting to miss summer,
that's right
I hate the cold so much
Kiki But I don't like the heat either!
that's right
I wish it was spring and fall every day
I have to go to work tomorrow, so I hope the sun comes out brightly!
I wish it would stop raining now
Was the rain that came on Friday the last one?
Well then that's good
When it rains, it's hard because the sky is sagging
that's right
I don't even want to bother carrying an umbrella,
My pants are all wet too
It's a good thing it's not raining though
Did you see the article about the person who died from overwork while working XX?
Oh really?
Hasn't this happened before?
that's right,
There are so many people who died from overwork, like XX and XXX.
That's why
The working environment needs to change
Yeah, do you know how old the person who died while doing XX this time is?
How old are you?
Is that what happens at a young age?
that's right
You're only 27 years old!
Wow, you're so young, you died from overwork
therefore,
How hard must the work be for someone in their 20s to die from overwork?
Did XX give you compensation?
I have to do this
I probably would have done it, but the bereaved family doesn't need that.
still...
How sad would that be?
I think it will be difficult
So,
Even before he died, my son said that the work he was doing was poor.
XX has been a problem since long ago, but I guess it hasn't improved
that's right
XX At this point, we need to make improvements!
that's right
How many people have to be sacrificed for things to change?
Did you know that Halloween is coming soon?
Oh really?
I never even thought about Halloween
Right Kiki
You haven't been able to think about Halloween because of Corona?
that's right
Because of Corona, I couldn't think about going anywhere
Yeah ㅜㅜ
But these days, Americans are just waiting for Halloween!
It's a big festival in the US, so should we do it in our country too?
Right Kiki
We're going to have a huge commotion in Itaewon too
These days, Americans have already decided what kind of costume they're going to wear!
already?
I think Americans are serious about Halloween.
Yeah Kiki
Even this time, Ogem hit the jackpot
The number one search term on American kids' sites is Ogame costumes!
that's right
If you go to America on Halloween, isn't everyone dressed up in Ogame costumes? Kiki
Kiki is right
And when Netflix came in, they were like, &quot;No, they're making a ton of products right now!&quot;
I'm going to make a lot of money thanks to Netflix Ogame.
Kiki, this is no joke!
Some Americans have already bought beads!
Kiki said she liked it so much
I'm glad I can promote Korea like this
Kiki is right
Thanks to Ogame and BTS, Korea has become widely known!
It's fortunate that more foreigners know about Korea than before.
What brand of cosmetics do you use?
They all seem different
Shadow is Cloak's
Oh really?
Where do you use your base makeup?
I don't know because each cosmetic is different.
What is the order in which you apply your base makeup?
Apply lotion, sunscreen, and foundation
Do you apply sunscreen right after lotion?
Yeah, I tend to apply it like that
Then you don't have a pre-lotion step?
Yeah, I hate bothersome things, so I only put on one.
But they say that sunscreen is the most important basic skin care product.
that's right
So I'm applying sunscreen all year round
Kiki, I need to apply it too, but I can't because I have too much oil!
So I put on some powder
Kiki, I see
Even if I apply powder, my skin gets oily later!
It's uncomfortable to put on makeup. It's better to buy cosmetics that fit you.
Do you go to the dentist regularly?
I don't think I go to the dentist often
Don't you get cavities often?
I went there last time after a long time and they said it wasn't there
i envy you
Have you never had cavities since you were young?
There used to be a lot of them when I was young, but now there aren't any.
Oh, right, Kiki
But they say that cavities don't occur once you become an adult!
It's just maintenance!
That's why
They say that if you brush your teeth diligently, it won't happen.
Yeah Kiki
But my friend got 1.6 million won this time!
Wow, there really are a lot
Yeah, I got 16 cavities.
That must have hurt a lot
I went to get my teeth scaled after a long time and was told I had a lot of cavities. I got them checked out and they said this.
Oh really?
I must have spent a lot of money on scaling
Oh, so that's why he's working a side job now!
right
Dental costs are so expensive because it costs a lot of money
Do you use any other sites besides Coupang?
I think I mostly buy from Naver, other than Coupang
Can you tell me what you bought on Naver recently?
I bought dog treats on Naver
Dog treats?
How much did you pay for it?
They said it was 9,000 won per kilogram
Isn't the advantage of Naver Pay that you can accumulate a lot of points?
that's right
I feel good when I buy something cheap with my savings
I didn't buy anything, but this time I saved up 5,000 won and bought a product!
When ordering delivery food, if you purchase it through Naver, you get a lot of reward points
Oh really?
Can I order delivery food from Naver?
If you pay with Naver instead of Yogiyo, you get a lot of reward points.
I see. Are you using Naver Pay?
Yeah, a lot
I think I accumulated a lot of points because I used it
Yeah Kiki
I should try using Naver Pay later too!
You should definitely try it
It's fun to accumulate points
You said you were a Monsta X fan?
that's right
Monsta X is so cute
Then did you join the fan cafe too?
no
Not to that extent, but I'm just getting into it
I see
Do you know the singer Park Hyo-shin?
I know
You sing really well
that's right
I joined that person's fan cafe!
And for a fee!
Does it cost a lot of money to join a fan cafe?
no
It's like paying a membership fee of 30,000 won per year!
So have you ever been to a concert?
Is it fun?
Yeah I went there and the voice is really sweet!
I wanted to go to a concert, but I couldn't go because of the coronavirus outbreak.
I went just before corona
I bought it on the black market
It's too expensive ㅜㅜ
I want to go to IU's concert once
Kiki is right
IU's concert is also really good!
And Psy's concert too! They won't let me go home
When you were young, was there any cartoon you watched other than Crayon Shin-chan?
I've seen things like Galaxy Express 999
Isn't Galaxy Express 999 too old?
Bonnie said she did it after she finished it
So I saw it
Kiki Latte saw something like Rozen Maiden, you know?
Rozen Maiden?
What is that?
Are you defeating the villain?
Haven't you seen this fight between dolls?
First time hearing this
I saw something like Lara's style
Ah Kiki daebak
Didn't that come out until season 2 or 3?
I was watching season 1, but then suddenly there were more of them, so I gave up watching them
Kiki, you're probably dating a guy with brown hair?
Oh really?
It's been so long I don't remember
Kiki: I'm also a huge eater, right?
okay?
It was so long ago I don't remember
As far as I know, he's the type of person who eats a lot of sweets!
that's right
He was a celebrity by profession.
Sister, do you still eat chicken breast these days?
I finished my profile picture so I don't eat regular food these days
Where can I get chicken breast?
I don't buy chicken often
Is that something a comedian does?
that's right
Have you tried that?
I tried it once and it was good
There are many kinds of that
Try it again
Oh, the new product keeps coming out?
I think so
I heard you made a lot of money with that
I guess business is good because it's delicious
that's right
There are cubes for that and they come in different flavors
amazing
Everything comes out
There are many other brands too
What else do you have?
nyah
You look for it
Sister, what color is the house painted now?
I painted it white
Is it all white?
No, there's also green, and the rooms are different colors
Did the room give you points?
The room was given yellow points
Isn't it difficult to apply?
It really took a long time to prepare for the move.
Would you do it again if asked?
I absolutely hate it
I don't even recommend it
If I ask you to do it for my house, will you do it?
Go away
I don't have a younger sibling.
Oh, so are you thinking of buying a house now?
I'm thinking of living here and then getting a share
What region are you looking at?
Wonju where I live now
Did you pre-order Casper?
Yeah I did that day
How long does it take?
I guess it'll come when I forget
But is Casper okay after pulling Mojave?
First of all, I need to be able to drag it around freely while walking around the neighborhood.
Are your aunt and uncle driving the Mojave?
yes
I had an accident once and my child is a little sick
I heard a rumor that it squeaks. Is that true?
Yeah, that's why I asked you to sell it to me, but you didn't want to, so I bought Casper.
What makes Casper so good?
Parking, which is the hardest part for you, is now easy.
Oh, because it's small?
I guess so
That's right
Yeah and two years later, I got a job at Hyundai
Are you going to buy a new car with that money?
I'm going to be a slave to Hyundai for the rest of my life.
When I was guarding you, you came to the scene to play
How was it Kiki
It looked hard
I saw it when I was working outside
When there are a lot of people, it gets really crazy ㅜㅜ
Haven't you heard a lot of bad things?
yes
Some people ask about my parents and Kiki
If it were me, I would have really exploded. How about you?
I've never been angry on set while I was guarding Kiki
Then what about the regular customers?
I always sent it to you with a smile
You can't spit on a smiling face
Wasn't your face smiling and your mouth swearing? Kiki
Oh that could be Kiki
There have been many things
It's a memory now
You're good at talking because you had a hard time protecting people.
That's also true
Kiki because I met all types of people from all over the country
Have you been all over the country?
Yeah, that's why I slept alone at my sister's Ilsan house last time, Kiki.
Oh, luckily the house was empty at that time.
Sister, have you ever waited for your boyfriend while he was in the military?
I met a boyfriend who was in the military when I was young
How long have I been waiting for this?
I waited a year?
Wow, we broke up with half a year left?
I think it was 21 months then
Oh, you're old, sister
right
What are you saying?
How young am I still?
Yeah, your ex-boyfriend got discharged from the military?
I don't know
I wanted to be a professional soldier
Where were you stationed last time?
Well, maybe it was the army.
Have you ever met the Navy?
Are you saying I'm some kind of soldier killer?
Wasn't it?
Was it the Air Force, Kiki?
Yeah, it was the Air Force, my brother.
Sister, were you in science or liberal arts?
Why was I a science major?
But you went to physical education school?
So why did that happen?
Physical education departments don't teach math much, but we both liked math. Kiki
You're a civil servant too, but you only studied math?
Yeah, I only studied math during the exam period.
My aunt said you only tell me your math test scores, Kiki
that's right?
Yeah that's me
You're smart, Kiki
Since when have you been preparing for physical education college entrance exams?
I went there from my second year of high school.
What about your sister?
I went when I was in my third year of high school.
Aren't you the one who started really quickly?
that's right
I was number 1 among girls
During the season, there were probably 3 times including both men and women.
It's been a really long time
Yeah yeah but after the college entrance exam, the arts and physical education classes started so I regret not being able to play then
that's right
We both did arts and physical education so we couldn't enjoy it.
Aunt, is your blood pressure okay these days?
Yeah, I was worried because my blood pressure didn't go down after the accident, but it's fine these days.
thank god
Is your uncle in good health?
Yeah, dad is healthy
What are your sisters doing these days?
She said she wanted to be a beauty expert, so she went to an academy and studied English on her own.
Oh, that's great, but neither of us are studying English.
How is your house?
Is your aunt healthy?
My mom suffers every day because of her back pain.
Yeah ㅜㅜ
You had two surgeries?
Yeah, yeah, iron heart...
Mom, you're a strong-willed girl
How is your uncle these days?
Oh, Mom and Dad, I got my second vaccine today.
Did you have any side effects the first time?
My mom and dad said their arms only hurt a little!
That's fortunate
I hope there are no side effects from the second dose
When are you getting married?
Who should be there
Are you doing it alone?
Oh, right
My grandfather asked me not to get married, so I sold my older sister because the upper class had to go first.
sorry
Somehow my grandfather called
Kiki, what did you say?
These days, it doesn't matter who is higher or lower, so I said I wanted to send my younger sibling first.
That's what happened
In Grandpa's eyes, we are now adults haha
If this continues, I'll skip you and me and go with my younger sister or my youngest aunt's daughter.
Actually, you're faster
But isn't your youngest aunt's daughter a high school senior? Kiki
that's right
But I think you and I will go before that
That's not a bad story
So when are you going to start dating?
It hasn't even been a month since we broke up Kiki
When are you going to do it?
Mr. Lee, I'm comfortable alone
Don't lie
Will you be lonely after a while?
But if you're alone, you don't have to report it when you go somewhere, you don't have to ask permission, it's so convenient.
Oh, that's right, that's right, that's comfortable
When will you bring the puppy to my studio apartment, Sister?
I'm thinking of just not bringing it
Why? The kids are coming
I thought they would feel suffocated if I brought the kids who used to play in the yard to my house.
Oh, I guess there is something like that
right
People feel uncomfortable when their environment changes, but babies feel even more uncomfortable
And if I go to Deku, I have to buy all the baby supplies from the beginning.
yes
That's actually not a small amount of money ㅜㅜ
That's true too
Realistically speaking, it would be better not to come to Deko.
Mom just wants to leave the kids in the big house
right
You should listen to your aunt, Kiki
Did you see the tent in our yard?
Oh, you said that was for the kids...?
Yeah... where did mine go
Oh... I guess it flew away
Look it up
I'll go find my tent.
Going to a ski resort and snowboarding?
Skiing?
I'm a board phage
Have you ever ridden a snowboard?
no
I've never ridden a snowboard before.
scared
The board is really fun
Have you ever gone skiing?
Yeah, I went to school for class.
You haven't been to a ski resort since then?
Yeah, yeah, it's cold even if you go out in front of the house to enjoy the cold weather.
okay
You don't even go to the pool
I'm scared of water
No water
Everyone is scared
How did you get your seasonal sports credits?
Yeah, I just took the scuba diving class and covered the theory and took the kids' lessons, and I took the intermediate ski test.
middle class?
Is this your first time riding? Intermediate?
Yeah, I thought I was going to go get some training and then end up like this
Kiki it's difficult Kiki
Did you learn everything from the beginning?
Yeah, but you told me how to get up after falling, but I couldn't get up, so I just didn't fall.
This is a very unique idea and solution.
Crazy Arcade, didn't we both do it often?
right
We played it all the time because it was a game that two people could play on the same computer.
If you think about it, 2P games are actually quite interesting.
It's probably because the game itself is simple to control
that's right
It's fun
Did we do carts often?
Cart but I'm so bad
Yeah, that's right
You couldn't arrive
I like item sales
I'm good at items too
I can't do speed ㅜㅜ
It's fun to avoid items and fun to attack them.
right
The spaceship that only attacks the number one is also fun
I like missiles, aim them and bang
I found water balloons hard to succeed.
You have to control the distance well
That's why I like water rockets
That's the best for getting rid of the person in front of you.
Wow, it's already been three years since we went to Hong Kong?
already?
It was fun back then
Sister Geungkka, you're good at food too
that's right
But you're so incompetent ㅜㅜ
I ate so well
Yeah? Are you really worried?
That's weird
Don't worry~
Just move on~
What was the name of the Hong Kong market?
It was fun going there too
Haggling over prices there was really fun
I can't even speak the language, but I can use body language
Negotiate with a calculator and Kiki
that's right
Still, I bought everything well
I was glad I went there after seeing the reviews at the entrance saying never to buy it.
that's right
There's a price difference between the entrance and the inside.
But there were a lot of things that were secretly interesting and pretty
My sister likes figures, and there are a lot of them, so it was amazing.
I think I did more shopping here than in Korea
We both almost broke our money buying souvenirs.
We exchanged more money, so Kiki
Did it rain in Wonju yesterday?
I don't know because I went to bed early
Did it rain in Incheon?
It thundered heavily yesterday.
Oh really?
Is it raining a lot?
Yeah, yeah, the thunder is like someone turning the lights on and off
Oh, it was like that, but I slept
I don't know Wonju ㅜㅜ
Incheon Seoul is here!
The weather was nice today so I didn't even think about it.
Yeah, I woke up surprised too
It's usually a bit cold the day after rain, but it's not like that today.
It's secretly hot
It's really hot in the afternoons right between fall and summer, rather than in midsummer.
The sun was no joke
It's so hot
I just walked to the mart and thought I was melting
I also went to the hospital and the air conditioner in the treatment room was off so I asked them to turn it on.
Good job, it's hot inside
When is the second vaccine?
I got the first one yesterday Kiki
6 weeks later or 4 weeks later
It was 6 weeks, but it could be brought forward to 4 weeks.
So you got Moderna?
Yeah, now it's all Moderna
I want to get hit with Janssen at once
Isn't that probably starting at age 30?
I guess so ㅜㅜ
It's better to have only one stage than to have two stages.
Is there anyone around you who has had a Janssen hit?
Yeah, there are quite a lot
I'm jealous
I heard that starting next month, people who haven't been vaccinated won't be able to go to restaurants.
Yes, I read the article, but isn't it realistically difficult?
They also said that a petition was posted
It's recommended, but not mandatory
That's true
I wonder why people get infected even though there is a vaccine
Did you see the British article?
Why do I not read the articles often?
There's a fuel crisis in the UK right now.
Wow how does the car move
So the military was brought in
Wow, this is serious, wow
Have you seen the edible coronavirus treatment that's coming out?
Is there something like that?
Is that the end if I eat that?
Sister, did you say Moderna?
Yeah Moderna, why?
Moderna is more likely to cause heart inflammation than Pfizer
Oh my, now all the results are being announced.
Ignorance is bliss
Forget it
After all, you spoke to me so kindly?
Then shall I tell you again?
Shh I'm sorry
Stop
Sister, what color is your hair now?
I'm gray kiki now
Did you do it yourself at home?
Yeah, I bleach my hair myself too
So your head is a broom?
Not anymore, miss
I cut it short
Isn't it Kiki?
How often do you dye your hair?
I've done this every week and I don't do it often
Is your goal to become a broom again?
Why are you doing this to me?
It's an expression of affection Kiki
I dyed my hair too
Did you go to the hair salon and get your hair done red too?
I quit my job as a bodyguard and then as a security guard.
I got a lot of calls calling me to get my hair dyed, so I just dyed it the day after I quit my job.
That's wise
You who can't refuse, have found a clever way
right
I have red hair, so I can't call you a bodyguard or security guard~
There's a rumor that they even threw away their work clothes...
Are you feeling okay now after the car accident?
It wasn't that bad and I shouldn't get hurt because I'm the one who's hurting
Oh well, I hope no one got hurt
Are you free from aftereffects of the car accident?
When I was hospitalized, my blood pressure was as high as my mother's height.
Kiki, did you have high blood pressure?
Did you fall?
He said his illness got worse after the car accident.
It must have been even worse because you planned it out like that and it all fell apart.
that's right
They changed my medicine because I had a serious illness.
And you said there was no window in your hospital room.
The facility is so new that it's nice, but I didn't know that not having windows was such a big deal.
How long were you hospitalized?
It was supposed to be 10 days, but I was discharged right away because I had to go for an interview.
If I'm admitted to a Korean medicine clinic, do they give me all herbal medicine?
Yeah, they'll give you a week's worth when you're discharged.
I can see it without looking
Did you throw it all away?
Sister, did the delivery you were waiting for come?
no
If you check the current location, my package is moving around here and there.
I'm so sad
But why did that happen?
So Kiki
When will you come?
But isn't delivery convenient?
It's not easy to buy online
Coupang is a staple for single-person households, right?
I use Market Kurly a lot these days
How about that?
are you okay?
I think the minimum order amount was lower than Coupang's
Then it's okay
Coupang's minimum order amount is too high
That's right
I also have a WoW membership
Isn't that expensive?
no
It only costs 2900 won
Oh, it's cheap
Are you okay?
Yeah, Coupang is convenient for single-person households.
Who is your favorite celebrity?
I like comedian Lee Yong-jin. Do you?
I'm totally a two-faced person
If you keep doing that and meet Yang Se-hyung, you'll collapse
If I fall, please catch me.
What are you watching these days?
I'm watching The Great Escape, but this week is the last one ㅜㅜ
Is there next season?
Yeah, PD Jeong Jong-yeon said he has no intention of ending the Great Escape season.
Season system could be like that
Sister, do you know New Journey to the West?
I know
I know you're crazy too
It's starting at 9 o'clock soon, oh yeah
It's already 9?
How many times has Lee Seung Gi appeared?
That's totally when it comes out on Naver TV... 1
Tell me when season 9 starts
I want to see it too
Sister, have you seen Perfect Stranger?
I saw it because you told me to look
Are you satisfied? Hehe
It's fun
It was the end of a long road, how many times have you seen it?
That's the first movie I've ever seen twice in my life.
I'm a real fan of Jjini. I'm a real fan.
But now I can't remember Naeong very well Kiki
When you come out of the movie theater, you don't remember the content, right?
Yeah, so I can't talk about the movie after watching it.
Kiki: So, was it just the moment when you were watching the movie that was fun?
That's correct.
When was the last time you went to the cinema?
I really don't go to the movies, so I think the last time my little brother took me to see Frozen was
By the way, you saw Frozen
Haven't you seen it?
You don't like that one, do you?
Correct answer Correct answer
I've often seen it in variety shows without watching it
If you just saw that, you would have already understood
What are you having for lunch today?
I bought kimbap today
What kind of kimbap do you like?
I usually like tuna kimbap, but today I splurge a little and ate spicy kimbap
You're a mapaholic, right? Kiki, are you okay?
It's growing more and more now
Until the day I can eat spicy Yeopddeok
Ha, that's max level, but...
Let's eat tteokbokki
You don't eat tteokbokki rice cakes, Kiki
Instead, let's eat oden. The rice cakes are all yours.
Yeah, I like rice cake better than oden
It's perfect for the two of us Kiki
Yeah, can you add some cheese too?
Ah carrot call device
Call the circle right now
I want to live alone too
Where are you going to do it this time?
This time, when the contract ends and I decide on a different company, I will live there on my own.
A full-price deposit? A monthly rent? What kind?
Now I have to go to Jeonsei
When you lived alone before, did you always pay monthly rent?
Yeah, I paid rent both times.
There are so few jeonse prices these days. It must be even worse in the metropolitan area.
In fact, it's not a penny or two, it's difficult
But you always commuted too far from home to work.
It's always far. At my last company, it took 4 hours to commute to work.
Ugh, I can't do it now?
Uh... It's reduced now, so if you combine commuting time it's 3 hours^^
Wow, one and a half hours one way? Seriously, how do you get there?
It's hard because I have to change trains twice ㅜㅜ
Oh, you went to your previous company by bus?
It's fortunate that my house is located right next to the subway station.
How close is it to the subway station?
The exit name is just the apartment name. If you walk 10 steps from the exit, you're already in our apartment.
It's near the station, so it's probably just a matter of coming in and going to your neighborhood.
Yeah, so when I go to work, I just open the door and wait 6 minutes to get to the subway door.
It's a subway, so it'll take some time to get down to the basement.
Reality is busy running from the morning
Is there no bus route to go to work?
There is a bus that arrives at Gangnam Station, but I still have to walk a bit to work, and there is no red bus that goes to my house.
Are there regular bus routes?
There are some at the main gate and back gate, and at each exit.
The house is conveniently located for transportation.
Transportation is convenient, but it's a bit inconvenient because there are no buses going to Seoul ㅜㅜ
Didn't you take the bus to Hongdae back then?
The way to go to Hongdae, Seoul Station, and Songnae Station is right in front of my house, so I'll definitely go backㅜ
The downside of the bus is that it gets stuck and you have no answer if you go back.
When is the company's first anniversary now?
It will be one year in March next year
Are you going to move? Are you going to stay?
I have to stay. How long is your contract?
It was originally supposed to be until October, but yesterday you said it would be the end of December.
That's great~ Is this your first contract job?
Yeah, I guess it has its pros and cons.
When did the contract start?
May 1st! It's neat
It's one day, easy to calculate.
When is Maja's payday?
We are 10 days you?
It's different for me, I have 30 days!
30 days? It's the first time I've seen it, but it's almost 5 or 10 days.
I also got my first paycheck on the 30th Kiki
Actually, it's good to get your salary whenever you want
How about joining the army?
Who me? You?
Sister, go away without me hehe
I originally wanted to do ROTC, but I couldn't.
If you had come, I would have gone to the interview.
Don't lie, okay~ Hehe
No, I think I really went to see PX
Oh, I admit that
Sister, have you been to PX yourself?
I went there and it was cheap
Oh, that's good. I want to go there too.
I heard there is a PX that civilians can enter.
Don't lie, I'll get shot
Actually, I don't know either
Where are you trying to sell me, you sis?
Let's just never go to Merong PX again
What time did you start school when you were in high school?
We were at 7:30, you?
It was 8:10 for us haha I'm jealous
Wow, awesome, but wasn't the punishment there harsh?
Uh... If you're late three times, you're immediately taken to the disciplinary committee.
It's tough. Then don't the kids get punished a lot?
Of course, you can't even do community service just by being late.
Then isn't that expulsion?
Yeah, but if you get expelled, it'll be hard to go back to school, so I'd rather bring my parents and ask them to drop out.
Wow, that's really scary
I went to do community service and stuff so there weren't many kids there.
How many students were there in the school?
There were less than 200 of us, maybe 20 per class...?
What school did you go to?
Maybe because it's new, Kiki, but it was fun
Fun is fine, school is fine
Have you talked to your grandmother recently?
Yeah, I gave it to you just yesterday
Oh, what are you talking about?
He asked me if I was doing well, so please contact him.
Oh, I didn't give it to you because I thought you'd be annoyed, grandma. I'm so sorry. ㅜㅜ
Why does grandma bother calling you? Even though she's busy, she's happy to hear her granddaughter call.
Oh, does that sound like an adult?
Yeah, I was satisfied just now too hehe
So, did you talk to your grandfather?
If I give it to just one person, they'll be upset~
Kiki is smart, what is the installment plan?
Kiki, you asked if I had a boyfriend so I could get married
I haven't found the principal yet. Kiki, I should call you.
What are you trying to say?
My sister said that we broke up, so I'm sad, so please bear with it~
You are such a good younger brother^^
Where do you want to have your wedding?
Would Wonju be better for me?
Who would you like to sing the congratulatory song at your wedding?
I wish my husband would call you. What about you?
I want to sing, I want to ruin it, I want to ruin it
Should I call you? How about that?
Yeah, get over there, didn't I just say I was screwing up?
That's too bad. Then I'll do the baggage for you.
That's fine, let's do it for each other
Yeah, they say that carrying a bag is the hardest part, but have you tried it?
Yeah I thought I was getting married
Did you say you went to look at wedding dresses together?
We went to a place that was two hours away from my house to see it together.
Where did your husband go and where did you go?
My husband is a career soldier, but he can't go out because he can't jump due to Corona ㅜㅜ
I'm glad you were here
Have you ever raised an iguana?
Hey, why the sudden iguana?
I just had a thought haha have you ever raised fish?
My youngest aunt raises fish
Oh, I heard that managing a fish tank is really hard.
The youngest aunt, Geungkka, was also having a hard time
What was the name of the fish?
Cute, probably slippery
The name is cuter
Are you thinking of raising an iguana?
No, I'm not confident...
What name do you want to give your child when you grow up?
If it's an iguana... I'll name it Minimi
Minime? What's the reason?
I just think it's cute because it's small
Let's definitely reconsider the name
Have you ever been to a sport and watched it in person?
I don't have it yet. You?
I've seen baseball and soccer in person.
Do you know the rules of soccer?
Well, I know it doesn't seem like a big problem!
What about baseball then?
There's no problem watching baseball either.
Which is more fun, soccer or baseball?
I'm more interested in soccer
Have you ever played soccer?
When I was doing physical education for college entrance exams, I played women's soccer with another branch.
Is there such a thing? Did you win?
Our branch and the other party got hurt and ended up together
Ah, since everyone's bodies are built up from college entrance exams, it would be no joke if they fought physically.
The correct answer is that the kids are flying high with competitive spirit
You were just watching, Kiki
Have you tried League of Legends?
Are you talking about LoL?
Yeah, that's right
But why do you talk for so long?
Shh, if you know, have you ever gotten hurt?
Yeah, I tried it once, but you weren't really into it?
I did it once and then I quit
Why? Are you not having fun either?
No, I'm afraid I'll miss it because it's fun
Akiki, you said that and you're into Overwatch, Kiki
Yeah, I like Overwatch better
Junkrat? Is that right? What else is there?
There's Diva, Genji, Tracer, there's so many.
Are you the only one who plays Junkrat?
Yeah, I only dig one
Is he a shooter?
I remember our day trip to Busan
It was possible when I was young
I can't do it now... I think I made the decision in a hurry the day before.
Yes, I left suddenly, taking the first train.
Wow, what did you eat then?
I came back after eating dried pollack and noodles
What? It's the same day and you ate everything you wanted to eat?
It was fast, we were young then so it was possible
I think that was the first time I ever tasted the presidential election.
Yeah, it was our first time together.
The taste is different. Have you tried soju in the Chungnam region?
Oh, now it says we are authorized?
Yeah, that's right. I drank that recently. I drank Cheongha.
We have to go overseas again
Where do you want to go?
I'm going to Italy Italy
Have you ever been outside when it thunders?
Yeah, yeah, it was scary
Have you ever been outside when lightning strikes?
That's not there yet
Have you ever been affected by heavy rain?
The center I used to go to had water in it, so it was hard to get it out.
Have you ever felt an earthquake?
No, not yet
What would it be like to feel an earthquake while abroad?
It would be scary if it was a foreign country
Do you like getting rained on?
Yeah, you just like what suits me?
Haha, my dear sister, you are as scary as a flood
Are you saying that because you were affected by a flood?
No, not even one?
What the hell are you talking about?
Have you seen that black box video coming up?
I see it sometimes, why?
Among the warm things that came out there, there is one that I remember
Is there anything warm there?
A woman who was almost at the traffic light turned around again to pick up an old man who couldn't get there. She was an angel...
Wow, you are a great person. No one could have done it easily.
That's amazing. What have you seen of Black Box?
I had an accident with a motorcycle and a car, and the motorcycle was swearing and breaking both side mirrors...
Oh, I tasted something spicy
I always see that...
There are a lot of secretly warm things!
I should read the articles more often too
Please pay attention to what's going on in the world.
It's been so long since I've watched the news
So you can see it today!
Yes! It's TV angle
Want to read some foreign articles?
I saw a foreign black box or CCTV.
Oh, I saw that. What's in it?
The car skidded onto the 8-lane road and there was a reversal.
Reversal? Wasn't it a big accident?
There was no accident. It's amazing that everything was avoided.
Wow, all 8 lanes?
Yeah I slid from left to right but didn't hit a single one.
Wow, I'm so glad that happened
If I had slipped, I would have been seriously injured.
I really used up all my luck
Accidents always require caution
That's right, even if you drive defensively, accidents don't happen just because you're good at it.
Right, safety is paramount worldwide
Anything else?
Sorry, I'll come back later
What perfume do you use?
I'm using the lipstick you bought me
Do you use body mist?
I love body mist
Where do you use hand wash?
I think it's L'Occitane
Then where is the hand cream from?
It's like living in L'Occitane
Have you tried Aesop hand cream?
Are you talking about something big?
Yeah, it's awesome, it's huge
I tried that in pink and I liked it
Aesop hand cream is the right choice
I love it because it smells good and isn't sticky.
I like it too because it's not sticky
I'll bring it to you later. I have several.
Sister, have you had a health checkup?
No, I haven't even once
It's crazy, we're getting old now
What, have you received it?
The companies I worked for were field positions, so it was mandatory to receive it once a year.
Then, if it's not a field job, I don't have to accept it?
No, office work is once every two years!
I guess it's because you have the 4 major insurances. What happens if you don't?
Company fines
Does that also screen for cervical cancer?
Yeah, once every two years, but it's so basic that you can add it
Did you try adding it?
I'm going to try adding it next year since next year is an even year for me.
Is there such a thing? Then when am I?
My sister is also an even number so next year is the next year
Then come with me
Sister, have you ever traded stocks?
I'm still doing it
Did you put in a lot of all the adults?
I just put a small amount aside instead of saving
It's amazing, he really looks like an adult
Don't you trade stocks?
I got it once because they said they would give it to me for free if I made an account at Toss...
Oh, where did you get it?
I got it from Interpark, but I didn't think I needed it, so I sold it for 5,000 won...
Why... maybe
I sold it and the next day it was 9000 won^^
Hey you, don't ever invest in stocks
Uh... I haven't even looked at you since then
It's really frustrating Kiki, even if you don't have money, you're not kidding
Wow I'm crying if I bought it for 10 weeks
Give me your phone and I'm banned from stocks
There's a drama I'm into these days
What is it this time?
A drama called Gaetmaeul Chachacha!
Who is that when you first hear that?
*** Actor and *** Actor!
Wow, the lineup is good
Both of you have really pretty dimples
So, do you two look good together?
It's totally awesome, so pretty and cool, and the content is also fun
Is it a gentle style?
Is it a style that just unfolds quickly?
Calm~ It's surprisingly calm but fun
You originally liked the ending
But the fishing village caught me
Where is that broadcast?
It's TVN. I love TVN.
You watch a lot of TV, Kiki
Sister, have you been to a comic book cafe?
I go often, ramen is delicious
No, you went to a snack shop. Don't you read Kiki's manga?
Well, I do see it, but my eyes spend more time on the ramen.
I was going to ask you to recommend a comic book, but you forgot?
So what do you want from me?
Do you read webtoons diligently?
Oh, I searched Naver and Daum
There is something I watch regularly
Heh, should I recommend it? Drew
No sorry I don't read webtoons
You don't even read the book
Yeah, I don't see it, actually
What are you trying to say?
I ask questions. You answer.
Am I by any chance your younger sibling?
Do you eat breakfast often?
No, it's better to sleep than to wake up!
Hey, you're the guy who gets scolded by your mom. Do you eat lunch at the company?
Yeah, I used to do it a lot, but these days it's annoying.
Do you have a restaurant you often go to?
I'm into kimbap these days!
Correct! Tuna kimbap! Is that right?
But that kimbap restaurant's Jinmichae kimbap is the real deal
What is the name of the kimbap restaurant?
Happy Kimbap? Just a neighborhood kimbap place Kiki
Kimbap and ramen are a perfect match, but why leave out the ramenㅜㅜ
They don't sell ramen there,
Wow, you only sell kimbap?
Yeah, so ramen is from the convenience store!
What kind of ramen do you like?
Guriguri raccoon! The soup is~ the best~!
What color did you use for the wallpaper?
Green! This is the best atmosphere ever.
Wasn't it hard to do it alone?
I thought I was going to die from the pain... You should never do this alone.
How long did it take?
Um... did it take about four hours then?
I can't do it alone! Maybe a friend will do it with me.
Do you know who that guy is?
Well, you don't really want to know?
Do you have a mirror at home?
No I just broke it with my fist
The person in the mirror is the one who will help me~
Aha, so you're saying there's no one?
How many mirrors do you have in your house?
I told you there aren't any? I just broke them all.
How many clocks do you have at home?
There are so many watches, maybe 4?
What car did you drive when you went to Jeju Island?
This time it's Tivoli!
But the child was a little sick
Is Tivoli an old car that was rented?
I guess so ㅠㅠ
I keep hearing strange noises
Did you choose the music well for the passenger seat?
Oh then then Kiki
There was a time when the situation and the song title fit so well that it was so funny
Wasn't there a traffic jam when you came from Dong Seoul Terminal to Incheon Terminal yesterday?
I didn't notice because I was sleeping, but I think we arrived around the expected time.
Wasn't there a traffic jam when you went from Incheon Terminal to Dong Seoul Terminal yesterday?
I didn't know very well because I was sleeping at that time.
Do you use the app to make reservations?
Yeah, the app is convenient! If you register your card
How long does it take to get from the terminal to your house by subway?
The bus from the terminal is more convenient!
How long does it take by bus?
About 20-30 minutes?
It won't take long!
Does your company have any weekend work hours these days?
Yeah, sometimes? When the client schedules a meeting on the weekend.
When do you want to change jobs?
Me in about 2 years?
If you change jobs, will you move house too?
I think I need to look at the company location
Far away places aren't that great, are they?
Well, that's because the location of my house is good right now!
What is the most important condition?
Money... and people you work with?
Is it okay if there are less than 5 people in the company?
Oh, I don't think that will work
There are so many restrictions, right?
Are you just going to make it in 3D and show it to us during the meeting?
Yeah, I do 3D and drawings too.
The broadcasting station's art team also makes designs like that, so aren't you interested?
Oh, that sounds fun too!
Army, do you know how old I am now?
Is there an age limit? How old are you?
We're 27 years old, so we don't have much time left.
Oh, you're going to the army?
Will you come visit me when I go to the military?
What do you see?
Will I be able to endure it if I go to the military?
Well, I think I can do well since I graduated from a physical education school.
I heard that a lot of people get hurt because their pride was damaged during military training, but will you comfort me when I go in and come out?
Just don't desert
Wouldn't it be nice to desert and meet your friends on TV?
I don't want to meet any DP people
I'm contacting you about Mr. Jeongmo's desertion. How about receiving a call like this?
I'm going to say I don't know that kind of person ㅠㅠ
Are you going to tell me that you don't know anything?
Are you going to contact me if you desert?
Do you want to learn English again?
I want to be good at conversation ㅠㅠ
When do you plan on starting to attend driving school?
Oh, but I'm busy in October so I guess I'll have to go starting in November
I heard there's an English class being taught over the phone these days. Have you seen that?
Oh I've done that
Oh my... If you ask in November, you might say December, right? ㅜㅜ
^^ You know me so well
Oh wow, how much is that?
I don't know the details because I took it as a package with TOEIC.
Do you do it once a week?
Yeah, yeah! But don't do it.
Is this a complete no-recommendation?
I wouldn't do it even if you asked me to do it with my own money.
Wow, does it really shine that much?
Yeah, those people's English pronunciation isn't that good either.
My mom and dad got their second dose yesterday!
Oh really? How are you feeling?
Dad is healthy, but Mom is so tired ㅜㅜ
Oh really ㅠㅠ? You should rest for a while.
You said you had a headache yesterday and took Tylenol three times.
Mom, Dad, did you get all the shots up to the second round?
Woohoo, my mom got the second dose recently.
Oh, Mom, are you okay?
Yeah, I just have muscle pain, but I'm fine.
Thank goodness you got Moderna?
Oh, I don't know about that! I think it was Pfizer.
Oh, my mom and dad got Pfizer too! Did your brother get it?
Yeah, I think you got all the way to the second round too, oppa?
Is there anyone around you who has been tested for coronavirus?
My mom did it recently ㅠㅠ Kiki
Oh ㅜㅜ Are you okay with your health?
A confirmed case occurred at the restaurant we went to for lunch, but luckily my mom tested negative!
When are you getting married?
Make a boyfriend first,
When are you getting a boyfriend?
Do you want to keep making me cry?
Is that a blur before your eyes? Are those tears?
Aren't there any good people around you?
I'm being bullied. Don't you have any good people around you?
We're both bullied
What if we both keep doing this and neither of us gets married?
It's not a shame to not be able to get married these days.
Dating is essential, marriage is optional~ There's even a song about it, haha
We can't even do the essentials?
There are exceptions in life... Are the things in front of my eyes tears?
I'll get a boyfriend someday, right?
Where were you born?
If you haven't been born yet, it's a crime for us
How old is your cat?
About 1.5 years old...? He's grown a lot
Wow, how old are you as a human?
Are you in the midst of your second year of middle school?
Wow do you have 2 cats
So that's why you keep asking questions these days
So you're tearing off the wallpaper?
Yeah, I'm seriously suffering from second-year middle school syndrome
Isn't that why you keep getting rejected?
No, I'm the one watching ^^
Are you eating well these days?
Oh right, I need to buy some feed.
Do you still like boxes?
Box love is still the same
Where do you buy your feed?
Just have it delivered online
Is there a sport you want to learn?
I want to learn paragliding
Do you want to watch the World Cup together next year?
Because neither of us got vaccinated ㅠ
If you're learning paragliding, do you want to become an instructor?
no
I just wanted to do it...
I want to try it
I know Danyang is famous for paragliding. Have you ever been there?
I think I went to Yeongwol next to it and did it!
Let's set a day aside and watch it together on World Cup TV.
If it's a Korea-Japan match, I definitely watch it even at dawn
Oh, I'll give you my annual leave, unconditionally
Do you know the rules of soccer?
I don't know much, but I know enough to know
Do you have a favorite soccer player?
I liked tea when I was young
Wow, you must have been very young
Kiki, yeah, really, baby
Let's play a round of Lumicube after a long time
Oh, it's been a while since I've done it
I think I'll go to a board cafe after a long time
Okay, okay! I found a really fun game.
Do you like Tekken games?
Isn't that just pressing it?
What game is it at the board cafe?
Yeah, it's called a penguin party. Let's go next time.
Tekken is actually a finger strength game.
Kiki, the one who just hits faster wins
Oh, is that something you do by placing penguins on ice?
Oh, that's not it! It's a card game Kiki
I heard there's a fun escape room in Hongdae. Have you tried it in Hongdae?
Yeah! Do you want to go escape the room?
There's an outdoor escape room. It starts in Hongdae and ends somewhere else. What do you think?
Outdoors? Wow, what is this? That's amazing.
Let's go on a trip to Hongdae
There are a lot of guesthouses in Hongdae
It's an hour and a half from my house, so that's about enough for a trip, right?
It's so far away ㅠㅠ
Aren't you trying too hard?
There were a lot of foreigners in the guesthouse.
Have you ever slept in a guesthouse?
Yeah, yeah! When I was in school
I heard there are gay parties too, have you ever been to one?
Oh, let's go to Jeju Island and have a Geha party.
Because of Corona, we're having a party for two people
It's so good, I failed to make connections while traveling
Even if just two people get together, it's a party, right?
If you want to do it with someone else, then
I won't miss it
I'm really looking forward to the night flight to Jeju Island.
I think they're both exhausted? Kiki
I really don't think it's worth the special price of 2,000 won.
So who found it really ㅠ
It was windy today. Did you go out?
Yeah, I went out for a bit earlier, but oh my
No but it feels a bit humidㅜㅜ
It's raining ㅠㅠ I did laundry today too
It really feels like the wind is blowing at the beach...
There has been no rain all week.
Tell me in advance when you do your laundry. It always rains then.
So to this extent, it is science
Tell me when you wash your shoes. It looks like a typhoon is coming.
Kiki, just avoid it when you travel and do laundry.
When I want to call a typhoon, I'll tell you. Please wash my shoes.
There is no need for a separate prayer service
I'm lucky with the weather so I'll go out there and try harder
Let's go to the weather fairy showdown
What's the weather like in Jeju Island?
That's why ㅠㅠ I think it should be good, but I'm worried
They say that starting next month, you can get the vaccine without a reservation.
Oh, then you're right?
I still think there's a lot of controversy about the vaccine pass.
Hey, what is it? Tell me!
Only vaccinated people can go to restaurants.
Wow, that's fatal... Isn't that too much pressure?
People who haven't been vaccinated can't enter without a negative test result from 24 to 72 hours ago.
No, then at least compensate for the side effects of the vaccine.
Have you seen the talk about a second vaccine?
Oh no! What is that?
There are more than 20,000 people who only take the first dose and give up on the second dose because the secondary side effects are too severe.
Wow, there was news like that?
Flu shots also have side effects, so it's strange that a shot like this that's being administered so quickly doesn't have any side effects...
But doesn't it have to be done twice to be effective?
That's right, even after getting the second dose, the military got infected this time.
There are also some who say that you have to get a booster shot or something like that ㅠ
There are some people who say that the president intentionally got the booster shot first in a foreign country. Is it really necessary to do that?
We also had a lot of controversy when our president didn't get vaccinated.
In Russia, there are currently 900 deaths per day.
Wow, people are dying because of corona?
The oil spill in California reminds me of Taean
Wow, that's right. I did a lot of volunteer work back then.
Have you been volunteering?
I couldn't go ㅠㅠ
I wish California would disappear like that soonㅜㅜ
A lot of my sea creatures are going to die ㅠㅠ
Russia is like that because of Corona...!
Oh my gosh, it's so scary ㅠㅠ Is everything ruined with Corona?
It's so heartbreaking that something like that happens in a vaccine development country.
Oh, they developed a vaccine in Russia?
Yeah, probably haha
Oh you are so smart
I use the Shrek pack, have you tried it?
Oh, that green one?
Yeah, have you tried that?
No, I'm not good at using packs ㅠㅠ
There are a lot of stick cosmetics coming out these days. Have you tried them?
Oh, with a stick? What do you have?
There used to be a stick perfume out there, have you tried it?
Oh, that doesn't smell that good
I heard that wrinkle-removing cosmetics come in a stick form.
Are we now at an age where we can manage?
I fell in love with him when I was 27~28 years old... Soon
It's really coming soon... Do you manage it separately too?
Me too... I'm at an age where I have to wear sunscreen now... Wear sunscreen?
No... I'm really going to go crazy soon
They say you should definitely apply sunscreen even in winter.
It's so annoying though ㅠㅠ
I'm at an age where I should be taking vitamins.
Are you taking your vitamins?
Nope! Are you going to get a health checkup this year?
Yeah, I promised my mom that I would get it by October.
You're a candidate for cervical cancer, so you get that too, right?
Am I the target? How do you know that?
In odd years, the target is people whose birthdays are in odd years, and in even years, the target is people whose birthdays are in even years~
Oh, just in the year you get your health checkup?
Yeah, yeah, there aren't many hospitals that do both comprehensive checkups and cervical cancer screenings. Look into it carefully. ㅜㅜ
Oh, thank you so much for the great information.
Aside from the basics, if you pay more, you can get a more detailed inspection.
Our company is completely basicㅠ
If you have an examination in October, does that mean you won't be drinking alcohol in October?
Oh, that's a bit difficult?
Let's recycle and throw away the health checkup results as soon as they come out.
Kiki, I'm just taking it to avoid paying the company a fine.
Is there a separate site to buy cat food?
Is there a pet-only shopping mall called Pet Friends?
Which site do you usually buy your shoes from?
I don't usually buy shoes online because I have to try them on before buying them.
Do they sell all the pet supplies there?
Yeah, everything is there except for the ones that aren't there.
Are you going to buy clothes before going to Jeju Island?
Oh, I want to buy it... Where was the site you sent me last time?
Are you talking about the Brandy Hoodie?
Ah, that seems right
But it seems like the weather is much hotter than I thought. Where can I see clothes?
I mainly go to a shopping mall called Yukyuk Girls
Is this a place that sells outerwear, pants, and tops?
Yeah, it even has accessories
It's cardigan weather these days, are you selling it at Yukyuk Girls?
Yeah, I guess so. I need to buy some clothes too.
Have you seen Yumi's cells?
I read the webtoon, but I didn't watch the drama.
I'm watching it right now and it's so cute but it's a real deal
But there was a lot of talk that Kim Go-eun and Yumi didn't get along.
But I think it's really cool that he put that controversy to rest with his acting skills...
That's a confession...
Are you doing that now?
Actor Ahn Bo-hyun also just shaved his beard in episode 3 and he looks so cool
Which broadcasting station does that?
I'm watching the rebroadcast on Tving right now
Ah, are there any Yumi cells in Tiving?
I think it's probably only Tvingaesa
Oh, I see...
Who else is the actor?
SHINee Minho come out!
Your face is like this
Oh, Minho is acting too? That's amazing...
Minho appears in the first scene of episode 1 and Kiki
Why does it feel like something is smoking
What movies have you seen recently?
I watched one on Netflix today!
What's the title? Was it fun?
A movie called Josee, the Tiger and the Fish
What genre is that movie?
The genre just says drama
Who is the actor appearing?
I don't know the name because he's a Japanese actor.
How many hours long is the movie?
I think it took about an hour and a half
Was the content worth watching?
I watched it because it was recommended to me, but I thought it was just okay
Are the fish actually coming out...
Oh, that's not it Kiki, it's just symbolic
I should watch it later too haha
But I think you'll be like that too
Did you eat breakfast this morning?
I ate at Yangpyeong house today
What did you eat at home this morning?
I ate soybean paste stew, scrambled eggs, and Korean food.
Home cooking is the best after all
What did you eat for lunch?
I ate cold noodles today
Wow I love naengmyeon
Did you make it?
Yeah, just tear the broth and put it in right away.
Are there any good restaurants around your house?
There's only one chicken place in my neighborhood.
It's close. Is it good there?
I went and tried it and it was good!
What's the name of the chicken place?
Korean Charcoal BBQ Kiki
Wow, buy me that too
How long ago was the main house built?
I think it's been about 5 years now
Which is more comfortable, a single-family home or an apartment?
I like apartments to live in Kiki
I don't go home often
Are single-family homes too hard to clean?
Since I have to clean up to the second floor, the whole day passes by.
I guess so
So how many bathrooms are there?
There is one on the first floor and one on the second floor.
So how many are there in the apartment?
My brother and I live in one apartment.
Okay, how many years have you been renting for?
I've been doing it for 2 years, and if nothing bad happens, I'll keep living.
Well, there aren't any leases these days.
They say moving is all about money ㅜㅜ
Moving costs are not cheap either
It's physically difficult too
right
So are you going to keep extending it?
Yeah, that's still my plan
Is public transportation good in Wonju?
No, the interval between trains is too long
Oh, I see. So you don't usually take the bus?
I don't take the bus often
I heard a train station was built. Do you take the train often?
I ride it often when I go to Gangneung
How about taking a taxi often?
When I don't have a car to commute to work, I ride it almost every day.
How much does it cost to ride one?
It costs about 5 thousand won
Oh, not quite close
It's just a moderate distance
I go to work to earn money, but I already spend money on my way to work.
Yeah, Kiki, it's the same when you get off work too
Have you ever taken a model taxi?
I rode it once in Seoul
Sister, if you do one part-time job, will it last long?
I also work part-time at a dormitory, and once I start, I stay for a long time.
How about a part-time job with a dorm?
I like it because the commute is super fast
Aren't you doing it for a long time too?
I also did Pava for a year
I've been a dodgeball instructor for a year!
What does a dodgeball instructor do?
I teach after school classes for elementary school students.
Are you going to school?
Yeah, I go every Saturday and exercise.
How many classes are there at a time?
I do this twice a day for 50 minutes and then 10 minutes, but the kids barely rest.
Are you teaching under a contract with the school?
no
Sign a contract with Incheon Sports Association and have them assign schools to you!
It's random. Is your school far from your house?
It takes about 15 minutes by taxi.
I guess you take a taxi every day since it's based on taxi standards Kiki
Have you seen Steel Troops?
I saw that you're doing a season 2, right?
Yeah, they're recruiting now. Do you want to apply?
Isn't this only possible for people who have served in the military?
Yes Kiki and only men Kiki
Should we hold hands and go to the military first?
I bet your grandmother would love it
He doesn't have any grandchildren, so he doesn't worry about military service, but he would be very happy if his two granddaughters went there holding hands.
Wouldn't you like it if there were two civil servants?
I'll try my best to support you
But, unnie, there's no age limit?
Oh right, I can't do it
Too bad~ What is the age limit?
Probably until I'm 27 years old
Are you okay?
Yes~ Sister~ My younger brother is 25 years old~ That's plenty~
Look at this, just like that
Sister, in what year of college did you join the company?
I started working in the job market in my third year.
Did you graduate and go?
Yeah, I graduated, went to an academy, and then got a job.
What academy did you go to?
Before I joined the company, I went to a computer and accounting school.
Accounting? What level did you study?
I learned level 1 and level 2, but I only have level 2 certification.
What did you learn about computers?
It was a beginner's course, so I learned a lot of different things.
Didn't you go to any other academies?
I learned video editing and computer skills last year.
Was it a non-face-to-face class last year?
Yeah, I learned computer skills remotely and went to an academy for video editing.
Was the non-face-to-face class okay?
I don't have anything to use for computers except Excel, so it's okay.
Thank goodness I learned a lot
Have you been in touch with your youngest aunt lately?
I haven't tried it, but what happened?
Oh, I got a call saying you got your second dose of the vaccine.
Thank goodness, did your youngest aunt's daughter get it too?
He was in his third year of high school, so he got it much earlier than us.
Are you preparing well for the entrance exam?
Since you said you go often, I think you've already submitted all the applications.
When will the announcement be made?
It will come out in November at the earliest, or mid-December at the latest.
There's not much time left, I'm nervous
Your aunt must be nervous too, right?
Even if you don't say it, you're probably the most worried...
My aunt is the type to suffer alone, so she must be suffering alone.
Did your aunt and uncle get the second dose too?
Yeah, yeah, my mom got hit twice and she's so weak ㅜㅜ
You should get better soon ㅜㅜ
Sister, do you fight often when you're dating?
Then then just breathe and fight
Akiki, if you keep fighting you'll get tired ㅜㅜ
yes
So you're tired...? You?
I'm a bit different depending on the person.
Are there times when you don't fight to the point where it gets frustrating?
yes...
It's so hard to fight
That's why I'm a pacifist
Do you celebrate anniversaries often?
Yeah, yeah, and there's a day that I think is the most important
Oh, seriously? When?
We think of each other's birthdays as the most important haha
You're smart. Do you often give anniversary gifts?
I often give gifts even if it is not a special day.
Well, it's better to give a gift if you want to give one, even if it's not a special day.
Yeah right, that's why I do it often!
Please give me one too~ ^^
Which is the prettiest among spring, summer, fall, and winter?
Gaeul is the most cute
Do you eat the same snacks in spring, summer, fall, and winter?
We all eat the same snacks
Then there are four toys?
Yeah yeah if you don't then fight Kiki
I have to make them all pretty one by one
You shouldn't discriminate against children like that.
Yeah, that's right
Kiki, isn't it hard to wash yourself?
Yeah, so mom and dad take care of Kiki
Oh, you're being honest, Kiki.
It must be hard
Yeah, it was hard to manage
So how do you manage the kids' tents?
That too from mom and dad~ ^^
What is your sister's role?
I'm going to play with all my might Kiki
Sister, do you know all the soccer rules?
no
I don't really watch soccer. What about you?
I wake up at dawn and watch the World Cup
Hey, is there any exercise you want to learn these days?
I'm looking at each one because I want to learn Jiu-Jitsu
Do you want to do the Dobok workout again?
Yeah, I want to do a dobok workout, but I don't want to do taekwondo again.
Is it because Taekwondo is too intense?
Oh, I'm bored
I don't want to see you anymore
That could be it Kiki
How long have you been doing taekwondo?
I did Taekwondo from the age of 7 until I majored in it in college.
Man, this is so boring
Is Jiu-Jitsu fun?
If you look at the reviews, it seems really fun
Try it and let me know what you think
Let me give it a try!
Yeah, keep going and you'll do well
Sister, have you ever played Tales Runner?
I tried it, it really took a long time
It's so much fun
Are you good at that?
I jumped over the hurdles pretty well, didn't you?
I liked that super jump thing
That's hard to get the timing right, Kiki
Yeah, so I missed out a few times at first, Kiki too
Speaking of missing things, I also think of carts.
The cart doesn't fall off easily either
It's a national rule to get out of a curve.
that's right
Kiki Drift is great if you're good at it, but if you get tired of it, it's goodbye
Do you like kart speed racing?
I like item wars better
When you do a speed battle, you have to be completely focused, right?
If you do that, you'll get overtaken right away.
That's right, I want to do it because you mentioned Kiki
Have you ever been to Tongyeong?
No, why? What's there?
I want to go to a place with a luge like Kart Rider
Let's go together
Is the traffic okay there?
Oh traffic is shit
It's definitely just a train
Oh, so there's no bus?
There are some at Incheon Terminal, but there are only 3 per day ㅜㅜ
Ah, transportation is also important when traveling ㅜㅜ
So that's the biggest problem and I still haven't been able to go.
I see ㅜㅜ Is there no other place to go?
Yes, I've been to Ganghwa Island several times already.
Oh, how about there?
It's so much fun
Do you want to go with me?
Okay, let's go play in Ganghwado.
Ganghwado Pension is also great!
Let's rent a pension and have fun
Do you like hot weather?
I don't feel the heat very well so I'm fine
Are you coping well with this cold weather?
Instead, I can handle the cold well
Oh, do you wear long padding in winter?
I wear both shorts and longs
So does that mean it's definitely a padding fine?
It's padding, no matter what
Are you a coat?
I don't catch cold easily, so I don't wear padding.
Wow, you're not cold? Even without padding?
Yeah, it's so uncomfortable to wear padding
Don't you even make scarves and things like that?
Scarf Now I wear it occasionally
Aren't you wearing gloves?
Yeah, I never wear gloves
Wow you are young
Have you seen the squid game number leak incident?
Squid game? What is that?
There's a squid game on Netflix, and there's a number on the business card.
Number? Cell phone number?
Yeah, but that number was a regular number.
Oh, did you get permission from that person?
No, that's not it
So it was chaos
But does anyone call that number?
I got 4000 calls
My daily life is not going well
Wow, there are people calling?
Yeah, I sent a text message too
I'm seriously calling you
Shouldn't you compensate me?
Yeah, at first I said I would give 1 million won in compensation.
You're going to handle it for just 1 million won?
I heard they raised it to 500 because of the chaos
It doesn't seem like an amount that can be discussed in a company that took away 100 or 500 degrees of daily life.
Squid game is super famous all over the world
The actors who appear there will become famous for their images from the squid game.
That's why actor Lee Jung-jae is remembered overseas as an actor who wears tracksuits.
Where do you usually get foreign news?
I usually click on the world section on Naver News to see it.
Should I click on the article directly and look at it carefully?
Haha no actually just look at the title
Do you read other articles often?
Yeah, all the articles are just titles. Kiki
I heard that these days you have to get a booster shot. What do you think about that?
Hmm I don't trust the vaccine itself
I'm also wondering if it's right for me to get vaccinated
When did you get the first one?
I got it last week
Then will the second one be right too?
I was really worried about that
What color do you want for your nail art?
I'm into pumpkin nails these days
I have it in my hand right now haha
How much did you pay for it?
Did you do it at the shop?
I did it at a 60,000 won shop
Aren't you doing it all by yourself these days?
I was going to do it myself, but since it was the day my exams were over, I did it at the shop ㅜㅜ
What color will you make yourself?
Should I do white this time, sis?
I'm drawn to coffee color these days
I have that at home. I'll go get it.
From Wonju to Incheon to get a manicure...?
If you come, you know what? I'll do it for you.
There are a lot of nail shops in Wonju too...
It's a pity
I'll do it for you next time you come to Incheon
I'll think about that color
Are you taking your vitamins well?
I'm taking that yellow multivitamin you bought me.
What did I buy you?
What Yoo Jae-seok is advertising is Kiki
What else do you eat?
I'm eating pomegranate too
They say it's good for women. Is that okay?
I eat pomegranate powder and it seems okay
Oh, do you have powder too? Other than drinks?
Yeah, powder is better than drink
Have you ever tried all collagen?
Take that in pill form
I also take a lot of medicine
But is it hard for you to eat it consistently?
That's why I didn't even start Kiki
I'll buy it for you too
Have you ever seen anything in Balan?
Yeah, there's a lot to see, but I can't buy anything.
Fact, have you seen Trenby?
That's the same Kiki
It's not mine
Which one is better?
I use Trenby for finding things
Oh, how about Balan?
Balan often holds events
This is great information
By the way, where do you buy Kiki's shoes?
I ordered from that brand's site
Where can I compare prices?
I don't use Enuri.com
Are you okay being there?
Yeah, it's perfect because it organizes the site in one go.
I should try it too
Wow, have you seen The Great Escape 4?
Haven't seen it yet. Was it fun?
Yeah yeah I saw the last episode of Director's Cut on Sunday Kiki
Oing, what's the director's cut?
Ah, as a special, let's recap the episodes we've done so far and talk about them!
Oh, that would be more fun
I like NG scenes like this more
Would you like to watch a making-of video?
So I watch all the makings of my favorite dramas
So what are you watching these days?
Let's look at the seaside village
Is that fun?
I see a lot of people
It's so much fun
You really have to see it
Are there any dramas that you don't find funny?
Aigoo Ram, if it's not fun, stop at episode 1
Ah, you're the type who doesn't waste time, Kiki.
Do you often watch movies at home?
Yeah, I like watching it at home better
Oh, that's amazing
Did you set up the speakers at home well?
I like movies so I installed speakers
Do you watch horror movies at home too?
I can't watch horror movies. You?
I can't see it at home...
Why can't I see it?
Are you not able to see it well?
I'm so focused...
Keep doing something else
Kiki, your concentration is waning
Are you concentrating well, Unnie?
When a movie starts, I just watch the movie
This concentration is amazing
Do you like foreign movies?
I like foreign movies
Oh wow that's great
I can't do it
See you later
What did you have for lunch today?
I ate pasta today
Have you been to all the good restaurants?
Have you tried rolling pasta?
Oh, is that Chef Baek Jong-won’s?
Yeah, right. Have you been there?
I've been there once
What did you eat?
I ate aglio olio
I had a rose something and the price was okay.
The price is really reasonable
The pickles there are delicious
Kiki: So is this a good place for pickles?
That's right. It's delicious.
What are you going to have for dinner?
I have class so I'm a little late, so chicken breast...?
you?
I leave home cooking to my mom's choice.
Home cooking is still the best
Sister, how did you choose the interior?
I didn't know how to look at it, so I asked a friend who works in construction and chose it.
Oh, did you decide all these colors?
Yeah, I asked if I could change what I already had.
Shouldn't the whole world be restored to its original state before leaving?
Yeah, but the painting was a mess, so I told him I was going to do it myself and he was happy about it.
Thank goodness you chose a color that you like, so it's awesome
If it's not a new building or a monthly rental, you should actually do it alone.
Did you even fix the bathroom you said you didn't like?
No, I can't use the bathroom by myself Kiki
Is the toilet and sink in one unit?
Yeah, if they're separate, you can buy them separately and do them ㅜㅜ
Oh, that's a bit disappointing
But luckily the water pressure is fine
Wow water pressure is not important
My apartment's water pressure was weak, so I had to change the shower and other things, and it cost a lot of money.
So I'm satisfied with that alone
Is there a bus stop in front of your house?
It's right in front of you
How many buses come to this place?
Type... There are two, almost none
you?
I'm at a bus stop everywhere...
Is there a bus that I can ride frequently?
I don't really remember taking a bus in Incheon...
You're taking the subway
How far is the subway station from home?
Exit 3 is the name of our apartment. It's so cool.
Somehow I don't remember walking much when I went to your house.
If I pick you up at Incheon Terminal and take the train together, it will take 5 minutes from the terminal to the station and 5 minutes from our station to the house.
Is that why it's called a station area?
More than just having a lot of bus stops, having a subway station really helps...
The metropolitan area is connected by subway, so it will be even more so.
So I don't know geography very well, but if you tell me the subway station, I'll know the distance.
Oh, I guess you really did ride that many
How is your work life?
What about fresh graduates... If you want to be rude, you have to be rude
If I keep doing this, I'll be a freshman my whole life.
I thought it was a bad thing to be picky, but it wasn't.
Actually, it's also saying, do as you're told and do as much as you're told...haha
Yes, thinking like that is good for your mental health.
When will I get my paycheck?
I'm coming out on the 10th
you?
30 days haha
It was a while ago
But I think you'll need to get your paycheck soon, right?
That's such a cute balance
There's a big difference in salary compared to my previous company.
How was it before?
Even if you get paid a lot of money, you won't have any anyway
Is it not there whether you earn it or not?
Uh... but it's better now than then...
It's okay now just save up money
Sister, are there a lot of professional soldiers around you?
Just a little bit
You're here too, right?
Come to think of it, there really are a lot
If I remember correctly, your ex-boyfriend was also a career soldier, right?
Why is that memory only good in times like this?
I'm confident about this
Where were you
I went to the special forces
It's still there now
You went on a business trip last time, right?
I guess so
I just know that he's a special agent
Wasn't the guy I met last time a career soldier? He said he was in Gangwon-do.
Ah, the army in Hongcheon
Is that guy on vacation these days?
I came out once in April and we drank together and it was chaos Kiki
Why? What happened?
We were all in a car accident while taking a taxi to their house, Kiki.
Oh, is that guy that guy?
Shouldn't you guys be together? Kiki
Sister, is there any certification you want to get these days?
I want to go back to college
The whole scale is different
What major?
I transferred to the dental school to go back to the dental school.
That's great
But my senior from school is going to the dental clinic again and he said there are a lot of people who came back like him.
The path is clear and you won't starve to death
Okay, I guess so
When I was working out, my teacher also came out with water. It's amazing.
What certification do you want to get?
First of all, you get fooled, and that's a lifelong homework.
Anything else? Do you want to follow?
I only have a level 2 computer skills certificate, so I want to get a level 1 certificate.
Is there a big difference between 1st and 2nd grade?
There is one practical subject that is different, but it is very big and difficult...
I can do it
When did you get your level 2 license?
I got my 2nd grade early this year Kiki
Let's aim for early next year
Sister, did you get your vaccine?
Ah, I'm not feeling well so I'm not going to do it
Are you okay these days?
I am taking insulin and controlling my diet regularly.
Maybe the whole family needs to help ㅜㅜ
The taste you know is scarier ㅜㅜ
So, my sister and I weren't born that way, so we already knew the taste...
I had a hard time with that
It must have been hard for families who had to control their food too.
Mom and Dad had a hard time at first
My aunt studies hard and checks everything to see if I can eat anything. She's really amazing...
Yeah, I still don't know even though I'm watching from the side
Wow, that's amazing...
Are all the aftereffects of car accidents gone now?
My parents are still a little uncomfortable
The aftereffects are really dangerous ㅜㅜ
So, be careful of traffic accidents.
Sister, what is your ideal type?
I like people who are good at communicating.
Oh, how much of an age difference is okay?
Well, age doesn't really matter
Who would you like to sing the wedding song?
Do you want to call?
You call me
Do you trust me?
Can I choose the song?
You...choose...?
I didn't think of that
Then I'll give you a look
Pick from Zia's songs
Aren't all of Zia's songs break-up songs...?
Got caught
If you and your husband live long distance, where do you want to have your wedding?
I think it would be better to talk it out and have one of you do it in your hometown.
I think it would be better for one side to be considerate rather than both sides moving.
That's okay too
Instead, if you choose your hometown, you have to pay for the other party's bus rental fee.
wow difficult wedding
So I met a local guy and Kiki
Have you ever raised a rabbit?
I've only seen rabbits at the zoo.
If I were to raise a rabbit, would I raise it in the yard?
Where are rabbits supposed to be raised in the first place...?
That's right... If you raise a rabbit in the yard, will it say goodbye?
Then I guess I won't go see my mom
Have you ever raised fish?
I was there for a while when I was young
I heard that maintaining a fish tank is no joke. What do you think?
Yeah, so not now ^^
It's so hard
I have to change that water too, so it'll take a lot of work.
I don't remember well because I was young, but I remember my parents being very concerned.
Do you know that they sell fish at E-Mart?
I didn't know because there's no E-Mart around my house.
Sold them all?
If you go to a large E-Mart, there's a fish corner!
It's amazing. Let's go together next time we go to Incheon.
Did you play screen golf well yesterday?
It's my first time playing golf and it's fun.
Have you ever played golf?
I had a golf class at university.
So there's a screen golf course at the school?
No, the only advantage our school had was the outdoor golf course.
Oh, how about some golf credits?
Oh, that's what the professor made a bet on during the exam period. Kiki
Is this something like &quot;Beat the professor&quot;?
Yeah, but I'm the first student in the school to beat a professor.
Then I guess my grades will be high
So A Plus haha
It feels so good
Have you been to a golf course since then?
What is golf? Adonno
Kiki's magical ability to forget everything after graduation
Of course, I have no idea how to hold a golf club.
Now you will learn from me
Sister, are there any pro-gamers around you?
I don't have it, but you do?
? What are you talking about when there isn't one?
Oh, my ex-boyfriend was a pro-gamer
Where do I list my past boyfriends?
I'm scared
It's all in my head, right?
It was the 2nd army
I didn't debut
Is my memory not wrong?
Yes, yes, you did a great job. I highly recommend it.
Do you still do sudden these days?
No I'm going to die from sudden fire in the hole
Isn't that what the game was originally designed for?
That's true
That's the funniest thing
Are you good at sniping?
No, guns are not important to me.
You'll die that quickly
Do you have any travel tips for when you're packing your own luggage?
I put them in organized pouches
Oh, then it will be easy to find.
Do you take your shoes with you too?
Take your shoes with the soles wrapped in that hair cap.
Oh honey, I'm going to Jeju Island soon, I'll keep that in mind
Have you finished planning the route?
My friend and I decided to stay one night each and enjoy each other's tours.
That's an idea too, there's nothing to fight about
I saw a tip on Instagram about not fighting while traveling
What is it, what is it?
If you get angry and say you're going to buy me food, just say &quot;Smile, smile&quot; if your expression is a little weird. If you don't want to buy me food, just say &quot;Smile&quot; Kiki
Ah, I'll smile even if it's forced
That's good too
But I've never fought with my friends when I go out to play.
Fortunately, if something goes wrong, you can go with your friends and take separate flights.
Have you ever traveled abroad with friends?
Jeju Island is not over yet
Are you lucky with the weather?
I went to Jeju Island, but I couldn't come back because of the typhoon.
Wow, did you say goodbye to the typhoon?
As I was leaving, a typhoon followed me.
Maybe Typhoon planned it first, but my sister followed him
That's right, Typhoon and I are kind of close.
When and what season did you go?
I went there for my birthday so it was around this time
Have you ever said hello to Hongsu?
Fortunately, not yet
It's okay, I still have a lot of time left to live, so there are plenty of opportunities to say goodbye.
Hello, are you okay...?
Why do you look so excited?
Haha, did you get caught?
Sister, doesn't it rain every time you do laundry?
So, I did the laundry yesterday
Wow, tell me when you do the laundry, I'll bring an umbrella
Uh... Just take care of it this week.
Have you seen the controversy over soccer players' private lives?
What is that?
What controversy?
My girlfriend exposed it and said that I cheated on her.
You had an affair with a certain person?
You said there were 10 people
Wow, 10 people? That's awesome.
The neutral gear is still required, but the soccer player is not even receiving calls from the club.
Wow, if you contact them, the club will resolve the issue and issue an apology, but you must be flustered.
Right... I heard you closed SNS too
Oh my, what could it be...
So ㅜㅜ I can't contact you
Are you a famous soccer player?
I don't know because the soccer players in my head stop at *** player *** player Kiki
If you don't know, then of course I don't know.
This is a different story, but I heard that sports players also have a hard time with malicious comments.
I wish sports articles would also close comments
Have you seen the Russian news?
No, I don't see it well
What do you have?
We're making a movie that's shot in space.
Wow, space? The universe I'm thinking of?
Wow, that's amazing. It's the first in the world.
Wow, so you're finishing filming the movie?
Ah, I think the filming during the movie was about 30 to 40 minutes long.
It's so detailed
How many hours after launch did we arrive at the space station?
How long does it take to get there?
It took 3 hours and 20 minutes!
So how long are you there?
It's expected to last about 12 days
What's the story that takes you all the way to the space station...?
This is the story of a female doctor who was sent to the space station to save an astronaut.
Oh it's already fun
Sister, how do you take care of your skin?
I pack often
If you take one pack a day, you will see real changes.
Wow, I can't do that because it's annoying
What kind of makeup does Kiki use?
Apply sunscreen and foundation
Do you use waterproof sunscreen?
So that it doesn't get erased anywhere
When you were dieting to take a profile picture, what did you want to eat the most?
Pizza Tteokbokki
First of all, it's all about gaining weight
This is really amazing...
Did you exercise alone?
The center teachers also helped me and made it almost like an individual exercise.
Great... I can't do this even if I die
Never do that. The side effects are severe.
What are the side effects?
Overeating becomes a habit and is bad for your health.
Profile pictures are the number one thing that makes you unhealthy
Yeah that's the best shortcut
Sister, how many insurances do you have?
I also got dental insurance this time, so I think I'll have 5
What's so much...?
You have to be prepared because you never know when something will happen.
I'm going to tear my shins paying the insurance premiums.
How much insurance do you have?
I have 3, and that's just 3 including light driver's insurance.
Have you ever eaten up insurance premiums?
Yeah, it was so sweet. It was so sweet when I was a victim of a recent traffic accident.
Is it honey?
How much did you get paid?
I pay about ten thousand won a month, and it's only been two years since I signed the contract.
You heard me very wisely.
How much did you get paid?
I received less than 300,000 won for hospitalization fees.
I paid the insurance premium
You were almost a savings account Kiki
Sister, when you shop online, do you put a lot of items on your wish list?
It's full even if you don't buy it
It's a national rule
So how often do you buy them?
I put it on my wish list and buy 50% of it on payday.
Wow, almost done Kiki
Which shopping mall do you use?
I am a VVIP at Gmarket
Really? Let me use yours.
Please use my coupons a lot and increase my transaction volume.
I got a zigzag birthday coupon. Do you want to use it?
Okay, but you know the coupon, you have to be careful of the small print
It says &quot;3,000 won discount&quot; in big letters, but when you purchase over 30,000 won, this is written in small letters?
If you pretend, it's pretend
That's right
You have to take a good look at that
I'll look at the zigzag too
Sorry, please tell me again
Oh, I'll check and tell you, Kiki
See Yumi's cells?
I heard that's fun these days. Where can I find it?
It's only on Tving, it's really fun ㅜㅜ
I think that's what Mr. *** said he was doing
You took on the role of a voice actor for the cell
Even that is so attractive ㅜㅜ
Did you end up watching Penthouse?
I watched it until the last episode out of loyalty
Have you watched all of Hospital Playlist?
I still haven't seen the last broadcast
It seems like these days, more and more shows are being broadcast only on Netflix and Tving.
So it's amazing, how could I have known it would turn out like this?
Yes, it would cost a lot of money to maintain a broadcasting station.
But they say the pay is higher for cable than terrestrial broadcasting
Oh really? Oh that's amazing
So, the person who used to be a staff member at KBS 1 Night 2 Days is now a high-ranking person at TVING.
PD Na also left KBS, wow
What movie genre do you like?
I'm definitely a romantic
you?
I'm all about action haha
Are the actions in foreign films bigger in scale than in our country's films?
I guess so
There's a saying people have
What is it?
Are you saying that foreign films won?
Korean movies still lack action because they can't blow up foreign cars.
I guess he's saying it to make people laugh
Oh, that's right. It's always the domestic cars that break, explode, and fall off.
But I find the fighting and action scenes in our country's movies fun and thrilling.
When you look at it, there are times when you are amazed and say, “Wow, how can someone attack like that when they do something like that?”
That's right, that's amazing.
Is there someone who teaches all that stuff?
I know there is a separate action director
Then the actors who learn all that are also great
Of course, there are stuntmen, but we have to capture the scene as best as possible.
The stuntmen were also incredibly cool.
Did you have dinner at work?
I had a quick bite of bread today on my way back from the hospital.
Have you had anything to drink today?
Abara for lunch and dessert today!
What is Abara? What is Abara?
Iced Vanilla Latte~
Is there a good restaurant in Abara?
I saw on the internet that Coffee Bean was delicious
What did you have for lunch?
I ate kimbap and tteokguk for lunch!
What are you going to have for lunch tomorrow?
I want to eat something healthy tomorrow ㅠㅠ
Are there a lot of restaurants around the company?
It's not that much ㅠㅠ
Is there a Korean buffet around the company?
Yeah, there is, but I've never been there!
When choosing a house, what was the most important thing you considered?
First of all, the sink is clogged!
What do you mean blocked?
Not just the legs under the sink, but the sink is completely blocked!
Is there something under the sink that just has legs?
That's amazing...
Yeah, that's what the old house was like ㅠㅠ
I'm scared because I think something is going to pass by below.
Wasn't it hard to find a place to live?
ㅠㅠ It was hard to find something in the price range I wanted
Are you paying the mortgage interest yourself?
Yeah, I'm paying for that!
How much per month
Um, 58?
I borrowed 80 million won, so I pay about 80,000 won a month!
How much is the management fee?
The management fee is 50,000 won per month!
Oh, you're saying that you pay 130,000 won a month for a rental house?
Oh, is that so?!
It's totally cheap!
What is the closest subway station to my house?
Achasan Station! Have you been to Achasan Station?
I've been there about 3 times
How many minutes does it take to walk?
It takes about 7 minutes on foot
Is the road uphill?
No, rather it's going downhill lol
If it's Achasan, is it a real mountain?
Yeah, it's a real mountain!
There are a lot of hikers on weekends.
It'll be noisy in the morning
Right ㅠㅠ Which station is your house close to?
I am Shin Yeon-su Station's Lee Ji-rong!
Was that Incheon Line 1?
Sky blue line?
Incheon Line 1 is in blue!
Are you purple?
Yeah, purple line 5!
Isn't it too far to change to Line 5 at Singil?
Oh right ㅠㅠ I really have to walk a long way...
How many minutes does it take to get your paycheck back?
Me? It was a 10 minute cut...?
It really just passed by
What is your main job?
I design architecture!
Do you have meetings often?
Meetings once a week or so?
Do you guys have a meeting too?
We never
What do you guys talk about when you meet?
Just a weekly to-do briefing
Who's having a meeting like crazy?
Kiki, on the third floor, the boss! My shooter
What time does the meeting start?
9 o'clock in the morning!
Do you have a shooter in charge too?
I have someone in charge!
How long is the meeting?
It's different every week, but it's usually about 40 minutes.
Do you get a lot of opinions when you do that?
I'm just talking about what I have to do, so I won't be giving my opinion!
What suits me: Army, Air Force, Special Forces, Navy?
You are a special agent!
It's so hard!
You just don't want to see me?
No, it's cool!
If you go to the special forces, you should brag about it.
My friend~ It's a special offer~ I can't come out~ I can't see~ Is this right?
Oh no~ How many years do special forces soldiers serve?
Isn't being a career soldier a job for life...?
Haha, without knowing it, you look good in the air force
Me? Why doesn't the Air Force suit me?
How cool would it be to fly away like that
Are you trying to blow me away? ㅠㅠ
I can never be discharged
You said you wanted to go paragliding
If you go there, it's free for me
Kiki Ah, my junior will be discharged soon. What would be a good gift?
Isn't alcohol the best when you're on vacation?
So what is popular as an enlistment gift?
I feel like sunscreen or a watch would be the best~
Thanks for the recommendation!
I have to go check out the alcohol.
Have you ever been to a study cafe?
Oh no, I've never been there
you?
I have nothing to do either haha
Have you ever studied at a cafe?
Yeah! I heard that these days, tutoring is also done in cafes.
Are you always nervous before a school exam?
Well, not really, except for the singing test?
I think it is advantageous to do tutoring at a cafe because the cafe charges a drink order instead of an entrance fee.
But I don't know if the student will be able to concentrate well.
What song did you sing when you took the singing test?
I sing 10cm!
you?
I remember waiting for Yoon Ha and calling her!
We played karaoke as a punishment during music class. Have you ever done something like that?
Oh no, there was no such thing.
Is this your idea, teacher...?
Yeah, you played the song yourself, Kiki
I remember singing K.Will's song as a punishment back then
Have you ever studied the rest?
No one did it even though we asked them to...
Have you been there?
I couldn't memorize the multiplication table when I was young.
When are you going to the housewarming party, honey?
I think I'll go on Sunday the 24th
Were you the only one invited that day?
No, my whole family!
Wow, so your brother prepares the food?
My brother isn't good at cooking.
For housewarming, the best thing to do is to package the delivery food nicely.
Didn't you say you were going to your cousin's housewarming party?
I'm on Saturday the 23rd
What's on in October?
Does your cousin live alone?
I live with my cousin!
Does your brother live with his wife?
Yeah, right! Thanks to you, my family has grown.
Oh, it's great that you think that way, your family has grown.
It's still awkward to call me new sister ㅠ
But why does that title seem so distant...?
Right... I just want to call you by your name
Do you celebrate your anniversaries often when you're dating?
depending on?
But as time goes by, I only take care of the big ones.
If you get a boyfriend, will you call him by a nickname?
No, I'm not good at staring ㅠ
you?
I call your name! You say mister or Kiki
What do you like when your boyfriend calls you?
I also like it when people just call me by my name
Have you ever met your boyfriend's family?
Yeah, I've met Kiki before.
Have you ever been to your boyfriend's house?
I don't think I've ever been to my parents' house
What is your ideal type?
I am someone I can rely on!
How much of an age difference is okay?
Plus or minus 5 or something?
you?
Um, me too, to that extent?
I've never met a minus before, so I don't really know.
Yeah, actually I don't like minuses either
Don't I look like an iguana?
Have you ever actually seen an iguana?
Actually no haha
You look like a fish
What kind of fish...?
I'm scared
Um, there's that one~
Don't tell me in advance, I'll get hurt~
How much does my cat weigh?
About 8 kilos?
Oh my god, you look so fat...?
Huh...? Oh, I don't know the weight standard...
How many people?
No, I eat diet food... ㅠㅠ
Then 3 kilos...?
What is the weight standard for babies?
Actually, I don't know because I haven't watched it recently.
I think it'll be about 6 kilos
It's right in the middle
But how much do babies weigh?
Not moving?
Oh my gosh, I have to put it on a huge scale and measure it.
Wow, it even calculates movement
Or you can also measure it with a human baby scale.
I'm going camping glamping next month
Oh really
Where are you going?
I was going to Ganghwado, but it was really hard to get a reservation because it was full.
Have you been there?
I've only been glamping
How was your day?
Was it okay?
Yeah but it would be more convenient if I had a car ㅠㅠ
Have you ever played volleyball?
no!
Have you tried it?
I was in the volleyball club when I was in elementary school.
It's amazing
Oh, I had no idea.
What did you do again?
I still remember the hand movements
I guess the body doesn't forget
Yeah, I also used nunchaku in taekwondo.
If you use nunchaku, won't you get bruises on your body?
You have to have bruises to show that you've been working out
Actually, those aluminum nunchucks really hurt
Then should I make you a fool?
Wouldn't that be easy for me?
Let me show off my workout too
It's been a while since we played Opchi?
Our computer is old so it won't work
Diva, can you carry some junklets?
A level is way above you
Levels are given only over time...
How many hours did you do it in a day?
When I was at my peak, I would go to a spa and spend three hours there.
Wow, if I do that, won't I get motion sickness?
I just need you to move with me
Be in pain with me
That's a little embarrassing
It's embarrassing, but you can do it for a moment. Do you want to follow along?
There are some kids who move their bodies while going kart. Is that you?
I'm almost 4D
I went to the arcade today!
What game did you play!
What kind of ball throwing game is that?
When you go on a trip, do you tend to take your time and make plans?
Yeah, so if the plan goes wrong, you can change it.
Is the schedule like a round vacation schedule? Or is it organized in Excel?
Isn't it neater to do it in Excel?!
I like organizing things like that too, I love it
You're a planner too
In fact, you're the type of person who plans everything, not just when you're traveling, but also in your daily life, right?
I like making plans, but I'm not good at executing them.
What's the first thing you think about when choosing a travel destination?
What is there to eat!
When you go out to play, do you usually try all the famous local foods?
Yeah, I have to try it!
Do you like exploring restaurants too?
Yeah, yeah, but it's hard to stand in line ㅜㅜ
you?
I can endure it for about 30 minutes, but more than that is a bit much ㅠㅠ
If I wait and eat, won't my food actually taste bad...?
Do you also have a taste for good food?
It was cold on my way home today, but it got hot on the train.
you?
Yeah, the outside air is cool, but somehow... it's hot.
Don't you want to get struck by lightning?
Is it possible to live with that?
Do you want to have a snowball fight with me when it snows?
I absolutely love snowball fights.
Can I use a weapon?
Isn't that just a fight?
Do you like snowball fights?
Do you like making snowmen?
I don't really care about snow.
Do you hate snowy days?
Muddy, mushy, icy road, ugh
It doesn't suit me ㅠㅠ I really like snowy days
I'd rather have rain ㅜㅜ
You don't like rain?
Ah, I'd rather have snow than rain...
Do you wear gloves when it snows?
No, you have to touch it with your bare hands to enjoy it
Have you seen the announcement that universities are short on students these days?
Wow, really? So if I apply, I'll get accepted?
Yes, last year, local medical schools fell short...
Wow, things really change a lot in just a few years.
So Kiki said that from 93 to 97, school was the hardest for us.
There were the most repeat and third-time repeaters at this time.
I guess we've really become the latte generation
I mean, I took the practical exam in several groups.
Is this what a latte is now?
Right, Kiki, we gathered in the auditorium and looked at the essays and stuffㅠ
And if you have a third child, the third child will receive a full college tuition scholarship.
It's amazing
But I don't have enough money to send them to college...
Yeah... The first and second ones have to go too...
Wow, did you see the inflation rate this time?
Why haven't I seen it?
Prices keep rising, but why don't our salaries increase?
Our salary is cute and small
I want to get a big and scary salary too
Have you seen any oil shortages abroad right now?
Oh my, why is there a shortage of oil?
I don't know! The car can't run because it has no gas.
Do you know what movie is really popular overseas these days?
No, I don't know. What is there?
What is it?
Squid games are so popular these days
Oh my goodness, those foreigners only know the *** actor Kiki
So, I heard that making dalgona is a trend all over the world.
Oh wow, are you good at that?
I've never done it before ㅠㅠ
These days, Korean culture is a huge topic of conversation all over the world.
When Netflix produces, if it goes well, it's thanks to the producer, but if it doesn't, it's thanks to the publisher, so it all seems different!
This time, ** also released a song with *****...
Wow, he is a truly respectable Korean singer.
I think you also performed at the UN
Oh my gosh, this is really cool...
There's no way I can become more famous now
How do you take care of your skin?
You don't wear much makeup!
Oh, you're not doing that because you find it annoying?
I guess so too...
Are you in charge?
I pack when I have time
Do you have any pack recommendations?
They say it's good to take one pack a day
I recommend this mask pack
Which brand of mask pack do you buy?
My uncle brought it to me! Haha
Have you ever tried making your own pack?
Oh no, that's not there
Are you there?
What about cucumber packs or potato packs?
Wow I've never done that before
My mom often does that
Wow, the effect is good, right?
Yeah, they say that if you use a potato pack when your skin gets tanned, it's effective.
Have you ever been hospitalized?
Yeah, I just did it once
Was that hospital room okay?
It was a 6-person room, but it wasn't that great ㅠㅠ
It's harder when it's noisy ㅜㅜ
The lady next door was talking on the phone even though it was past 11 at night.
Wow that's serious. Was the hospital a big place?
Yeah, it was a university hospital, so the scale itself was huge.
Have you ever been hospitalized due to a car accident?
Oh my, I've never had that happen before ㅠㅠ

I did it recently
Oh, when was the last time?
Are you okay now?
april?
Oh, it's been a long time. I was hospitalized for about a week!
Health health now
What kind of treatment did you receive?
Since it's a Korean medicine clinic, I got acupuncture and chiropractic treatment.
Have you ever been hit by a needle?
Yeah I like herbal medicine
Are you the type to buy water?
Yeah, but it's not delivery, I buy it myself
Do you mainly deliver food ingredients?
Because I don't eat wellㅠ
Did you use Coupang Food Ingredients?
I used to order from Coupang every day when they had a free trial for their Wow Membership.
Have you ever ordered from Coupang?
I signed up for membership, but I don't really use it.
Have you ever used WeMakePrice?
Yeah, only when there's a special offer!

Sometimes! It shows up on places like WeMakePrice and Timon.
What did you buy at the event?
I think I bought a plane ticket!
Oh wow, have you ever used the food court?
What kind of site is Foodjang?
If you look at it broadly, it's a place that sells meat, but they also have all kinds of food!
If you have something to do, come check it out
Oh, and the delivery is fast too?
Have you seen actress Kim Go-eun cut her hair?
Oh, how did you cut it?
Did you originally have long hair?
I had long hair, but I shortened my bangs and the back of my hair to take pictures of Yumi's cells!
so cute
Have you ever seen a drama?
Oh no!
Actually, I don't really like actress Kim Go-eun haha
Oh, who is your favorite actor?
Female actor or male actor?
Oh, then among the female actors~?
I like actress Jun Ji-hyun as a female actor
Then what about male actors~?
The male actor has been obsessed with Koo Kyo-hwan after watching DP these days...
Wow, did you see that picture of the old boyfriend actor moving away?
Oh my gosh Kiki was so funny
Who is your favorite male actor?
I'm learning a new sound every time, but now it's suddenly Pio
Oh, now Pio is called an actor too

The bodyguard role in Dokjeon was also cool
Who was he?
I don't remember
What was that Seonhee? Oh, is that the name in the play?
Haha I don't know
There's a *** actor there too. Do you like him?
Wow, really... I really like that person's voice tone.
And is it true that you are in your 50s...?
So does that make sense, that beauty?
I remember last time you took a picture of the back of actor *** and asked if we were a couple Kiki
Oh right, Kiki is almost as old as my mom.
That's right, it's amazing. As expected, the management is amazing.
*** Do you like actors?
Yeah, I totally fell in love with it after seeing it on TV, whether it was Eungpal or Eungchil...
Wow, I figured that out too...
**It goes well with that too

Oh, how did you know?
I stole it from Instagram

The makgeolli was delicious, but the side dishes were just so-so
What did you eat for a snack?
The side dishes are kimchi pancake and pork belly spicy noodles
What kind of makgeolli is it?
Just that brand of makgeolli!
Did the combination work well?

There aren't many convenience stores or bicycle rental shops, right?
Oh, do you want to try working at the Han River?
Yeah no
Are you too busy?
Me too, not really...
So where do you want to try it?
I'm in front of the house!
Do you want to try something nearby?

Almost all of them worked shifts?

Open afternoon closing like this
Have you ever wanted to go to an interview?
Um, I haven't had anyone so precious go to the military yet.
My friend is in the army and he cries almost every day because he can't get a vacation.
You can just go to the interview
I thought he was a career soldier and should be out and about instead of meeting people.
Oh, so interviews aren't allowed at all?
But because of Corona, I can't go out, so I heard that all outings and visits are blocked due to Corona.
Oh right
My friend was also really frustrated
Where does that guy work?
Yongin! Around Everland
Ah, you go out and play!
Yeah, so I decided to go in the middle of this month.
Oh my, is that your boyfriend?
Goya, are you coming to pick me up?
No, but she's my high school friend...?
Female soldier? Army? Awesome
Wow, that's cool!
But his original dream was to be a soldier

When I was in elementary school...?
Maybe my teacher in 6th grade?
How are you, brother?

Oh my, what do you call me?
Just call me oppa
Why do you look so annoying?
Don't you have a fantasy about your brother?
Oh yeah I totally do
What would you like to do if you had an older brother?
A brother who plays well with his younger sibling!
What about that older brother who treats you like shit?
? I want to be your older sister. I want to be your older sister too.
What other siblings do you wish you had?
I think I'd like a sister
Are you trying to steal my clothes and wear them?
Wow, I think we could be friends!
I'm jealous of that too
How many children do you want to have when you get married?
There are three of us! Absolutely!
Are we going to raise the children together?
Oh, of course we should do it together.
My baby?
Is there a reason there are three?
I want to raise my youngest daughter as my brother's daughter and receive complete love.
Oh, you can be any gender you want.
So...
Actually, it's not like I can do whatever I want...
Do you want to work with your husband?
Yeah, I think I need to work to be able to raise my voice.

Well, I'm not lonely
Don't leave the poem alone
If you raise a rabbit, you won't have time to be bored.
The rabbit must be really crazy
If you keep running around like that, shouldn't you go and catch it?
Do rabbits go to the bathroom on their own?
They say that if you raise fish, the cost of the fish tank is no joke.
Do you know how much?
Fish tank price? Isn't it just a glass box?
I asked because I didn't know...
I don't know either ㅠㅠ
Because I was too young
Oh, you raised it?
How many?
There were so many little friends!
Did you have all the names?
How do you name it? ㅠㅠ
There were really a lot
Your family is rich... so cool
Kiki no
They were really friends as small as anchovies
Are Taekwondo uniforms white or black?
What do you really see me as?
Hey, you can't just let it slide
I don't want to say anything because my pride is hurt
How many of those are sticking out of the sole of your soccer shoes?
...? You know that?
I don't know Kiki
Have you ever worn volleyball shoes?
I just found out that there are separate volleyball shoes
Volleyball shoes don't slip and they're secretly pretty!
Oh, you looked into buying it too?
Students applying to physical education colleges must wear volleyball shoes and exercise!
Oh really?
Running and things like that too?
When you jump forward, jump up, run, etc., you don't slip!
The floor looks different
Oh, what does it look like?
Should I call it rubber? It squeaks on the gym floor.
Oh, like that tire squeak?
Is there anyone around you who is as good at games as professional gamers?
Kiki, it doesn't seem to be that much
I'm not good at games either ㅠㅠ

Oh, right
Santa and the Pirate
Wow, pirates are so fast
Yeah, yeah
Was it Rodumani? He's a very fast and strong guy.
As soon as possible
Wow, that king breaking map is fun too!
Was it a monster battle?
Doing it together?
As soon as possible
When I say bye bye to the king, I have my own skill
Oh then then Kiki
We almost memorized the map
Have you ever traveled on a Hana Tour?
Oh no?
Are you talking about the package?
Oh my, they advertise that a lot.
Oh, have you been there?
One tour?
My dad went to China with his friends on a package tour and he was satisfied!
Oh China?
But these days, travel agencies are having a hard time because of the coronavirus.
I also went on a college graduation trip to Thailand as part of a tour!
We didn't have a graduation trip ㅠㅠ
My friend was working at a travel agency when the coronavirus started... I was on paid leave, but they said they would start accepting new employees in December, so I received unemployment benefits. ㅜㅜ
Oh really ㅠㅠ?
There's a rumor that all the part-time workers at cafes around Gimpo Airport these days are flight attendants.
I heard that you already have a house and are working part-time around the house ㅜㅜ
That's why ㅠㅠ
Is there a place you want to travel to?
I want to go to Italy haha
Oh, Italy~ When you go there, you eat pasta
It seems like a schedule that would require me to quit my job and go...
But we can't go abroad because we haven't been vaccinated.
Do you watch when it thunders?
No, it's scary ㅠㅠ thump thump
Are you the type of person who can't stay home alone when it thunders?
Not to that extent ㅠㅠ
Because I'm scared of loud noises
You are such a sweetheart~
Don't ignore me, Mr. Wooi
Do you like thunder?
I love thunder so much that I just go out to watch it.
Yeah, that's a little scary
Am I scary?
Are you afraid of thunder?
you are...?
So, do you like rainy days too?

Ugh, I hate it too
It's just an excuse to eat buchimgae.
What do you eat when it snows?
When it snows, sweet potatoes and dongchimi
Do you want to have a snowball fight with me?
Can't we make a snowman in peace?
Did you know that these days, you can apply for unemployment benefits in 5 parts?
Unemployment benefits too?
Are you following the corona relief fund?
Originally, you could go and apply freely, but since there were so many, they decided to do it in 5 parts...
Oh, so that's how many people got cut off?
That's right
The unemployment rate continues to rise, and the youth unemployment rate also rises.
This is so frustrating ㅠㅠ
I'm grateful that I'm working at this level...
Yeah, me too...
I'm thankful that I wasn't hit hard by Corona.
They say that now people who have received their second dose of the vaccine will be able to travel abroad!
But these days, there are a lot of people who don't get a second chance.
Did you apply for the National Mutual Consumption Support Fund this time?
Oh, I'm applying for that tomorrow!
Did you have any big expenses between April and June?
April-June? Hmm, I don't think there was any.
Any big expenses coming up in October?
Going to Jeju Island in October?
Have you seen the Japanese news?
Why Japan?
What happened?
They said that the vaccination rate is over 60%
What kind of article is this?
I tried it with a soccer fan.
experiment...?
Experimenting with human lives?
Instead, those who have been vaccinated or not must submit a negative test result to be able to view the show.
What is that...
I'm scared so I don't want to do it
There are countries that have stopped vaccinating Moderna because it is not suitable for the young generation.
Does that have anything to do with age?
I think Moderna originally said it was strong in the 50s!
I think my parents got Pfizer.
Norway is even recommending Pfizer.
Oh, Norway knows something
My parents also got Pfizer
At that time, there was a shortage of Moderna.
But there's a rumor that the Pfizer president hasn't gotten the Pfizer shot yet.
When are you going to dye your hair?
I'm thinking about dyeing my hair next week
What color do you want?
Well, I'm just going to bleach the inside a little bit.
Oh, you're getting an popular haircut?
Let me join the ranks of popular kids too
Have you ever bleached your hair?
No, I've never done it before.
you?
I tried it, but it seems to feel very different depending on the medicine.
People say that their scalps are itchy
That's what happens to people with weak scalps!
Oh really?
Maybe my scalp is weak too
Do you go to the hair salon and have the hairdresser dye your hair?
Yeah, I've never bleached my hair before, so I'm going to go to the hair salon.
Joa, be wise and come out pretty~
I have a lot of hair so it's hard to do it alone ㅠㅠ
Have you been hospitalized recently?
Not recently!
Did you have a car accident? ㅠㅠ
Yeah! And I almost got hospitalized again because I had a cyst on my knee!
So you're not doing surgery after all?
I guess I'll have to wait 6 months
It can swell up again!
Do you know why that happened?
Oh my god, how did this happen? ㅠㅠ
I just fell down on the floor with a thud! and my knee got wet. Kiki
I thought it was a bruise, but it didn't go away Kiki
Oh my... I fell over while doing something ㅠㅠ
Be careful
I fall down so often!
You can throw away your ankles and go around like this, almost without needing to worry about anything!
If you sprain your ankle once, it will keep spraining ㅠㅠ
So see more but
I had surgery on my lower back too!
What kind of treatment is done on your waist?
You are a total general hospital ㅠㅠ
I went to a university demonstration team MT and received AT during a face-to-face meeting, but my disc ruptured. Do you know why I wasn't admitted to the hospital right away?
Oh my gosh, at a university face-to-face meeting?
I got injured in early April, but I had to do a sports competition demonstration in mid-May, so they told me to be hospitalized after that. I was barely able to get hospitalized after the sports competition demonstration.
But after I was hospitalized!
Did the seniors make a fuss again?
Which do you think is cheaper, online or offline?
Aren't there more discounts online?
I think it's because labor costs are excluded!
Are you the type of person who compares prices before buying?
Well, if you like something, just buy it!
Wow cool dude with no price comparison!
Kiki, that's why I always seem to pay more ㅠㅠ
It's a limited edition! If I tell you, will you buy it right away?
Um no, there's no such thing Kiki
I put it in my cart, but there's only one left! Should I buy it right away when I get the text?
Oh my, I have to buy that
If not, you'll regret it
If you have something to return, do you usually just return it?
I don't do that very often because it's annoying ㅠㅠ
How much is the return fee okay?
Um, 5 thousand won?
Round trip shipping fee is okay.
But returning it is such a hassle ㅜㅜ
Right ㅠㅠ
What should I write and contact the shopping mall?
Doesn't the chemistry between the Sixth Sense members just seem great?
Oh yeah right ㅠㅠ
Miju is so cute
Do you know why there are almost no female guests on Six Senses?
Oh, I see
It felt like there were only members there almost every day
The members are so close that when a guest leaves, it feels like I'm alone at a girls' high school.
Everyone refused
Yeah, Kiki, but it was a really unexpected combination.
Yeah, I was a bit skeptical when I first saw it, but it was really surprising
I didn't know that Jessie and Onara would get along so well
that's right
I used to only see Oh Nara as an actor, but when she appeared on a variety show, it felt different.
Oh right
I was quite impressed by Sky Castle
Six Sense is over, what should I do now~?
Oh, Six Sense is over?
I didn't know because I don't have a TV
My love, New Journey to the West is here~
Scream out loud~
Oh, a new season of New Journey to the West is coming out?
New Journey to the West is already 9~
Shout louder~
Wow, this looks like it'll be really fun
Have you read the webtoon Yumi's Cells?
Yeah, I only saw it as a webtoon
When did you see the webtoon?
Have you seen it for quite some time?
I watched it from beginning to end
Wow my friend saw it in 2015
You too?
Oh, that was serialized since 2015?
That was also exhibited until May 21st ㅜㅜ
Oh, right
It was exhibited in Seochon
I want it so badly, but it's already over...
I should have gone to see Kiki together
Can you please open it again?
I'll contact the author
Actually, I may not have been interested at the time...
I'm so lost right now... save me
There was a rumor that he also bought emoticons.
That's exactly true!
Yeah, the cells are so cool haha
I'm just putting money in the writer's account.
Sister, did you say you ate pizza yesterday?
I ate all the pizza and chicken
Oh, where did you order it?
Have you tried Pizza Nara Chicken Princess?
Iguram
I've been eating there since I was little
Did you have that when you were young? That?
Yeah, yeah, so I remember ordering it at my birthday party.
It would be good to order this for a birthday party.
Correct answer!
What do you want to eat most on your birthday?
I like japchae
Japchae made by mom
Wow, I want to eat japchae these days too
You too? Me too?
Hey me too!
They say that making japchae is actually easy.
It doesn't take long to prepare the ingredients...
Oh, that's right
That's the hardest part...
If you're good at that, you're actually a chef~
I want to live alone soon too
When are you thinking of coming out?
Once the next company is decided, I have to leave now.
Are you moving closer to the company?
yes
I want to be close to you now ㅜㅜ
What do you want to do between jeonse and monthly rent?
I'm going to live comfortably in a rented house for two years now...
Doesn't the monthly rent feel too homey...?
Yeah, I just don't like it...
Even when I go into the house, it feels like someone else's house
right
It's also a bit inconvenient to decorate the house
that's right
I keep thinking that I'll only live here for a year and then leave ㅜㅜ
Once it's decided, I need to find a place to rent quickly.
But I'm worried because I heard that there aren't many rentals these days
They say it's different in each neighborhood, but are you looking at the metropolitan area?
I have no intention of leaving the metropolitan area...
Then it must be expensive ㅜㅜ
My friend came to pick me up after work on Friday.
Wow, you have a friend like that?
Yeah, my friend who lives in Nowon came to pick me up in his car from Yeoksam.
Is this your first time driving home from work?
that's right...
It was so sweet
It was so comfortable
If you drive to Seoul, you'll get stuck in traffic.
that's right
I was scared too, but luckily he was from Seoul so there was no problem!
thank god
It's really great to go home from work on a Friday in Seoul.
that's right
He showed me the car he bought, and it was really nice.
Is the car big?
Yeah yeah
The back seat is really nice because you can fold down the seat and sleep in it.
If you sleep in a carnival, it's just a dump
These days, the car looks definitely bigger because it has a 6-seater.
The carnival actually looks big on the outside...
that's right
I was driving down the road and both sides were packed.
You must be a good driver.
Try practicing driving with it.
Sister, have you ever worked as a contract worker?
I don't have any, I'm always a freelancer
I got a job offer yesterday from the field I was working in before.
Oh my gosh
Security side? Security side?
where?
Security!
I heard my contract ends in December, so I'm going to Deku Kiki
Are you someone we worked with before?
Not our team's leader, but another team's leader!
What did you say the conditions were?
I said it was okay, so I'll give you a year's salary in advance. Stay with me for a long time.
Is it strong?
Are you the type of person who knows that you won't eat or drink money?
Kiki, I told you I threw away all my bodyguard clothes.
that's right
You bought millions of won worth of those and threw them all away as soon as you quit your job.
that's right...
Kiki said he bought it all for me
These are good conditions, so what do you think?
Security is so good and the work is fun, but I don't think I can change my life again...
right
You said you only had two days off in a month
Did you go to Suwon to meet your sister's friend yesterday?
I went to see my friend in the army
You've come a long way, Kiki
Did you say female soldier?
Yeah yeah
Cool lady
All soldiers are cool
You seem so amazing...
Aren't there any female soldiers around you?
Yeah, there's one from the Navy and one from the Army.
It's not easy to have female soldiers around you, but there are two of you who have been discharged?
right
I'm curious too
If you're among them, you'll hear a lot about the military.
Oh, I think I've already been there
What did they talk about?
First of all, I think I'll fit in well if I join the military. 32,546 times?
That much Kiki
Just to see their will, give it a try...
Kiki I guess I have about 2 years left now
very good
Let's try it
Have you ever attended a government-funded educational institution?
I don't have any
Do you have a lot?
After graduating from college, I went to two academies, quit my job, and went to two more.
This is the first time I've seen so many people around me go to academies.
Kiki is trying to write it on her resume
It may feel like you're wasting time, but it's a good use of that time.
yes
I tried my best to be careful
Which academy was the most difficult among them?
Accounting was the most interesting to me, but it was also difficult.
How did you end up studying accounting?
Since I like math, my mom recommended it to me and I went right away!
Well done
Aren't there any academies that make portfolios?
that's right
The video editing academy even created a portfolio at the end.
This is my first time making it. How is it?
Now I'm going to watch the broadcast and edit it, but I'm just going to watch it
Ah, I guess I'll have to try it myself to find out
What is the age difference between your aunt and uncle?
Mom and Dad are 2 years apart
Oh, my mom and dad are 1 year old.
They say that when you get married, the age difference between you and your parents will be much larger.
Oh really? Oh, I guess so.
Have you ever met someone who is one year older than you?
I'm fast, so when I meet friends, they're all one year older than me. Kiki
When did you go to see your third aunt?
I haven't been doing well lately ㅜㅜ
What about your sister?
I drove my car around a few days ago.
Oh, good job. Did you get back safely?
Yeah, the road there is rough so I'm always worried, but I had a good trip.
Have you done your share too?
Then you've done your share too
I'll be a Deku later too
Let's go together before the year ends
When do you want to get married?
I wanted to do it before I was 30, but I'm already 29
Wow, time really flies
I wonder if I can get married
Me too me too Kiki
I'm thinking of living alone
When do you want to do it?
I don't want to do it
These days, there are many people who want to date but not get married.
that's right
That's me
But the reality is that neither of them are doing it?
Correct answer
You too? Me too?
Hey me too!
Do you have an ideal type these days?
I want someone who matches my lifestyle and doesn't leave me lonely.
Wow that's important
Yeah, yeah
I always had a hard time because my lifestyle didn't match up with mine.
It's really important, the pattern
I want to raise an iguana
Have you actually seen it?
Haha no
I haven't seen it yet
Have you ever seen a chameleon?
Not at all
Do you have a sister?
Me neither Kiki
If you raise an iguana, what will you name it?
I want to name it Chameleon
what
Are you being insincere?
no way
How much I've been worried
You didn't just think about it?
You don't trust me? Huh?
okay
Leon, I'll believe you.
I'll send you a picture when I raise it.
I want to raise it within 20 years
Oh my god
You know me so well
You're too busy to raise me
I want to learn basketball
Have you ever played basketball?
I learned it when I was taking physical education for the college entrance exam
Are you learning the game?
no
There are schools that only look at the shooting posture~
There is something like that
What did you learn?
I learned layup shots and basket shots.
How do you test your shot from under the basket?
Test how many goals you can score in a certain amount of time.
Oh, is that worth doing?
I always get full marks!
So, did you do well on the test?
No Kiki
The school I went to for the exam didn't have basketball.
Oh, that's too bad
You said it was perfect ㅜㅜ
yes
I guess this is my fate
It's nice to see you pass it over so coolly
Have you seen the game I played in high school?
You played a lot of games back then
Ahem...
Have you seen any soccer games?
Oh, you looked so excited when you did that.
I used to play FIFA 2
How was it?
I do that often
It's so funny Kiki just tackled me
Does it also have a tackle function?
I used to get in trouble with my friends because I was always hurting players because of my tackles.
Oh, can I do this with my friends too?
Yeah yeah
When you're with friends, use tackle, but when you're with strangers, don't use tackle.
Is that considered manners?
Those who are good at it will also be good at tackling.
If not, what if the players get injured?
yes
It's a shortcut to getting cursed at a lot
It's a shortcut to living a long life.
I'm going to Jeju Island this week.
Wow I'm jealous
Who are you going with?
I'm going with a friend
I heard that there are a lot of reservations and a lot of people in Jeju Island during the National Foundation Day and Hangeul Day holidays.
that's right
So you have to be more careful haha
Have you finished making your rental reservation?
Yeah, I made a reservation at Kona.
Did the two of you make the plan?
Yeah yeah
We made plans for where we both wanted to go.
What's the first thing you do when you go?
Since I'm leaving after work, I'll go straight to my accommodation...
Are you going to go straight to your accommodation and sleep?
Anning
I decided to do my friend's nails.
Oh, the first plan is to open a shop.
It's free because you're a VIP guest~
Wow I want to be a VIP too
They said it was going to rain today, so why am I doing laundry?
It's a holiday so I have to do laundry too
that's right
I thought this was the time so I just turned it on...
It's getting dark soon
that's right
It's dark when I get home from work
The days suddenly got shorter
So, if I leave work in the winter, it will be dark as soon as I get out of the office.
It seems like it'll get dark even in November...
There really isn't much left
It's about time a typhoon comes
I know
But I thought there was no typhoon damage in our neighborhood in Incheon.
Oh really?
Never been there before?
no
There was
The window of an officetel about 10 minutes away fell out.
Wow, it's strong?
No one got hurt?
It was late so there was no one passing by.
Wow, that's really fortunate
Have you checked the number of confirmed coronavirus cases?
I used to see it every day, but not so much these days... Why?
Even after step 4, there were still 2,000 people
Wow, hasn't it been a long time since the metropolitan area was put on level 4?
that's right
But now it's been two days since 2,000 people fell.
Still, it's a good thing we fell apart
But I heard there are usually fewer people on weekends...
When does it come out the most?
Oh, they said it was Wednesday!
Why is it Wednesday...?
Mid Wednesday?
Those who went out on the weekend will have to get tested before Wednesday
Oh, I see
Because I move around a lot on weekends
Oh, that's right
That's correct~
I didn't think of that
When will it end
Now, it seems like saying &quot;let's see you after Corona is over&quot; is meaningless...
Now there is no more expectation
Have you seen the Italian news?
Why? What's going on in Italy?
Italy says all workers must be vaccinated
Wow, all the workers?
Is that okay?
Um... so there's a protest going on
How many people are protesting?
Ten thousand people protested in the streets
So if I don't get vaccinated, I'll be fired?
It's not a dismissal, it's a suspension without pay.
what
Is this your own unpaid leave?
That's why it's so scary
I can't make a living without getting vaccinated...
It's too coercive to eliminate jobs...
scary...
Seems like something worth protesting about
that's right
therefore...
too bad
I hope it works out well
Is there an area you would like plastic surgery on?
I want to get thigh liposuction
I heard that really hurts...
Is there anyone around you?
He said he was getting married and had liposuction on his arms and legs.
Oh, that's great...
Are you strong in both places?
right
I would never recommend it because it really hurts
Is there a place you would like to have plastic surgery on?
I want to do it all from head to toe, down to my toes
Ah, out of all the Kiki faces, the one I want to do the most!
I have a nose ㅜㅜ
I want to get a nose reduction surgery
Do you think your nose is big?
I've never liked my nose since I was little.
They say that the nose is the best for changing your image.
that's right
But once you get your nose done, you have to get it done at least twice.
I heard that revision surgery costs more?
Sister, have you ever had surgery?
I'm actually pretty healthy, so I've never been hospitalized.
Wow, awesome
It's really good
Have you ever had surgery?
Um, back surgery and nail removal?
Why are the claws like that?
I should have gone to the hospital right away because I touched it wrong...
Didn't you go right away?
Don't your toenails hurt?
Yeah, that's right
I'm sick, but I don't tell people I'm sick...
Wow, you were just holding it in without saying anything?
So I got scolded by my mom and the doctor.
I deserve to be single
If you're sick, you should go right away ㅜ
I don't seem to feel pain very well...
Huh...? Is that an advantage...?
Is it good?
Is it good...?
I don't know either, well
Now go to the hospital regularly!
Zigzag is giving out coupons these days
that's right
They give out coupons really often
The coupons have some strict conditions, but it's safe to have them.
that's right
Even if you don't have a photo, it's still helpful
Have you tried Carrot Market?
That's the basics of living alone.
What have you done this year?
I sell a lot of things I don't need and buy things I need right away.
That thing even has a temperature, Kiki
Yeah, that's right
Haven't you tried it?
I... am still awkward with direct transactions
Have you ever done something like this on Joonggonara?
I often do second-hand transactions with courier companies.
Have you never done a direct transaction before?
Yeah... I love delivery...
It's comfortable without seeing faces
Sister, have you seen Dr. Slee?
Did you do that up to season 2?
Yeah, that's right
Have you seen it?
I haven't finished watching season 2 yet
Is that finished?
Yeah, it's over, but the members started a variety show together!
Oh, what's the name of the show?
Smart mountain village life!
The chemistry is good
The name sounds like the old Three Meals a Day?
As expected, if you pretend to be a jerk, you are a jerk
Then maybe the director too?
Oh my, you're so smart
Who could it be~
Correct answer!
PD Na Young-seok!
That's absolutely correct~
Smart
When will PD Na rest?
therefore
The entertainment never stops...
Your determination is truly amazing...
Have you read the webtoon Yumi's Cells?
I've seen it before
Wow, everyone saw it except me
You didn't see that?
Uh... I've never read a webtoon...
Then how did you know that?
Oh, the drama started
Many webtoons are made into dramas or movies.
that's right
There was a movie called Fashion King before.
I think the author himself made a cameo appearance there?
Oh, Mr. Gian84 himself?
He said he appeared at the director's suggestion.
Oh my gosh
It's okay!
Did you know that webtoons are paid?
Wow, that's crazy
I'm going to sweep up some money
Correct answer
But you end up paying for it secretly...
What did you eat for dinner last night?
I ate chicken last night hehe
Wow, that must have been delicious
What brand did you eat?
Grilled chicken!
Do you like grilled chicken?
Wow, I love this restaurant!
What kind of chicken do you like the most at Goobne?
I like spicy basil
Wow, I also love spicy basil
Let's eat together
Was the steamed dumplings I ordered from your house last time okay?
Oh, are you talking about that Rose Jjimdak?
Oh my, it was delicious, wasn't it?
Yeah, yeah, it tasted like something I wanted to mix with rice and eat.
Let's order again!
Okay, okay. Let's add some Chinese noodles and eat it this time.
Added a whole lot more!
This time, let's make fried rice too!
Do you have a lot of furniture at home?
I'm greedy, but I'm holding back because my house is small.
Do you have a sofa at home?
No ㅠㅠ
I really want to buy a sofa
Do you tend to think about the interior when you buy anything?
of course!
I went back and looked at my house in 3D
Do you even care about the colors when you buy them?
Okay then
Color combinations are not important
What color is it now?
It was originally beige with wood tones, but we added green to it!
Oh, the green interior is amazing
Are you talking about that wallpaper?
Yeah, I put up wallpaper recently
Wow you did this alone?
Yeah, it was so hard doing it myself ㅠㅠ
Is that just something you put on?
Luckily, I bought it in sheet form, so I just had to peel off the stickers and stick them on!
Which is more convenient, the subway or the bus?
I like buses!
you?
Me too bus!
Why do you like it?
I like looking out the window and just sitting comfortably.
Me too me too
When changing trains, how many times do you check and get on again?
When I have free time, I watch, and when I don't, I just ride anywhere
What is the longest time you've ridden the subway?
Um, almost two hours? Two and a half hours?
Wow, where have you been?
When my brother was in high school, it was a boarding school.
Oh, where is that location?
Positive station!
This is my first time hearing this
Wow, awesome
What line is it?
Kiki on the Gyeongui Central Line
Totally far away
Wow, this is so unfamiliar
That's right in the Yangpyeong area
Does your current company often have company dinners?
Before Corona, I used to do it once or twice a month
Is this an atmosphere where you absolutely cannot miss company dinners?
no way
No, haha
I feel quite free!
Do you drink a lot when you go?
They don't force you to drink alcohol either!
Who usually leads company dinners?
Sir!
Actually, everyone except the director finds it annoying...
Are you getting your salary on time?
Oh, that's totally a knife!
The time zone is random, but the date is a knife
That's fortunate
Did you get along well when you interned there?
Oh no...
Back then, the owner would put it in himself, so it was always bumpy.
Wow... the date is the same?
The dates are also completely random...
I was really annoyed back then ㅠㅠ
Wow, salary is important, but it's so sad...
That's why
Money matters the most!
Do you know how much soldiers get paid?
Oh no
They say it went up a lot, but it's still really low ㅠㅠ?
I think so ㅜㅜ
Have you ever been to the 17th Division?
Where is the 17th Division?
Is it toward Songnae Station?
There's a 17th division in Songnae!
Yeah yeah
Did you see it in passing?
Yeah yeah
I've always seen it in passing.
My friend said he was there
Wow, you're coming from the 17th Division of the Army. That's great for when you're on vacation!
right
But it's the metropolitan area?
But the fact that that friend's hometown is Daegu is a trap
When you go on vacation, the distance you move is important.
Huh...? I didn't know that
Still, it was comfortable to come and meet friends, Kiki
Oh, I see, Kiki
Did you know that there is a shorthand disease?
Are there stenographers in the military?
Oh, this is my first time hearing this
There are separate soldiers who do stenography work, just like a chauffeur drives.
Oh, there's a special agent like that too...
Is that more comfortable?
Look, all training is the same!
Oh, that's a bit disappointing ㅠㅠ
Are you preparing for the certification next year?
I think I'll prepare it in the year after next
I thought the certificate announcement date would never come, but it's coming soon...
Real price
Oh, I see...
I'm going to be so nervous
Ugh, this is a day I wish would never come...
Where are the results?
By text? On the website?
It's on the homepage!
At 10 o'clock!
Wow, my hands have been shaking since the day before...
Don't be surprised if I don't hear from you on the 12th...
Oh my...
Still, I prepared hard and I have no regrets!
that's right!
I feel so comfortable because everyone cheers me on
I will also pray with water from today
Hehehe thank you
If you stick to it, it's my fault if you lose your favor
Huh, no
Then I won't pray
If you fall, it's my fault!
Ana Kiki
all good
Anything that sells should be done early
Are you preparing for any other certifications after that?
My mom went to Wonju yesterday~
Oh, do you have free time now?
Yeah! So I drank free alcohol
Ah, where did Kiki's father go!
Dad went to work~
Mother, why did you go to Wonju?
I went to my aunt's house to play!
Oh, I guess you're on good terms with your aunt!
I heard that the two of you used to live alone!
How old is your mother among your siblings?
Um, my mom is the second child~
Oh, so your aunt is the eldest?
That's correct!
How old is your mother?
My mom is the eldest daughter!
right
Are you second too?
Yeah, I'm second too!
One brother above
Would you like to be introduced to a guy?
Oh, are you getting a boyfriend?
Would you like to contact me?
Who is the person you want me to introduce you to?
You're my friend. I like your picture.
Oh yeah
I'll contact you
I hope things work out for you two!
If things go well, I'll buy a gift for the person who introduced me. What should I buy?
Oh, there's something like that?
Let me introduce you quickly
Is this because of the gift?
Oh my gosh
I'm not that bad
right?
Did I misunderstand?
Yeah haha
I hope it goes well
But now I like long-term relationships
right
I'm tired of fighting now...
that's right
The emotional consumption was too great
Is there anyone around you who has a dog?
A lot
Are you around?
Come to think of it, I raised everyone around me except myself...
Are you only raising puppies?
No cats?
Oh, you have a cat, and another friend of mine has a cat that he's been raising for a long time.
What's that cat's name?
I heard it was Nari, but it's weird
Show me the pictures later
I want to see other cats
Then I'll go see your cat
Our cat has actually seen it a lot, right?
that's right
Is this cat really into people?
I especially like you
Somehow I almost felt loved last time
that's right
That's it
But when my friends came, they really liked it
Is this a situation where strangers are welcome?
I know
I really like people
I saw a baby wearing a dobok a few days ago and he was so cute.
My child looks really cute in a dobok.
I'm sure there were times like that too, right...?
How old were you when you started doing Taekwondo?
I was a baby too, since I was 7 years old
Yeah, that's right
Have you been practicing Taekwondo regularly?
I liked Taekwondo so much that I went twice a day.
Wow, you go to school twice a day?
Yeah, I was bored at home because both my husband and I worked and no one was home ㅜㅜ
Then it will be even more so
Well done
Is Taekwondo only about fighting?
Well, there's competition and form~
I've never seen anything like this before
Actually, there is a competition, but it's not like it's a competition, so you won't see it on TV~
It felt somehow unfamiliar
right
But when you see someone who is good at posture, it's no joke...
I'll have to see you next time
Send me a link
Let's play a round of Halli Galli
I feel like I'm really going to hit you
Uh... Well, if you play that game, your hands will actually burst
that's right
Trying to press each other quickly
That's why your palms hurt when you touch them Kiki
That's right
My hands are going to break
Even if your hands hurt, it's fun to play harley galley
Actually, it's fun when it hurts
It reminds me of the old ABC game
That also hurts my palm so much...
My hand hurt a lot while doing that.
But even though I knew it, I still did it
I did it a lot when I was in school
that's right
I did a lot of air at school, and I tore my legs apart.
that's right
It was so flexible back then
It was so much fun tearing my legs apart and letting out some air
We're going to Jeju Island next week.
So it's a late vacation
Everyone was jealous
that's right
Instead, we endured the summer vacation well.
I really held out for October back then
that's right
Let's go to Jeju Island and have fun
Okay, so that's my plan for the first and second days, right?
Yes, the third and fourth are my days
It could have taken a lot of time even with the plan, but luckily
It seems like it was really a godsend to knit it separately
that's right
They don't overlap and are perfect
It's really well written
But there aren't many parking lots in Jeju Island.
that's right
It took me a long time to find that too
The parking lots are all narrow ㅜㅜ
Parking lot is important, you know.
Now that it's raining, fall is coming
Is the weather coming?
It's time for the coat
If you miss this moment, you won't be able to wear it.
If I'm not careful, winter will come
that's right
I need to take out my coat right now
It'll be 9 degrees next Sunday.
Wow, already?
No, there are four seasons?
therefore
I guess I should say two now
Later on, the seasons disappeared, so we had to express them through songs.
So, is spring the cherry blossom ending?
yes
I think I can explain the seasons that disappear like that.
Okay, I guess so
Let's enjoy it often before spring and fall disappear
Have you done anything at home to prepare for the typhoon?
Oh, I stuck a newspaper on the window.
you?
I also put it on the veranda window, but the typhoon didn't come...
Oh, you had a hard time?
There's already a presidential election next year.
therefore
Time really flies
When I see things like that, time flies
that's right
I'm getting old quickly
Have you seen that Paris Baguette?
What kind of things do you have?
Paris Baguette went on strike
Oh my gosh?
what's the matter?
I think ordering raw fish was difficult even before that
Bread made with raw materials coming from that factory?
yes
It was difficult to order, so the bosses got it themselves
Wow, then how do you continue with that...
Of course, the head office should be responsible for it ㅜㅜ
So it's still going on?
Yeah, that's right
They say they've stopped taking cake orders now.
Then you don't sell cakes?
I heard that our country's ramen used to be popular in Mexico.
usually?
Are you saying not now?
Ah, Kiki, do you have that spicy chicken stir-fried noodles?
Yeah, why is buldak delicious?
There were ramen noodles including that one
I was sobbing, but why?
It says there isn't a single chicken in the Buldak Bokkeum Myeon
It's fire chicken but there's no chicken?
Yeah yeah
As a result, they got rid of Korean ramen Buldak Bokkeummyeon as soon as it came out.
Wow, fast and accurate
I know
But that's shocking to us too
right
I know
Well, it's not really based on chicken, but on taste, but it's disappointing.
I would have been more disappointed if it had been a foreign product.
I know
I would have believed it and eaten it
Yeah, that's right
It's interesting that I even checked that
Oh, really?
I happened to check it
Have you ever been to a plastic surgeon?
No, there isn't any
you?
I went to a plastic surgeon and got my eyebrows and eyeliner tattooed.
Do they give tattoos at the hospital?
I went to a plastic surgeon and got my eyebrows and eyeliner tattooed.
Did you do both eyebrow and eyeliner?
Yeah, I went there believing it was a one-time use only.
Wow, doesn't that hurt?
My eyebrows are just itchy...
Oh... that's unexpected too
Eyeliner is dead dead
The pain level is no joke
Wow, is that it?
How much does it hurt
No kidding...
I don't want to do it again
How long does that tattoo last?
It's supposed to last about a year, but I've had it for over a year.
Oh, I guess you managed it well.
Have you ever received insurance money?
Yeah, Silvi has to ride it every time.
Oh, what did you ride?
When I had tonsil surgery before
Then there's more~?
I have to prepare for a broken leg this time too
Haven't you received it yet?
Yeah, I haven't received the receipt yet ㅠㅠ
Have you ever had acupuncture?
no
Is manual therapy also covered by insurance?
If you get acupuncture treatment and claim the cost, you will get the full amount minus ten thousand won.
Everything except 50 thousand won?
It's a jackpot
That's why I often get acupuncture treatment.
You try it too!
Does that make you feel better?
Yeah yeah
My thumb wasn't moving, but it got better after receiving consistent treatment!
Oh oh
I guess I have to spend money
I bought it from Coupang yesterday too
Oh, what did you order from Coupang?
I bought a moisturizing cream!
I'm so glad you came today
Have you heard about Coupang membership?
Oh, I tried that for free!
you?
Actually, I registered once and forgot to cancel, so I'm still using it.
I use Samsung Pay when I shop online, but iPhone doesn't have Samsung Pay?
But these days, Kakao Pay is used a lot, so it's okay!
There was a lot of talk about accumulating points with Kakao Pay, is that okay?
Oh, that thing where you put the Alpoint?
Yeah, yeah, I'm going to give you 2 points for doing something like that.
Yeah Kiki
The animation is just so loud
that's right
Minus in points!
Naver Pay has some really great points
Have you seen that they give you more if you recharge with Naver Pay?
Oh really?
But it was a bit burdensome because it was charged in units of ten thousand won.
I'm watching Knowing Brothers right now, and the time has changed?
Oh really?
What time was it originally?
It was originally supposed to be 10 o'clock, but now it's at the same time as Nolto!
Oh, are you going to fight with Nolto?
Oh, that's bold.
right
So this time, Eunhyuk, Donghae, Chanwon, and Youngtak appeared in the 300th episode special.
It's the second week that the ratings are expected to be announced
Oh, are those trot singers still popular these days?
Now that my contract with Chosun TV has ended, I feel like I can fly even higher!
Oh, there was a contract tied up there?
Sob sob
So I thought there was a show called Bongsunga Academy on Chosun TV
Ah, somehow ㅠㅠ
I said it just keeps coming out
So Lee Soo Geun congratulated me on not being a Joseon person anymore.
Kiki from Joseon
Make a traitor out of him
Lee Soo Geun is really funny
Didn't Shindong appear on Knowing Brothers recently?
Shindong is a regular teacher and will definitely appear in Part 2!
Oh, it's fixed now?
Looks like Super Junior is all together
I have a serious problem right now.
What is it? What is it? Tell me right now.
I want to read the webtoon Yumi's Cells, but it's paid starting from episode 34...
Hey Kiki, pay for that cookie
The one-time fee is 200 won
But there were hundreds of times...
If you buy those cookies in bulk, it's a little cheaper.
So I'm thinking about buying a comic book for the first time.
what do you think about it?
Wow, Kiki Yumi's cells are completely gone
The cells are so cute seriously seriously eww
You know late night wind is scarier
Yeah that's me
Kiki, aren't you going to start collecting goods like this?
I actually looked for goods too...
Kiki, there's so much goodies there!
If you buy all the comic books, it's about 40,000 won.
Oh really? It's not bad to keep.
What should I eat in Gangneung?
Yesterday, I had potato soup
So what did you eat today?
Coffee and bread this morning!
What did you eat for lunch?
Spicy soft tofu for lunch!
Oh, did you eat dinner?
Since I didn't have enough time for dinner, I ordered squid sundae to go!
Did you buy the squid sundae at the market?
Yeah, I waited in line to buy it
Is this a good restaurant?
What's your name?
What was the name...! It was a snack shop ㅠㅠ
Oh pass! What's the name of the soft tofu restaurant?
There was something about Pine Tree House, and I had to wait in line to eat there too ㅠㅠ
Wow, there were that many people in Gangneung?
Crazy, crazy, the soft tofu gelato is sold out.
Are you going home to Seoul now?
No, go home to Incheon! It's getting late.
Are you going to sleep with your family at your home in Incheon tomorrow?
Yeah, I think so
I miss my cat ㅠㅠ
How long has it been since you moved to Incheon?
Um, there... I think I moved when I was a fifth year college student...
Uh... how many bathrooms are there in the house?
Two... That was really convenient...
How many bathrooms did you have when you lived in Bucheon?
At that time, there was only one... So, when someone was washing, they had to hold back even if they were in a hurry...
My house has one right now, so I'm feeling that too ㅜㅜ
I feel like the number of bathrooms is secretly important.
How many rooms does the Incheon house have?
There are three rooms, but my brother and I all live out, so two are empty...
Mom, Dad, can you run a hobby room...?
Yeah, but neither of them really have any hobbies...
What are you taking from Gangneung to Incheon?
Intercity bus! There are so many people.
Did you reserve your bus ticket through the app?
Yeah, I was a little late too
How long do you think it will take?
Three hours and ten minutes! It will be almost ten when we arrive.
Is the car not blocked?
Not yet?
But I'm worried because it looks like it's going to rain soon
Do you have an umbrella?
Yeah, I have an umbrella!
I want to ask my dad to pick me up at the terminal
What do I have to take from the terminal to my house in Incheon?
Yeah, the traffic there is really inconvenient.
Is a taxi the answer...?
How much will it cost?
Oh, the moment I said &quot;daebak&quot;, I got a KakaoTalk message from my dad.
Oh my goodness, there's no bus that goes there in one go?
Yeah, probably not ㅠㅠ
My house is so far away
Do you work for a company that closes on public holidays?
Oh, then why don't you rest?
I'm going to take a rest too
I really like the company I'm taking a break from...
You have to work for a company that takes such obvious things for granted.
Do you also give me a statement when I get my paycheck?
They don't give it to you separately, but they'll give it to you if you ask!
How many times have you done year-end tax settlement?
I'm still a baby just once Kiki
Didn't you spit it out that one time?
Yeah, I think I got paid about twenty
Oh, do you think I can get it this time too?
Um, maybe? I always get the rat tail, but I use it as much as a dragon's head.
Me too me too haha did I say I have a vacation at the end of the year?
Yeah! About a week?
But that's all my years of service, hehe
What do you want to do this holiday season?
Yeah, I guess so...
What should I do to get a good reputation?
Have you ever been on a military base?
Oh right, how did you remember?
Where did you go?
I don't remember well ㅠㅠ Was it Yeoncheon?
Oh, you went to the army?
What kind of artillery unit was it...
Are you reacting like you see on the internet?
Hey, I had an idol experience for a moment
They say that you gain strength from performing. Is that true?
To think that even someone like me would be shouted at like this...
What song did you come with?
Was it bland with red velvet ice cream cake?
Wow, you danced well!
Come to think of it, I've never seen it
Kiki, when you enlist, I'll go to a comfort performance.
Oh, I can't thank you enough
I'll go with Yang Se-hyung
If I had the money to call Yang Se-hyung, I could call him a hundred times.
Do you know what certificate I prepared for last time but failed by one point?
Has something like that ever happened to you?
It's the first time I've failed a secretary qualification by a single point, and it really doesn't suit me.
Wow, that's not a person's medicine...
Now that I have taken the regular test, I don't have the confidence to take it again Kiki
If it's a regular test, how often is it?
It varies by region, but it happens about twice a week for about three months.
Ah, it varies from region to region...
I just found out
There are two in Incheon, one is open on Tuesdays and Sundays and the other is only open on Sundays.
Just because I want to take the test doesn't mean I can take it all ㅠㅠ
There weren't many seats available either...
These days, there are no seats because people go to Busan to take exams and stuff.
That's what they said, so I don't want to watch it~^^
Kiki: It was an unexpected test tour...
The exam is really first come first served Kiki
They said that you have to apply for the exam just like you would for a ticket.
Did you and your mother go out together today?
Yeah! Mom really liked it.
You might have thought it was a long time since you had a date with your daughter~ You even went to a good restaurant~
It was worth the big money
very good
I bet your mother was happy from start to finish.
You went on a vacation with your mother last time, right?
Oh, that's right, I went there for my mom's birthday.
I bet your mother liked it a lot back then too
I feel sorry and like it's too late to do it now.
Hey, what's there to be sorry about? The future is just the beginning.
So I hope your birthday doesn't come next year, Kiki
Huh...? Kiki, I have to give you bigger and bigger things now?
Kiki, that's right Kiki, I'm just kidding. I still don't have an idea what to give you for your birthday next year.
When I get there I'll think of it again!
Mom, are you preparing your luxury bag savings properly?
Oh, perfect
It's our wedding anniversary in mid-November, so I'm planning to give it to you then.
You're really cool, you filial daughter, you filial daughter ㅠㅠ
So when can we date?
I'm so depressed
Tell me what's going on
It's been too long since I felt human warmth
Oh, we're not going to Silvertown like this.
In Gangneung, everyone is a couple, so it's unlucky
I heard that you can meet a lot of people through apps these days. What do you think?
What am I lacking...
Why am I single
If I go to Jeju Island, will everyone be a couple?
If you meet through an app, won't you get cheated on?
If we smoke and drink as soon as we meet, won't the long-term be okay?
What a truly novel idea!
Should I set this friend up on a blind date?
No, I hate blind dates because I'm too proud
Let's talk about your ideal type.
I think it would be okay to just be a normal person now...
Do you also write down the cat's height separately?
How do you measure a cat's height?
I was curious too, so I asked.
Don't you know about Kiki Cat's liquid theory?
Do you go to the hospital to get your weight measured?
Yeah, I used to have a scale at home when I was sick, but I sold it after I got better.
What have you purchased recently?
Um, food? Our piglet eats well.
What is the price range?
20,000-30,000 won? Depending on the capacity and ingredients, it varies greatly.
Wow, how often do I have to buy that again?
So how long have you been eating this...
I didn't check it in detail
Are you only buying one of each type?
No, you have to change it often
If I buy something online, how long will it take for it to be delivered?
I ordered it for dawn delivery
Have you ever been camping?
Oh, I think I've done it once or twice
Have you ever lived in a camper van?
I haven't been in a camper van yet
Have you ever tried car camping?
No ㅠㅠ
I want to try
Do you like fishing?
Ugh, no
zero patience
Can you wait until I buy a car?
Will you sleep in the car with me?
I want to buy a car in 20 years
If you're still alive by then, let's sleep together^^
Have you ever gone fishing on a boat?
Oh, you don't get seasick?
I haven't tried it
Aren't you afraid of bugs if you sleep in a tent?
Ugh I hate bugs so much
Have you ever been to a place like Wolmido and played balloon darts?
It seems like it's been a long time since I've been to Wolmido
Do you like going to amusement parks?
I really like it ㅠㅠ
Let's go to the amusement park
Have you ever played a lot of games like those at amusement parks?
What games are there at the amusement park?
I think there were a lot of things like claw machines!
Ah, aren't you good at claw machines?
I don't play claw machine
The weather is nice now, should we go to the amusement park?
Yeah! When are you going?
It would be fun
Where should I go among Everland, Lotte World, and Wolmido?
Wolmido Viking is so thrilling
Haven't you tried it?
Should I go in November?
Yeah! I heard that safety bar is about to break.
It'll come loose once it passes a certain angle. It's fun!
As expected, life comes and goes...
Is there anywhere you want to go for the holiday season?
I love Gangneung so much
I just came back today, but do you still love Gangneung?
Yeah, I'll go live in Gangneung later.
Oh, daebak Silvertown Gangneung?
Kiki, are you going to Gangneung again?
Have you ever been to Kiki's World?
I haven't been to Gyeongju World ㅠㅠ
Do you want to go racing with me?
Come with me
I can go to the amusement park and travel, it's so great.
Oh, I see. Two rabbits.
When I went to Gyeongju, the night view was really pretty.
Oh right, that crown prince and the Wolji? They were pretty there.
Oh yeah, that's right, I went there!
Let's go there too
Do you want to go wearing a hanbok? It'll make you feel like you're traveling abroad.
Oh idea there's a place you'll really like!
Gyeongju? Why?
What do I like?
It's cool after the rain today
Can I order a man to man?
If I order now, will it arrive next week? Call
What should we wear when we go to Jeju Island?
I looked up the weather in Jeju Island and it was 25 degrees on Thursday and Friday and 22 degrees on Saturday!
What's the weather like?
It would be perfect if it didn't rain ㅠㅠ
I don't think it'll rain! Haha
Okay then hehe
Is it raining where you are now?
I just stopped!
The wind is blowing hard
I didn't come when I was in Gangneung, but it's getting better and better ㅠㅠ
Oh my, I shouldn't have come when I arrived in Incheon ㅜㅜ
Yeah ㅠㅠ But hasn't it rained a lot these past few days?
I just kept bringing it to work
you?
What did you take with you?
Ah, an umbrella! Haha, you!
Ahh umbrella kiki
I bought it once at a convenience store and never took it ㅠㅠ
Are you able to order at the kiosk?
Our age is still okay
These days, labor costs are high, so they're all kiosks.
But my parents' generation had a hard time.
Many people say that they have difficulty using the kiosk and end up going home without being able to order.
How must our grandparents feel? ㅠㅠ
So, there are classes at the community center that teach you how to use smartphones and kiosks!
Oh, there's something like that?
The smart era is great, but it's not all that great because it's not available to all ages.
Yeah ㅠㅠ I actually find the kiosk more convenient than ordering in detail.
Yeah, I also like it better when I press the buttons myself rather than talking, because I don't make any mistakes.
It's hard to communicate these days because of the masks ㅠ
When making the final payment at the kiosk, you need to press card payment and insert the card, but many people don't know that ㅜㅜ
Actually, if you do what I tell you to do, it will work ㅠㅠ
Many people say that kiosks do not accept Samsung Pay.
Oh, that might be a little confusing
Pfizer vaccine effectiveness declines after 2 months...
That's right, so I got the second shot and was waiting for the booster shot.
That's right... I heard that some Dutch people gave up on entering beauty pageants because they didn't want to get vaccinated.
Yeah Kiki but vaccines are really a matter of personal freedom so what ㅠㅠ
That's right, the vaccine has come out, but there are still many problems.
I heard recently that a cure for coronavirus will be released soon.
Oh really?
How does that come out?
So, I heard that the number of people waiting for the medicine to come out rather than getting an injection has increased.
If you're going to eat it, it's probably better.
Yeah, yeah... But what's most shocking to me is that the Pfizer CEO hasn't gotten the vaccine yet.
Oh, by the way, Singapore has over 3,000 confirmed cases a day.
We also took a picture of Samcheon once ㅠ
Oh, us too?
Wow, I didn't know
But it has fallen a lot these days
They said there were a thousand people in two days!
I wish it would go down to three digits soon ㅠㅠ
I changed my eyelash perm shop a few days ago!
Oh really?
Was the shop not that good before?
Ah, there was some distance ㅜㅜ
So I switched to the company side!
Ah, how is the new shop?
i love it!
Have you ever tried eyelash extensions?
Anning!
I want to try perming too!
Perm is worth it!
Let's do it once
It lasts for about 6 weeks!
I'm not good at using the cowardly viewer
Then you absolutely need a pump
How much does Kiki cost?
35 thousand won!
What color do you want your nails to be?
Oh right, I didn't think about that.
I did it in white yesterday!
I have warm tones so I was told not to use bright colors.
How about beige or coffee color?
Oh good good
I told you to do a slightly ambiguous color like that
Have you ever tried milk thistle?
Hey, no!
Was that a good thing?
Have you ever tried Omega 3 right away?
No Kiki
I don't even eat fish, so my mom told me to take Omega 3.
Have you ever tried applying albochil to a mouth?
Ah, Albochil is a regular...
Have you ever taken vitamin D?
No way ㅠㅠ
I'll fill it with photosynthesis
How much does Albochil hurt...?
Tears just flowed like a faucet
Have you tried using a medicine that can be used as a gargle instead of an albochil?
Oh no
I received it as a gift, but I haven't used it ㅠ
They say you have to gargle for your dental health. Do you use it?
Oh really?
What are the benefits of gargling?
Hehehe I don't know...
If you don't eat fish, make sure to take omega 3 ㅜㅜ
Mom said she wants to eat pomegranates these days
We always order our pomegranates from Gmarket!
Oh really? How about Gmarket?
It's comfortable!
My mom is a Gmarket VVIP!
Wow, how much Kiki did you order?
Steadily... When I was young, I thought that phone orders could only be made through Gmarket.
Hey Kiki, my mom used to use auctions a lot
Oh, your mother is a fan of auctions!
Is that also convenient?
Like you, I thought that orders could only be placed through auctions...
Ah Kiki, these days you buy a lot from Naver Shopping
My mom also thinks Kiki is changing little by little
I think Naver has become a lot easier to find than before!
Yeah, that's right. The site itself is the most convenient.
And payment is also very convenient...
My mom uses Naver and Coupang the most
Oh, Coupang is convenient too!
Coupang actually asks for my ID and password all the time.
I'm watching Cobik for the first time in a while and Baek A-yeon is in it
Oh, is that person good at singing?
Oh my, it's been a while since the song came out, but it's finally out!
Oh, it's been a long time
I'm watching the live broadcast on TV for the first time in a long time, and wow... you can see all the skin
Kiki Ah, so that's why celebrities don't look good even if they take good care of themselves ㅠㅠ
Oh my gosh, your skin looks so good!
It's better to take good care of it than to take bad care of it
Ahh Kiki, I also watched TV yesterday for the first time in a long time
It's amazing, it's amazing
It's been a while since we both watched TV
A gentleman and a lady that mom watches? We watched the drama together
I saw you doing this while I was changing channels earlier!
It hasn't been that long since you started, right?
Oh, I guess so! Okay, the deal started after the Kwang Sisters finished.
Oh, that's right, that's right
Okay, I heard that Kwang Sisters also had high viewer ratings!
Oh really?
My mom also found it funny
So you saw it too?
I also saw it a few times when I went to my parents' house.
Are there any webtoons you're reading these days?
Among the Sunday webtoons, I enjoy the one called Byeol-isam-shop
Which is better, Naver or Daum?
I mainly use Naver!
Are you talking about the Byeol-i-sam-shop thing that makes caller ID numbers appear?
Oh right, right, it's a bit of a sentimental cartoon from when we were young. The content is Kiki
Oh my gosh...
I want to watch a movie, but is there anything to watch these days?
Have you seen that movie with Hwang Jung-min?
Oh, actor Hwang Jung-min is playing actor Hwang Jung-min?
Oh, that was the hostage, the title
I really wanted to see that, is it still showing?
I don't know ㅠㅠ
I think it's over
After that, there wasn't really any movie I wanted to see ㅜㅜ
Have you been there?
Me too ㅠㅠ
I feel like I'm just watching old movies on Netflix.
Are there any Korean movies on Netflix?
Among recent Korean movies, there's Squid Game...?
Mom, what did you want to eat yesterday?
I told you about pig's feet yesterday
Oh but mom doesn't like it when I order pig's feet ㅜㅜ
It's delicious to have it delivered by courier
Where did Dad buy the Makguksu last time?
I bought it at the market along with pig's feet.
As expected, there are a lot of delicious restaurants in the market.
What's on the market?
I think it was delicious when I ordered Kimchi stew last time!
When did you order Kimchi stew?
Kimchi Pizza Tangsuyuk~ You said it was delicious last time!
I remember it, let's order it again next time
How about the pasta I made!
What my daughter made was delicious
Actually, isn't all food made by others delicious?
Cooking is the hardest part
How long has it been since we moved into our house?
It's already been 6 years since I came to Incheon from Bucheon.
Was the Bucheon house for rent or for sale?
I rented a house in Incheon and then rented a house in Bucheon.
Is the house in Incheon for sale right now?
Yeah, that's a deal
Did you look around at real estate agencies when you first bought a house?
Back then, you had to go to the real estate agent yourself.
Wow, it would have been so hard to go around everything myself ㅜㅜ
I never thought I'd be able to view rooms through an app like this
How many years is the lease contract?
The basic is 2 years, but there are some houses that only do it for 1 year.
Oh, it depends on the situation
Yes, you can extend it
If I leave, I will have to go to a rented house.
Yeah, it'll be better than rent.
What did you ride when you went to your aunt's house?
I went to the terminal and took a bus.
How long does it take from Wonju Terminal to Imo Cafe?
It took about ten minutes by taxi.
If it's a taxi, there's no bus
I heard that taking the bus is inconvenient, so I took a taxi.
It's fortunate that it's close. What did you take to get to Incheon Terminal?
I took the subway from home
Well, it's good because it only takes ten minutes
When I went into my aunt's house, I got in my uncle's car.
Is there no transportation to Yangpyeong House?
There is no subway station or bus around.
Wow, I have to go by car.
Yeah, that's why I went in my uncle's car.
What was your uncle's car?
That SUV must be Santa Fe
Mom, did you say you used up your vacation time this week?
Yeah, I'll use my vacation days and take a break.
Is it an atmosphere where you have to be mindful when using annual leave?
No, I'm free without that
Oh good, when is payday?
I will receive it in 10 days
If the 10th is a holiday, when will you give it to me?
Give it to me before that
Oh great, we do that too!
When will I get my paycheck?
I will receive it on the 30th
There's a lot left to get paid
Right... but it disappears as soon as you receive it anyway...
It was all like that back then
Right? I'm normal, right?
Yeah, mom was like that too
If I join the military, which one would suit me best: the Army, Navy, or Air Force?
My daughter can't swim, so she's excluded from the Navy.
Oh right, I'm scared of water
So, are you confident in things like bungee jumping?
Uh... no... I haven't tried it
The answer is out Army
Oh, wise Kiki, if you get LASIK and go to the military, there's one thing you can't train for.
Is there something like that? What is it?
I heard that they don't do chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear warfare training.
Isn't that the hardest part?
Yeah, that's the feeling of being stabbed with that hook.
This is really tough training
That's why I told you never to touch your face.
Are you hurt?
They say you have to be careful and everyone is having a hard time
I'll be so exhausted after doing that
Mom, when did you file your taxes?
I think it's been about 4 years
Isn't it really difficult?
It was very difficult, but I worked hard.
Did you get it straight from taxation without accounting?
Yeah, I got a level 2 tax accountant license in one go.
Didn't you say you have computer skills too?
It was so long ago that I don't remember it well
So is it 1st class? 2nd class?
It was single rank back then
Wow, there was something like that in computer skills too?
Is that what Word is like now?
Yeah, that's right, I got the word, but it's a single level.
Did you get a lot of English typing questions when you took the Word test?
Yeah, I was really embarrassed
Still, you passed. Good job.
Mom, is your big aunt's cafe doing well?
A person confirmed with coronavirus visited a few weeks ago.
Hey, are your aunt and uncle okay?
Luckily, they were takeout customers and the test results were all negative.
I'm so glad I did. I almost got into trouble.
Fortunately, my aunt's blood pressure hasn't dropped these days.
Ah, is this the aftereffects of a car accident? ㅜㅜ
I think so, I almost died and came back to life
Isn't anyone in our family getting married soon?
My aunt who lives in Namhae is getting married.
I wonder if my whole family can go because of Corona
They say that if you get hit twice, the number of people will be different
I don't fit in so I'll leave it
Let's re-plan depending on the situation.
Okay, let me know when you go to Namhae.
Yeah, if we can see the family, let's go see it.
How long has your aunt been dating before getting married?
We started a business with the intention of getting married, met for 6 months and got married.
Oh, so fast... Auntie, you're super fast...
I guess that's why we're middle school classmates
Oh, you're not a complete stranger.
So I guess it was a little faster
Um, how old is your aunt?
My aunt is in her late 30s now.
Oh, when do you want me to get married?
If you want to be my daughter, do it. It doesn't matter.
Is this my freedom?
What aren't you doing?
I have to have children and get married while I'm alive.
Oh I don't want to get married haha
They say that these days, there are even people who don't do it.
That's right, single-person households are increasing these days.
Daughter, you can do whatever you want.
Did you used to have dogs in the countryside?
Yeah, but now he's gone to a different house
I remember there being a rabbit too
There were a lot of pigs in the yard.
Why did you all go to different houses?
My grandparents said that they had a hard time farming, so they sent them to an acquaintance's house.
Luckily, you sent it to someone you know!
The countryside is all neighbors
That's right, Mom, I've lived there since I was little.
I've always had a lot of animals since I was little
Wow, there was no chicken?
I had a daughter when she was little
Oh, I don't remember that, Buddha
She was too young and my daughter was scared.
Haha that's right I don't approach
So you won't remember
Mom, do you want to try pilates?
I had back surgery. Will I be okay?
People with back pain should definitely exercise.
Is Pilates something we all do together?
There are 1:1 and group classes.
Then it has to be 1 on 1
If I take it as an individual, you will pay more attention to my physical condition.
Is it worth learning from a group?
Yeah, but the intensity is a bit low
Is that because everyone has to adjust the difficulty level?
I think that's why everyone can't do it if you set a standard for them.
You teach exercise for beginners.
Yeah, that's why I do a lot of stretching sometimes.
It's also important to stretch your body
Warm-up exercises are absolutely the most important thing to pay attention to.
If you don't warm up properly, you'll be in big trouble.
When will the penguin ice breaker game I bought come?
The penguin was so cute
Kiki is funny, isn't he? He looks like Pengsoo.
Is it worth doing?
I liked it because it wasn't a game that required a lot of thinking.
Last time you played Lumikub, it was hard, Kiki
That requires a lot of brain power
Yeah Kiki but time goes by so fast and it's fun
Time really flies
It's more fun if you go to a board game cafe
Have you ever been to a cafe with friends?
We often go in groups too
How many hours do you play games when you go?
I've only played Lumicube for over 3 hours
Playing just one game for 3 hours?
I could have played another game, but I was so focused that I came to my senses and 3 hours had passed. Kiki
I guess you concentrated very well.
Where do you want to go on a family trip?
I like places that are not too far away
Ganghwado, this much would be good!
Is there anything fun to do in Ganghwado?
There's a luge and a dinosaur museum too Kiki
Have you been to the dinosaur museum?
I went out to play, but it rained so much that I was looking for an indoor space.
Was there a lot to see?
Yeah I thought it would be childish but it's really amazing
What is Luge doing?
Ah, I think it's a real-life version of Kart Rider.
Are you driving yourself?
But you don't steer with your feet, you drive with the steering wheel!
Not only direction with the handle?
Yeah, you can brake and go straight
What a strange driving method.
How's the weather in Wonju?
It's autumn and the wind blows a lot.
Oh, it's still cold here after the rain yesterday.
I guess it's really fall now
But when I checked the weather, fall was short
They say it's getting shorter and shorter
This time it'll be over in about two weeks...
Fall is that short?
I can come back again but it's going to be super cold next Sunday
I guess the heat has gone away now
Now I have to put on short sleeves
It's the season when short sleeves become pajamas
Yeah, I'll be wearing padding soon
I saw someone wearing a vest padding yesterday
Wow, already? What does he wear in winter...
I guess you feel cold easily
Have you ever wanted to use an Apple phone?
No, Mom, LG phone is more convenient
Isn't the flip phone I bought okay?
Isn't that Samsung?
That's right, Apple said it would make a foldable phone in 2023.
If there are 2 years left, it's still a long way to go
But looking at the sales of the Z Flip 3, it seems like it could be pushed back a bit.
Apple is slower than Galaxy?
5G was also released a year late
Do a lot of your friends use iPhones?
The iPhone is actually a phone that users don't wait for.
Samsung and Apple are completely divided
Yes, but there are some iPhone users who have switched to the Z Flip 3 this time.
Are there a lot of people around you who bought that phone?
Yeah, there are a lot of people who moved from iPhone!
Well, I guess it was a hit
These days, even teenagers get vaccinated.
What country did you start from?
Oh, that Canada is the first!
Did you get any teen approval recently?
Approved for ages 12 to 17 at the end of August
Is the vaccination interval the same as ours?
No, the interval between Pfizer and Moderna is different.
How are Pfizer and Moderna different?
Pfizer takes 3 weeks, Moderna takes 4 weeks.
It's very different from us
And it has to be something like 1st and 2nd
Aren't other countries suitable for teenagers?
The US only gives Pfizer
What is your age range?
12~17 years old! Same
I see. Should the US also have the same 1st and 2nd rounds?
I did nail art!
Did you go to the shop?
I did it myself this time
Did you go to the shop and get it removed last time?
Oh, I did that at home too
What color did you do it with?
This time I did it in white
What color are you going to do next?
Since it's fall, should I try coffee color?
It goes well with fall and coffee color.
But if you do it alone, it takes too much time
Mom, it only takes an hour to do it.
I can't apply it to the other hand after applying it to one hand, so I have to wait and do it again.
Right. How long did it take?
I think it took me two and a half hours...
So I guess everyone is going to the shop...
I'm going to the dentist today
After you return, collect it and file an insurance claim.
I can't not go because I feel like I'm getting better after receiving treatment.
Treatment must be continued
Yes, I should have kept going even after the car accident.
I can't help it since I started working at the company
Yeah, you can get treatment over the weekend~
Did you receive good treatment when you were hospitalized for a week?
It's busier at the hospital
How many treatments did you get?
I get one in the morning and one in the afternoon, and they even do it on weekends!
Can I get it on the weekend too?
Yeah, but once before 1pm!
It's amazing that you can do it even on weekends
I guess it was because it was a hospital specializing in traffic accidents
Because you never know when a traffic accident might happen
You said you were going to buy a phone case, did you buy it?
I haven't found it yet so I haven't bought it yet
Did you look in the places I told you to look?
Where was it? I keep forgetting
Ponpujiyo~ Take a look
So, did you buy a daughter there too?
I bought it from Ideas
Is that a phone case site too?
No, there are many different types, they sell food and daily necessities.
That's fine too. Did you buy that there last time?
What are you talking about?
The envelope that mom and dad gave you your allowance in?
Oh right, that's what I ordered there
If you make something like that yourself, it'll take a long time to ship, right?
Well, if it's short, it takes 2 or 3 days, and if it's long, it can take up to 10 days.
It's almost like overseas shipping
Did you see something funny on TV with your aunt?
Aunt, you don't watch TV much, what about your daughter?
I watched New Journey to the West Great Escape without any reason
Now that I look at it, I guess you like Kang Ho-dong
So I thought I always liked Yoo Jae-seok
Kang Ho-dong appears in every entertainment show I watch
Yes, I watched the original broadcast of Knowing Brothers after a long time.
Kang Ho-dong appears there too
Come to think of it, I guess I'm a huge fan...
Haven't you seen the drama?
I watched the original episode of Gaetmaeul Chachacha
Who's out there?
Actors Shin Min-a, Kim Seon-ho, etc. will appear.
Mom, actress Shin Min-a is so pretty
Me too... the dimples and the face and everything are just pretty
In the past, the role of a gumiho suited me well.
I think Yuna made a movie. Do you know the title?
Miracle I saw it yesterday while flipping through the channels
Oh, actor Park Jung-min is also there.
Who is that actor?
The actor who appeared in the movie Deliver Us from Evil!
What role did you play there?
The person who came out dressed as a woman!
Oh, I see. I saw that movie.
Was it fun?
Did you see it at home?
Yeah the action was fun
I saw it at the cinema and it was really fun.
Is it because everyone is an acting fan?
I think so. I think the baby that came out there is so cute.
What was that friend's name? She was pretty.
Park So-yi! I also followed you on Instagram
I became a fan, it was so pretty
Which type of ramen do you like the best?
Shin Ramyun is the best
How about thick noodles like raccoon dogs?
Thinner is better
Do you like snack noodles better?
By the way, what kind of ramen does your daughter like?
I like it if it's a gap
Is that spicy ramen?
Correct! I like spicy food.
Do you eat spicy food well?
yes
Is your mom eating well?
I used to eat it, but I don't eat it these days.
So you don't like chicken feet?
I like to eat things that aren't spicy
My mom makes it herself because I like it not spicy.
When mom makes it, she doesn't make it spicy
When will the subscription be available?
That's probably because it's an age that doesn't include the period of not owning a house yet.
What age is that standard?
The period of being homeless is recognized from the age of 30
Oh, so I don't have to put it in until then?
You have to keep putting it in
Is there no other way?
If you get married, you can receive special supply for newlyweds
Oh, that special supply is something you can win once in your life?
Yeah, that's it
And if you get married, you will be recognized as a non-homeowner even if you are under 30 years old.
Marriage... uh... um... I'm almost 30
There are a lot of rental houses these days.
Oh, what about that lease?
It's okay to think of it as a long-term lease
That would be hard to do too...
That's right, it's really hard to find a house.
Isn't it inconvenient to change trains?
I think the subway is better than the bus.
Why doesn't the bus run often?
It was so hard to get off because it was shaking so much.
Oh right
There's a saying that if you stop, you get up, but it's all a lie...
I stopped but it wasn't in front of the door so I started right away
Thinking about that made me sick
Are there a lot of people on the subway when you go to work?
There are a lot of people going to and coming from work...
Incheon Line 1, Line 1, or Line 2, which line is the most crowded?
Line 2 for work, line 1 for home!
Where do I get on Line 2 when I go to work?
I'm getting on at Sindorim, and there's a train departing from Sindorim!
Is the empty car leaving from Sindorim?
Yeah, yeah
There are a lot of people there too...
Line 2 is the epitome of hellish train
Mom, does your company have vacation?
How many days of summer vacation do you have?
Oh good
Got a bad reputation?
yes
Did your daughter have a vacation too?
I had 5 days of vacation from work before, so I was able to take a total of 9 days off, including the weekend.
Aren't you going to get a discount on your annual leave?
Yeah, I had a separate vacation.
Were you able to use your annual leave freely?
No, it wasn't free ㅜㅜ
So how did you use it?
I should have reported this a month ago...
Was raw tea also available?
Yeah, at first I used it as raw tea, but later I changed it to monthly tea.
Then there was no half-day off?
I've never used a half-day vacation in my life
I should try it out at work now
Do you know my friend in the Hongcheon Army Unit?
You know, what's wrong with that guy?
Please tell your mom that I am grateful for always sending you kimchi.
If you're alone in the unit, you need to take better care of yourself.
I'm really depressed these days because I can't even go on vacation.
Okay, I guess so
When can you come out?
Maybe Seoul is at level 4 so it won't come out anymore...
Did you come out often before?
I come out every week and ask if I'm a soldier.
It's going to be harder for me to not be able to come out often
Yeah, it's harder for me because I like both alcohol and friends.
Have you been to that guy's unit?
I was suddenly told to return to the unit before, but there was no bus, so I drove him there.
Are there things that suddenly ask you to come back?
It's not common, but it happens sometimes
It must have been really urgent
Mom, what subjects did you like when you were a student?
If I had to choose, I liked Korean history
Wow, you're completely different from me
What subjects did your daughter like?
I only did math
But why did you go to liberal arts?
I didn't think I could survive in science if I only liked math...
Why did you like math?
I really like it when the answer comes out as soon as you solve the problem
Yes, because math has a definite answer.
Yeah, that was so good
What subject did you hate?
History! Too hard
If you weren't interested, it could be even worse
That's right, it's too hard to start
I'll prepare for the Korean history qualification later.
When did you take a family photo with your grandparents?
We all took this picture together when we were in high school.
Wow, it's been over 30 years
Yeah, now that you mention it, it's been a while
Yeah, we never took a picture
I guess I should take a picture of that sometime
What should I wear to take a picture?
Wouldn't a white T-shirt be the best?
How about a hanbok? Hanbok Kiki
You wouldn't know it's from the 90s
Kiki, that's right, that's the concept, Merong
Let's pretend it's a first birthday party with only my daughter wearing hanbok
Stone...? I'll just dress the stone in a hanbok.
I need to make a reservation, but when should I take the picture?
Should I take a picture for my mom and dad's wedding anniversary in November?
It's meaningful, I like it
Where should I have my wedding?
I need to talk to my daughter and decide who she wants to marry.
Does it matter where I do it?
It's my daughter's wedding, so do whatever you want.
All okay
But I don't want to do it from far away
There are a lot of things to prepare on the wedding day, so it might be difficult if it's far away.
Oh, do you still remember?
I had lunch on a weekday and I still remember it
Why did you do it on a weekday?
My grandmother decided on the location and my grandfather decided on the date.
It's so amazing
Are there people coming on weekdays...?
That's because my grandmother prepared all the food for the wedding herself.
Wow, awesome
Oh, grandma, you used to do that!
So, my grandfather was worried that if he did it on the weekend, it would be hard for my grandmother and that it would only result in a lot of food waste.
Oh sweet grandpa!
Don't worry about grandma!
So I did it on a weekday
Have you ever seen someone raise an iguana?
It's a strange animal
Have you seen your daughter?
My friend raised it when he was little!
You don't raise iguanas these days?
Yeah, I'm raising a cat now!
Do you want to raise an animal?
No, I can't even raise myself
My daughter never said anything about having an animal, even when she was little.
Was it hard for me to raise myself since I was little...
I raised the chicks sold in front of the school for a while.
Oh, I think I remember
How much did you raise it?
It was an unhealthy chick and died quickly.
Oh, so that's why your memory isn't clear
Yes, I haven't said I wanted to raise an animal since then.
Is it because I sent you away so quickly?
That could be it
Mom, do you like hiking?
No, I just like looking at mountains
Did you see the women's volleyball game this time?
I saw it
Has your daughter ever played volleyball?
Yes, I was in the volleyball club in elementary school.
How did you get into the volleyball club?
At that time, the teacher told me that if I grew taller, I should join the volleyball club.
Do you remember volleyball?
I still remember the details!
Was that volleyball game fun?
There was something about that volleyball that I liked.
Oh, is the volleyball soft?
Yeah yeah but if you get hit by that ball it really hurts
The ball must have come that hard
Yeah, no kidding
It hurts even to catch that ball
I have to work hard just to look at it
Do you know Maple Story?
Did your daughter do this a lot when she was in elementary school?
That's correct~
Did you see what I did?
I only saw very small characters moving.
Oh, right
Kiki is cute
How many minutes per game is that?
There's no such thing as one game, just keep going
So you're going to keep playing the game?
Yeah I can just turn it off when I want to
So it's been a really long time
That's right, the advantage became a disadvantage.
Is it an advantage to be able to turn it on at will?
If something happens while you're playing another game and you turn it off, you'll get in trouble
To those who play games together?
That's also the case, if you go out often and get reported, there are places where you'll get banned.
It's being managed very thoroughly.
I'm going to Jeju Island tomorrow
What time is your flight leaving?
After work, I'm catching a flight at 8:30
How many minutes before check-in for domestic flights does it close?
Until 30 minutes ago!
You must go by 8 o'clock
Do you have time after work?
Yeah, yeah, I have to go through hell and back and forth.
When are you coming back?
Saturday at 20:50 Bangi Tagoo King
This time, both the coming and the going are night flights!
Yeah, I was tempted to fly at night.
Are there any differences in night flights?
I like looking at the night view from the window
The night view must be really pretty
That's right, you should go and rest quickly.
Take care and have fun
Now I don't have to turn on the fan when I sleep.
It's cold when I sleep now
Yes, even the knit vest came out today
Isn't it hot on the subway?
When I go to work, all the trains are air-conditioned
Aren't you cool when you get off work?
When you leave work, give up everything and go home.
It's always summer
The subway is strangely summer all year round
So summer is summer, winter is summer
I guess it's because there are a lot of people and it's humid
I have this thought every time I commute to work and it's hot and crowded
What do you think?
Are you thinking about quitting your job?
Hey, are you strong?
I'm thinking... should I buy a car?
Isn't the car stuck?
Even though it's blocked, I don't have to enjoy the summer with people.
I should dress according to the train, not the weather.
Now you can get vaccinated without a reservation
Since when did it change like that?
I think it starts on October 11th!
Then should I just go to the hospital and say that it's okay?
No, I have to go to the hospital and check for remaining vaccines.
Can I just check by phone and then visit the hospital?
That's correct~
I guess I'll start getting hit soon too
I heard the cycle is getting shorter now
That's right, it was originally 4 weeks, but it was reduced to 6 weeks due to a shortage of vaccines.
I guess it's okay now
But the period is too long
Self-quarantine for 2 weeks, and even after getting vaccinated, 2 weeks later ㅜㅜ
Why is it 2 weeks? It's long.
They also recommend booster shots from the same day.
What do you use for booster shots?
You probably know it as Pfizer
My mom's first and second shots were both Pfizer.
Now that I've been vaccinated, I guess I can go abroad
They said it would be somewhere from November, but where is it?
Probably Thailand!
I think it was Thailand!
You saw the news, daughter!
It was Thailand
Do you know what the squid game is?
Isn't this a famous drama these days?
That's right
Did you see that?
I haven't seen it
Why is that?
You can see that in China too
Yeah, but why?
I guess they made goods because it was so famous
It seems to be popular
But they are selling counterfeit products in China
Are there counterfeit goods too?
Then how different is the feeling?
I didn't know
I just found out
Have you ever tried putting on eyelashes?
I used to wear it a lot when I was young
Did your mom have eyelash extensions too?
How many times have you tried it later?
Did that make your eyelashes look okay?
I was losing everything so I stopped
Are you taking one pack a day these days?
It wasn't as easy as I thought
Yeah, I tried it for 3 days too, but it was hard
It was a three-day resolution
Skin care is difficult
Is Sulwhasoo lotion good for you?
Sulwhasoo is the best
If you start using expensive cosmetics, your skin will adapt to them.
Isn't Mom old enough to adapt?
Um... right...
So I just write whatever~^^
Are you drawing the big picture?
Are you going to get a health checkup this year?
The end of the year is already approaching
Don't change the subject~
You should check it~
Did you decide to get a thorough checkup with your daughter this time?
Is that daughter me?
The mother has one daughter
Oh, it's a complete mess...
Uh... I'll go too
Let's get tested together instead of going as a guardian
Mom, you should get an endoscopy too!
My daughter can have an endoscopy too
Mom, is this your first time?
Yeah, this is my first endoscopy.
Then I'll do it for the first time in my 50s too
You only want to learn bad things
Ebebe Merong, let's get a health checkup before December
Okay then let's go
Where did you order soy milk this time?
I originally tried to order from Gmarket, but they contacted me saying that delivery would be delayed.
Is it because it's a holiday?
Did you order it again?
I ordered it again from Timon
It was somehow super fast
I didn't know Timon had fast shipping either
I just found out now
These days, they even deliver clothes on the same day.
Brandy! But my friend trusted me and ordered it and it never came Kiki
Where do you want to live?
Live far away?
Bucheon... Alive Kiki
early
Then I guess it was crowded because it was a holiday
Is that so ㅜㅜ
So I always order clothes that are loose
In the case of overseas shipping, please order earlier
Overseas shipping really comes when you forget
Is there a website where I can order clothes overseas?
I watched TV for the first time in a long time and it was fun.
What did you see yesterday?
I saw the new Racket Boys
What kind of entertainment is that?
Celebrities are playing badminton!
Oh, I see. It's a sports show.
Yeah, that's right. I find sports entertainment fun.
Maybe it's because I like watching
Yeah, so I looked up badminton players yesterday and looked to see if there were any lessons around my house. Kiki
Who are the celebrities?
Yoon Doojoon is here! Highlight!
Isn't Yoon Doojoon from Beast?
Due to issues with their agency, the same members left and started their own company, which became Highlight!
How many members are there now?
Maybe... only 4 left
I'll see you again next time
Who is your favorite movie star?
I like actress Jeon Ji-hyun
Mom is so consistent
Jeon Ji-hyun was pretty even when she was young
The drama is starting soon, but you've also done a lot of movies
Have you been to your daughter's comic book cafe?
I've never been there!
Don't you read comics often?
Yeah, I don't like books.
I have friends who like comic books.
So these days, everyone reads webtoons.
Have you ever read a webtoon?
No I don't have that either Kiki
Don't your friends recommend it?
I recommended college life or something
I really have never seen it before
Mom, do you like rice noodles?
Yeah, I eat rice noodles often.
Oh, do you like coriander?
It was difficult at first, but now it's delicious
Do you like cheesy food?
It's delicious when you add more cheese to it
So do you like tteokbokki?
Tteokbokki is so spicy it's hard
You don't like spicy food anymore?
I won't eat it anymore
So, do you like egg dishes?
Steamed eggs, scrambled eggs, and baked eggs are all good.
What food do you dislike?
I don't eat fish very often
Oh, you don't like raw fish either?
I don't eat raw fish at all
Mom, do you have a savings account?
No, do you have a daughter?
I think success in life is about sharing
It is better to manage your money with real estate than anything else.
Which area would be better for distribution?
The place where my daughter is most active is also good
They say that rental housing is also okay.
It would be good if the conditions and period were right.
There's a youth requirement, but wouldn't that fit me?
Yes, it is different for each distribution site, so check carefully.
Where should I go between Gyeonggi, Incheon, and Seoul?
Since my home is in Incheon, try looking for Gyeonggi and Seoul.
I guess I'll have to go to Bucheon, Gyeonggi.
Friends, are you in Bucheon?
Correct answer. In fact, Bucheon is convenient.
There's also an app. Take a look.
It's been a while since I've driven so I feel awkward
What did you drive?
This time I drove a Kona
Is that an electric car?
I have an electric car, but I used gasoline.
Daughter, have you ever driven an electric car?
No, I never had it so I used gasoline
I haven't even tried charging it yet
Correct! I don't think it will be easy because I haven't tried charging it.
The instructions are all written down, so give it a try.
I guess so. Electric cars are really quiet.
They say that's dangerous
So now it's made to make some noise.
I'll need it, not a lot, but I'll need to hear it so I can tell
Yeah, it seems dangerous
Be sure to drive next time
How long does it take to get to work?
It takes about 15 minutes by subway.
Close is best! Right?
How long will it take for your daughter?
I'm a little over an hour and a half away
Is work going well?
Yeah, are you okay, Mom?
At first, I studied Excel again because it had been so long since I had used it.
Oh, are you feeling better now?
I remember it because I studied it again
Is there a meeting or something?
Once a week
When you have a meeting, do you usually get everyone together and do it?
We don't all get together these days
So are we going to have separate meetings?
Let's split up and have a meeting
How was the snail cream my friend sent me from PX?
It was moist, please do it again next time
Do you remember what it was like to go to training when you were young?
Was that military experience training?
It was Marine Corps experience training!
When and how old were you when you went there?
I went there when I was in elementary school
Is that something you learned at school?
I went to the Taekwondo demonstration team
Was that fun? How was it?
Since I came back, every time I see a red hat, I think of the Marines.
I guess I'm afraid of the Marines.
Even though it was an experience, I still remember how difficult it was...
Do you have any desire to go back again?
Yeah, not even 1 at all
It's a pity, I was going to recommend you go again
I filled out one line of my resume this time.
So what did you fill it with?
I'm writing this on my 3rd grade shorthand resume
Congratulations, really
Didn't you write one last time?
That's because I took CPR training and got a certificate.
Where did you get that kind of education?
Since it was hosted by the Korean Red Cross, I applied at the Red Cross in front of my house and received training.
How much do you pay for education?
Was it 40,000 won or 50,000 won?
It's not free!
How many people take that class?
It's a reservation system, but I was one of about 15 people.
How many hours is the training?
I think it took 5 hours
Can you keep that?
no
I have to retrain every two years!
I'll have to listen again in two years
My aunt sent me a package yesterday. What is it?
My aunt sent me a duck
Oh wow, this looks delicious
Did you see the package that grandma sent you?
Wow, what did grandma send you?
They sent me different types of kimchi
Oh... Grandma, did you get all your vaccines?
It's been two weeks since my paternal grandfather, paternal grandmother, and maternal grandfather all passed away.
Thank goodness there were no side effects?
My grandmother was there for a while, but now everything is fine.
Thank goodness your youngest aunt got both shots?
Yeah, that's right, it's been two weeks
Mom and Dad, is next week the second week?
Yeah, it's almost the second week
It's going to get stronger now
That's right, thank goodness
Is the Namhae wedding just around the corner?
Namhae Aunt Da-da ...
Because of the wedding crowd limit, we can't all go together?
Dad will go as a representative
What time is your aunt's wedding?
It's Saturday at 1pm
It's just lunch time food
So Dad will probably go the day before
The wedding lasts about an hour?
That's right. I heard that these days, people wear masks when taking wedding photos.
It breaks my heart to hear that the mask remains with the photo that will last a lifetime.
The groom sang the congratulatory song
Wow, that's awesome. What should I sing?
Let me ask Dad when he gets home
Who will look after society?
The groom's friend came to see me
Is your aunt in Namhae still raising a puppy?
I used to grow it in the yard, now I grow it inside the house.
What was the dog's name?
They said he was named Sundung because he was innocent.
I remember it being so cute and small
The first time we met was when he was a baby.
Wow, it's been a while now
You have two puppies
Oh my, other than Sundungi, what's that guy's name?
They say that guy is the youngest
Ah Kiki, isn't she so cute? Kiki
The way you name it is so cute too
Mom, if you get a puppy, what do you want to name it?
Then let's say it's a hundred billion
Oh, when you call a puppy, it says, &quot;Come here a hundred billion times&quot;
Yeah, that's what I was aiming for
I have a new sport I want to learn
What kind of exercise is it this time?
Tennis! I'm looking into it.
Have you ever played tennis?
I learned it in college!
Did you have fun learning it?
I have such fun memories
Do you have a tennis racket at home?
When I graduated from college, I gave it to my juniors and they wouldn't be home haha
Then I guess I should buy one
I looked it up and it says if you sign up for 3 months they give you a tennis racket!
I guess I can register for 3 months~
Yeah, that's why I'm going to register!
Do all the other tennis courts provide tennis rackets?
No, there's an open event there!
Then I have to go there even more
Have you played with air a lot?
I did it more when I was a mom
Have you ever played Minesweeper on your computer?
Isn't it secretly nice to spend time there?
Have you heard of Nexon?
Wow, it's a company, right?
Oh my, that's right, that's right, how did you know?
You know a lot about Nexon, why do you have a daughter?
There is a Nexon Computer Museum in Jeju Island.
What kind of place is that?
You can try out games and see unreleased game characters.
Are you playing Nexon's games?
Yeah, you can try all the old ones too
What did you buy there?
I didn't buy it, but I received a postcard and a fan.
There are so many gifts
I went to Jeju Island and it was great
So how many nights did you stay there?
Haha I went for 3 nights and 4 days
Did it feel short? Did it feel long?
It was so fast, it felt like just one night
Did everything go as planned?
No, it rained so I changed everything again
Is it okay to change your lifestyle?
Yes, I moved quickly to fit the time.
Did you find your way with Navi?
Yeah, it was comfortable because there weren't many cars.
Is there a place you would like to recommend in Jeju Island?
I went to Hyue-ri in a hurry and it was really great.
What kind of place is it?
I went to the pink muhly field and there were a lot of flowers.
It would be nice to go on a family trip
Wow, it suddenly got this cold?
So autumn is gone
Right... what should I wear when fall is gone?
It seems like the weather is gone for wearing a coat.
So now I guess I'll have to get out the hot water mat...
It was hot but suddenly got cold
I need to dress well when I go to work now.
But it's hot on the train and cold outside
Yeah, that's the hardest part
Put the fan in and take out the electric blanket.
How cold will it be this winter?
It gets colder as time goes by
This year, the Earth will be less sick and less cold, right?
Well then, let's look forward to it
First, let's take out our winter clothes.
Now let's put on short sleeves
There are a lot of hospitals in Gangnam! Have you heard about the dermatology department among them?
Why Gangnam Dermatology?
Places like dermatology often require payment in advance.
Yes, if you pay in advance, you can get it cheaper.
But I got a text saying that they are closing down due to Corona and opening a second branch next door.
Hey, when did you say it was going to open?
I think they originally sent a text saying they would open soon
If the article came out, it hasn't opened yet?
It hasn't been open for a month
What about the prepaid guests?
So now they're suing
How much did you prepay for each person?
Transactions with damages of up to 3 million won per person
So, there have been many incidents like this in dental clinics and dermatology clinics in the past.
Oh, dental care too? Is there a prepayment for dental care?
For things like corrections, you can also pay in a lump sum
Dubai has now greatly relaxed its entry restrictions for foreigners!
They relieved it faster than us
So, many foreigners are coming and the economy is recovering.
That's really fortunate
Have you heard that Dubai used a really novel method to stop the coronavirus last year?
Was there any way?
They even flew drones to prevent residents from moving around.
Were you checking with a drone?
That's why they lowered the number of confirmed cases per day to 100.
The vaccination rate must be high, right?
That's right, they said 92%!
The vaccination rate is also very high
The fines for not wearing a mask are really high!
How high is it? How much is it?
The fine is about 1 million won in our currency.
Yeah, it's really strong
Are IOPE's base cosmetics any good?
I saw something I bought at a duty free shop, and it was collagen.
Are collagen products any good?
At what age do you need collagen?
Is there an area you would like plastic surgery on?
My eyes seem to be drooping these days
It's going to get dry now, so shouldn't I spray some moisturizing mist on it?
So I ordered a mist
Are you taking good care of your skin when you sleep these days?
I'm also using moisturizing cream and packs well
Are you applying sunscreen properly?
I'm using Hera Sange well
Isn't that sticky and stuff?
I like it because it's waterproof and doesn't erase.
Oh, I want to try it too
Okay, I'll buy you the same thing.
Are you feeling okay after getting vaccinated?
I was so tired for several weeks after the first dose.
So were you okay after the second time?
I have chest pain after the second shot
Then I should go to the hospital right away.
Are you receiving proper acupuncture treatment?
Yeah, yeah, go and get treatment at least once a week or once every two weeks.
Where do you go to get treatment?
I have my fingers and wrists
Will it feel better if I receive it?
It definitely makes me feel more comfortable
Is your turtle neck feeling better?
No, I'm uncomfortable every day Kiki
They say posture is the most important thing
I try to walk with my back straight as much as possible ㅜㅜ
Pay a little more attention
Where did you order food yesterday?
I ordered it in a hurry from Market Kurly
They'll be there soon too
That's exactly what I needed, it was perfect
I went on a trip and my friend didn't bring his pajamas. Kiki
So what did you do?
I tried to order from Coupang, but Kiki
Did you check if you're arriving at Jeju Island?
Yeah, but when I think about it, it's hard to receive it at the dorm ㅜㅜ
Did you also order fruit from Coupang?
The condition was better than I thought
Now they're really selling everything
Have you ever bought anything from the app Idea City?
What app was that?
Since it is a place where writers sell, there are a lot of products.
Then I'll have to check it out
Do you know who CNBLUE is?
Aren't they the group that used to call themselves Loners?
Right, right, you know?

It's been a long time since I've been on the show right now
Long time no see. Are you finished with your military service?

Have you ever thought, &quot;My side is always blocked, but their side isn't blocked?&quot;
Yeah, that's right
There are times like that
The car that moves the center line moves to the side.
But there's one problem with that
Oh, what's the problem?

Yeah! I did it 2 weeks ago haha

It stung when they injected the anesthetic, but it was bearable.

Wow, awesome
That's kind of nice, Kiki
It looks like it's being managed very well
I received the Rosen Express, but there was a problem.
Are your clothes damaged?
Or why?
My house has a front door on the first floor that doesn't have a password, but people keep putting packages in the mailbox...
Oh my god...
Even if there is CCTV, what if someone takes it?
I told you twice, but you put it there again the day before yesterday. The package was so big that more than half of it was sticking out...
It's a jackpot
Is that Rosen's fault?
I asked the first and second questions and they said they would leave it in front of the door, but this time it was the same, so I left an inquiry.
I was so disappointed because it was Rosen's company.
I guess the fortress isn't well managed these days ㅠ
He said he would make sure not to do that next time, so I have to believe him... haha
If you do that again, call me right away.

I think the drawing style and content are important
Is this the style you go for?

What are the prices around there?
In Seoul, it seems like monthly rent and jeonse are no joke...

If it works, I can borrow money with it and pay it back.
that's right
I think it would be great if it could happen

Do you have any married friends?
None of my friends!
Wow, there's not a single one?
Yeah, I think one of us will go next year!
Wow, my friend, there are quite a few people who go there though
Is that because it's a girls' high school?
Oh, that could be true. I'm an engineering major and there weren't many girls ㅜㅜ

Ask me first if anyone wants to go
Oh, sorry

Rice cake!
Giyeopjing Bapuri
Kiki, I think you're really a white dog
Isn't that puppy scary?
Uh... When I go in, I'm probably going to go in at the very back.
Kiki, are you afraid of animals even if you've seen them a few times?
Whoa, it's almost impossible to be in the same space for more than a few years...
Oh, then I guess I'll have to send my friend's dog to its original home.
I'm going to Bappuri's house to play, so I'm going to pretend to be a little nervous!

Yeah! Teach me a little haha
Do you believe me?

I haven't packed my clothes for tomorrow yet!
The weather seems to be clearing up a bit, but it'll still be cold in the morning, right?
that's right
It's cold in the mornings and evenings ㅜㅜ
I bet you're having a lot of trouble deciding what to wear because of the weather ㅜ
that's right
It's too hot on the subway
Still, you should always wear warm clothes!
I heard that it's still hard to get a job these days.
Oh... But honestly, I think young people are not getting jobs.

Have you been vaccinated?
I didn't even get the first one!
you?
It's been 14 days since I completed my vaccination!

I don't think I'll get it yet!
That's right
I heard that there are a lot of complaints from unvaccinated people due to the coronavirus outbreak.
Now you can get it without a reservation!
that's right
It seems like society is somewhat forcing us to do something that isn't forced...
right?
that's right
There was something like that...
I wish the coronavirus would disappear soon so I can live comfortably ㅜ
that's right...
Oh, I'm waiting for the day when I can play comfortably.
Gureung
Always take care of yourself!
Have you seen the squid game?
no
I haven't seen it yet, but it seems to be a worldwide issue...
Have you seen it?
I haven't seen it either
It was quite an issue
I actually watched episode 1 but it wasn't funny so I didn't watch any more...
Why is this an issue...?
So it's a fresh genre...
If Gong Yoo gave you his business card, would you join?
Wow I guess I'll just pretend not to know and go home
you?
Kiki I'm curious, but I don't think I'll call.
Right Kiki
Now even cross-vaccinated people can go to the US
Oh really?
They said only Pfizer would do, but I guess they changed their words
that's right
Now crossover is possible!
I heard that you're traveling abroad these days. Is there a place you'd like to go?
Ugh... I'm scared until it's completely quiet
That's trueㅜ
If you go and get corona for no reason, it will be a national nuisance...
As soon as possible
It's more scary because it's a foreign country
Let's go abroad sometime later when we're fully recovered!
Do you dye your hair often?
Well, I used to do it a lot when I was in college, but I don't do it anymore haha
you?
I used to change colors all the time, but I don't do that these days!
Kiki, how do you take care of your skin?
Haha I use moisturizing cream!
Wow... That one thing can be managed...
You have such strong skin, don't you?
What do you manage with?
When I have trouble, apply some medicine!
Oh my gosh
Where can I buy that medicine?
Olive Young sells something that works well for cystic acne haha
I'll let you know when we meet up later!
Be sure to let me know!
I should go too
Gureung
But you didn't have any troubles when you were a student?
Mom and Dad didn't have any trouble either, so it wasn't a big deal!
Only sometimes!
Wow... As expected, your genes are special...
I'm jealous ㅜ
Instead, my hair is too thin due to my genes...
Kikki, it seems like it's hard to catch two rabbits
When are you going to have a health checkup?
I've got it booked for next week.
Is cervical cancer a target this year?
Yeah, I'm going to do that too
Are you taking vitamins regularly?
I really take care of myself
you?
I still have the one I bought in February
Oh my... We're at an age where we need to take care of ourselves now.
Oh... I'll definitely try it
I'll give you an alarm
Eat with me when I eat
How many insurances do you have?
I have about 5
you?
I have 3
What is the cheapest insurance premium among them?
It's 10,200 won!
Is it really cheap?
It's so cheap
It's Sun Insurance
Let me know too
These days, it's easy to buy things on Instagram too.
okay?
What did you buy?
My cousin had some clothes she liked, so I gave them to her as a gift.
Are sizes and such also available?
Instead, I have to ask about the price and such to find out ㅜㅜ
It's not listed and I have to ask
Yeah, that's a bit uncomfortable
Hey... what did you buy?
I bought a buzz case before
Did you succeed in one go without fail?
no...
It was worse than I thought, so it broke my heart
Wow, awesome
So you returned it?
no
Since it's a product you made yourself, I can't just return it...
Looks like you have some pretty trash in your house.
So now I'm going to look at it more carefully when I buy it.
Goorae
Check the size carefully
I'm watching New Journey to the West 7 now!
Have you seen this?
I really enjoyed watching 7 and 8
Oh, I'm here
I watched them all from 1 to 8!
How often do you see Kiki?
As soon as I opened my eyes, I put on New Journey to the West on my phone
Is there a channel that keeps doing this?
There's a regular channel on Tving!
Anything else for the regular run?
A lot
There was also a great escape!
Have you watched all the seasons of The Great Escape?
Yeah, yeah, I watched everything from 1 to 4 without missing anything.
What was the most fun season?
I enjoyed 3 the most
How long has it been since we had a time machine?
It started in 3 and came out in 4 too!
I made that for real
Have you seen the college diary webtoon?
no
Have you seen it all?
no...
I don't read webtoons...
But how did you know about my college diary?
I bought it because the emoticon was cute, but it turned out to be a webtoon. Kiki
Did you buy a lot of emoticons?
Oh Ji Ji
There are 90
Wow... how many of them are college diaries?
I think there are 4
Doesn't that have everything?
I bought it every time I saw it
What emoticons did you buy recently?
I bought Yumi Carrot's cells
Do you know Luffy?
Luffy was cute too
What cartoon is that?
Merong, only I know
Have you ever eaten mackerel?
yes
I can't eat it at home
Oh, does that smell a lot?
yes
If you eat it at home, it will last a long time
I'd rather have raw fish!
You must have eaten raw fish salad often in Namhae.
that's right
My grandmother made it in a really big container
My dad went to buy mackerel yesterday, but they were all sold out, so he went to 10 places.
Wow, it's really popular
Is that it?
They said they sold out in the morning
Well, Dad left late in the afternoon.
That's why you said it didn't exist
I ate it at Daehado or Soraepogu
Did you go to the salt-grilled restaurant and eat it?
That's right
So my friends jumped out and jumped out
I'm glad you enjoyed it
How long ago did we buy the sofa for our house?
It's been a long time
Everything needs to be changed
If construction starts, do you want to open a veranda?
They say that the house is getting bigger, but it can also get cold.
that's right
I think I saw that too
It might be a good idea to move
If you move, which area do you want to go to?
I like living in Incheon
Is it not a good idea to go back to your hometown?
I'm used to living in an apartment now
They say that once you get used to living in an apartment, it becomes difficult to live in a house.
If you clean grandma's house, the day will be over.
that's right
I also like apartments that are managed well
Where do you want to go?
I want to live in Bucheon
Aren't Bucheon and Incheon not that far apart?
Did you hear that your cousin bought a car?
What car did you buy?
I heard you bought a Mojave
What company makes a car called Mojave?
Hunger!
This is a Kia with a new mark.
Is the Mojave a small or a big car?
What a big, fancy looking car!
Why did you choose that car, sister?
I heard that a car accident would absolutely not work in a compact car.
Is the Mojave a tough car?
It's big, strong, and looks like it won't hold up
Is it exactly the same as your uncle's company car?
That's a bigger carnival
Then uncle, you can't drive a 2-car car?
2 types are possible for up to 10 people
Your daughter can drive too?
Mom, how is your work life?
It's okay because the people I work with aren't too different in age and there's no trouble.
Oh, do you meet them privately too?
I decided to go to a perfume shop this Saturday.
Oh, you seem really close
It's my first time here, but everyone seems to be getting along well.
That's fortunate
Do you often have company dinners?
Everyone had a family, so they went to prepare dinner.
But I guess it wasn't a forced company dinner atmosphere!
The atmosphere is free
are you okay
How long does your daughter's contract last?
I got an extension until the end of December!
Are you a contract worker at your company now?
Yeah, my first contract job ever.
Both contract and full-time jobs have pros and cons, right?
I tried both and they both have pros and cons!
It's all experience haha
If you think like that and work hard, it will work out.
From what I've seen on DP, military life seems really great.
There are some friends who feel very sad when they send their sons away.
Oh, I see
My friends are at an age where they go and come back, but my mother's friends are the ones who send them away.
So my son said that when he comes back from vacation, his legs are about to break.
I'm sorry that you can't come out these days. It must be even more heartbreaking. ㅜㅜ
I also brag about my son who talks on the phone often.
Oh, that son is amazing
It's not easy to talk to your parents regularly.
The farther away you are, the more you miss it
So that's why you keep telling me to join the military?
Because protecting the country is cool
Now I can't even protect myself Kiki Merong
If I enlist now and get discharged, won't my daughter be in her 30s?
Uh... I guess so...
Will you accept me?
Now let's watch the military on TV
That's right
Now it's time to be quiet
Let's see DP one more time
Mom, how many government-funded academies did you attend?
I've been to more than 8
Wow, but what do you still want to learn?
I'm looking for an academy to go to after work
How many daughters do you have?
I have 4 less than my mom
When is the shorthand test next year?
Originally, once in April and once in September!
Only twice a year?
Yeah, that's amazing
I have to risk my life
Have you ever taken a secretary exam?
That has changed to permanent from this year, so it will probably be every week during the period.
I feel like I can breathe easier.
How many times have you had it until last year?
Number 4...?
Actually, I don't remember because I watched it in a hurry the first time haha
You can always prepare it whenever you want.
When are we going to grandma's house?
I might be able to go next year for the Lunar New Year
It's been a really long time since I've seen grandma and grandpa.
I couldn't go because of the corona virus
The metropolitan area is so bad that I'm afraid we'll cause unnecessary damage ㅜㅜ
My great-aunt from Namhae also called
Oh, what did you say?
He asked me who was coming to this wedding.
Oh, you told me to come with a car.
He told me to drive back and do it because it was far away.
I was supposed to follow as a driver but I didn't get the vaccine ㅜㅜ
My aunt, uncle, and father decided to go alone.
Oh, my cousin isn't even buying food!
There is a distance and a limit on the number of people, so you go as a representative.
That's right
There is also a limit on the number of people
We'll go later
Our wedding anniversary is just around the corner!
I don't take care of it anymore
Wow, what an important day this is!
I'll take care of it now
Do you know when the date is?
Carrot carrot
It's November 16th.
I knew the exact date
Child abuse
But it's funny that my friend's mother and father's wedding anniversaries are all around that time.
There aren't many weddings in November.
Oh, my aunt also got married two years ago on November 16th, right?
that's right
That was so amazing
How did you get the date right?
Yeah, that's right
There are a lot of weddings to go to in November.
that's right
I also have two weddings this month
Where do you want to go for your honeymoon?
I want to go to Australia!
Where did your mom go?
Mom went to Jeju Island
It seems like everyone except our family has animals.
What does your youngest aunt raise?
I think you've been raising fish recently.
What is the name of the fish?
Ah, you named it Spot Kiki
How long has it been since you raised it?
It's been about a month or two!
Where did you bring it from?
I heard there's a fish corner at E-Mart
You brought me from there
Yeah, I heard you're raising him really well.
When you raise an animal, you don't know how time flies.
Maintaining a fish tank is no joke
Daughter, don't you have any pets you want to raise?
Yeah... I really... I don't have confidence that I can take good care of the kids.
Then it's right not to raise it
I looked it up because I wanted to learn badminton.
Is there a place that gives lessons?
There's no place that does it late in the afternoon ㅜㅜ
I guess I should quit my job and study.
I want to learn both tennis and badminton.
When you quit your job and have more time, look into it again.
I guess so
I also want to do exercise wearing a dobok
Want to start Taekwondo again?
Oh no
That's not it
So what kind of exercise do you want to do?
I'm new to Jiu-Jitsu! Haha
This is a really new exercise
Do you have any friends who do Jiu-Jitsu around you?
no
Not at all
Kiki, you don't even know what Jiu-Jitsu is
Why did you think of Jiu-Jitsu?
It's a sport where you can win with just technique, regardless of weight class.
This is a total technical exercise.
Mom, are you good at Tetris?
It's fun
I installed it on my phone and use it often
Have you ever played Sudoku?
I used to buy a lot of books
There are even apps these days!
Can you play Sudoku on your phone?
How much can you do with an app?
Do you play any other games?
I don't play phone games much these days.
Do you play any other games?
I like going to board cafes and playing LumiCube.
How long does it take to do it once?
There is no set time, but sometimes it is long
When did you find out about that?
My friend told me about it and I was so hooked on it the day it happened.
Let's try
I wonder how long it will take
Mom, is there a place you want to go on a trip?
Let's go to Jeju Island later
Jeju Island, where we went for our honeymoon
I think I'd like to go with you now
Where did you go in Jeju Island this time?
I've been to Jeju City and Seogwipo City.
What was the most fun?
I rode a kart and oh my gosh I guess I was too nervous
My throat is sore
Where did you ride from?
I came from a place called Wind 1947.
Where else have you been?
I went to a place called 981 Park and played games there!
What games are there?
It's a place where you can do soccer, basketball, bowling, ski jumping, and other things!
Are you doing it all indoors?
Yeah, everyone's gathered on one floor indoors.
I bet you had more fun
What are you wearing to work these days?
Now dress warmly and go
I'm having trouble deciding what to wear because of the weather.
Now I have to pack warmly and go inside.
But then it's too hot on the subway...
I guess I'll have to carry my clothes
that's right
But the temperature is different for each train
It's amazing
The subway temperature varies depending on the season.
Correct answer...
It's winter outside, but it's really rainy summer on the train.
If it rains in the summer, does that mean it's humid?
Correct answer...
People are just sweating Kiki
You can't just dress according to the weather.
Majang
So I try to wear as many thin layers as possible.
okay
That would be a way too
I'm wearing clothes while thinking
Be careful not to catch a cold when it suddenly gets cold
I've been getting a lot of text messages lately about the lack of blood donations.
Where do the letters come from?
I got a text message from the blood donation center I always go to.
Haven't you donated blood recently?
I went... and got scammed 3 times...
Why didn't you go?
I had dental treatment once and it happened to me
Twice you said you couldn't do it because of iron deficiency...
There are many reports on the news about the shortage of blood donations.
So, if you donate blood, they will deduct traffic points.
How many points will you deduct?
They say they will deduct 10 points each time, up to 4 times a year, for a total of 40 points.
I guess it's a very lacking situation
So, it became a hot issue because a certain celebrity fan club donated a blood donation certificate in the celebrity's name.
I guess it's that necessary and urgent
That's right
But the idea is really good, fans
I heard that even rice and things like that are donated under celebrities' names.
There are places where 50,000 people are confirmed to have the same disease each day even though the vaccination rate has exceeded 70%!
Where are you talking about?
That's what they're selling in England right now ㅜㅜ
What about other countries?
The Beijing Olympics will be held in China in about 100 days...
Didn't China almost declare an end to it last month?
But there was a confirmed case!
Oh my god
The Olympics are being held with uncertainty again
It's probably not open to the public, but only to spectators who meet certain conditions.
But I'm worried if there are confirmed cases in China itself.
right...
If it's the Olympics, the people representing our country go there ㅜㅜ
They said there are about 100 days left until the Olympics, so they should be quiet before then.
that's right
They say it becomes more powerful when cross-vaccinated with Janssen and Moderna!
so?
How much difference is there?
There's a difference of about 76 times
Wasn't Yansan originally supposed to be a one-time thing?
How many Mac cushions did you order?
I did 3
Should I do more?
Oh no
I can't finish it this year
Ddangkyu
Does Mac fit you best?
Yeah... I've been going around here and there trying to get away from Mac, but it just doesn't work...
Aside from the Mac cushion, don't you use any other foundation?
Use Dermacol foundation!
Does that have good coverage?
Yeah that's awesome
It was originally sold a lot as a tattoo cover-up.
Just listening to it, I can tell that the coverage is considerable.
However, there is one drawback.
Is this a product that only has good coverage?
Uh...um...but it's a bit heavy to carry
The foundation is a bit heavier than BB cream
Is there much difference?
Yeah... really... matte haha
Are you using it correctly?
What kind of vitamins do you want to take?
I haven't even eaten what I have yet
later
Bring one to the company
Since I'm at home, I don't eat properly
Did you say you were getting a vitamin D shot or something?
Are you talking about magnesium injections?
that's right
That's it
Is that right for me too...?
We should go together and get it done
My daughter said there was a twitching under her eyes
Can't you just eat a banana?
There are things that can't be charged even with a banana
Ugh... I'll try that...
Didn't you say you'd get the flu shot?
I guess I should get a flu shot first.
Is this a shot party?
I'm going to finish this year by getting shots.
I'd be happy if I thought of it as a party
Oh, you are so positive, Mom.
Then wouldn't it hurt?
Brandy gave me a ton of points!
What is brandy?
point?
It's a place that sells clothes and such, but it's a zigzag-like place!
Why did you give points there?
I ordered same-day delivery last time, right?
Can clothes be delivered the same day?
Yeah! I ordered that but it didn't arrive on the same day.
Did you leave a direct inquiry?
Anning
It just came in automatically
This place has really good member management.
right
So I like it so I'm going to buy one
It's getting cold, so buy some clothes
Oh, there's a coupon too
What do they eat and live there?
They also give out positive coupons quite often
I guess I'll have to buy there often
It seems like all the songs these days are remakes
So this isn't a new song these days?
Most of the songs that were released before are re-released in versions or released by other people...
Recommend me a good song
I really like this because I love Lee Bo-ram
Mom, it's time to change your coloring too, so let me hear it
What is the coloring now?
Jessie's life will probably be fun
There's a new version of that too!
Mom made it the old one
Do you like any other songs?
I still like Ailee I'll show you
Wow, you're a huge fan of Ailee?
What Ailee songs does your daughter like?
I'm the evening sky! It's so good
I'll listen to that too
You know what?
I fell into Yumi's cells
Movies, dramas, cartoons, etc.
It was a webtoon, but it was made into a drama!
Have you read all the webtoons?
no...
It changed to paid...
Doesn't it appear in comic books?
There it was!
But I'm not really into comic books...
How about going to a place like a comic cafe and looking at them?
How about purchasing webtoons?
Is it that fun that you'd pay for it?
My friend bought me a blanket because Yumi's cells were too thin.
Where should I cover it?
Maybe the company...?
Is it okay?
It's obvious that you're a huge fan, right?
Uh... I have to cover it at home.
I haven't even taken it out yet
Keep it hidden at home
I guess it's because it's Wednesday today, but you look really tired. Did you have a cup of coffee?
Yeah, I even had two glasses today
Hey Kiki, what kind of coffee did you drink?
I bought two glasses of iced americano and iced vanilla latte.
Oh, you're also cold?
Okay, okay
Even if I freeze to death in the winter, it's ice
I also had an iced Americano as soon as I got to work today.
Was one glass enough to get you through?
Yeah yeah I was a little sleepy around the time I got off work, but I held on well Kiki
That's fortunate
I'm more afraid of tomorrow
Are you going to drink two glasses tomorrow like you did today?
I could probably drink more
I have the hardest time on Thursdays
Oh my, I got addicted to caffeine...
Is this the life of an office worker...
Kiki, if possible, drink something other than coffee.
thank you
I'll try my best Kiki
It's COVID-19 these days, what are you doing at home?
I usually watch Netflix in my bed
You're a bit of a homebody.
Yeah yeah I love my bed the most
Is this an environment where you can do anything in bed?
Hey, have you heard of a housewarming bed?
Oh, by any chance, does that desk thing move?
I just bought that recently Kiki
It's a jackpot
I've seen some celebrities use it though...
Kiki Oh, that's right!
That's what *** used on I Live Alone
Oh my gosh, really Kiki
Let me see it later
Yeah yeah come play anytime
I'll show you
I'm going to buy it right after seeing yours too
It's very possible, Kiki
When you say it like that, I'm really curious
You can taste real heaven
Did you use public transportation to go to work today?
No, today I drove there myself for the first time in a while
Oh, is your company close to your house?
Yeah, it'll take 15 minutes by car.
Wow, then it's worth driving
Right Kiki
There aren't many blocked sections, so it's good
When do you usually use the subway?
I use it a lot when I commute to and from work, and I always take it when I have an appointment in Seoul.
After all, Seoul's subway is the best
If you want to drive to Seoul right away, you have to be brave.
How long has it been since you started driving?
Well, I got my license a long time ago, but I've only been driving for about two years.
Then I guess I'll do well
no
Always scared and still can't
Kiki, it's always better to drive safely
That's why I'm going to drive safely until I die.
What are you doing at work these days?
I'm a bit busy this weekㅜ
Oh, so you work overtime too?
No, fortunately I'm not busy enough to have to work overtime.
That's fortunate
How long have you been working at the company?
I finished my training yesterday after 3 months!
Congratulations on your success
Now I have a really perfect full-time job
The response time was really fast...
If I become a full-time employee, will my salary increase?
No, our company gave 100% during training and the salary was the same.
It was a good company, Kiki
Usually they don't give 100 percent
I was surprised too
It was very good from the workers' point of view.
Then you must be pretty used to it now
No, I still don't know what you're talking about and it's hardㅜ
Ego, that's because it's a new job
Yeah so I'm trying not to get too discouraged haha
There are a lot of female soldiers around me.
Wow, really?
Where do you work?
There are two of them, and they are both discharged!
One is in the army
There's only one person around me, and he's a non-commissioned officer.
Oh, where do you work?
I'm in Gangwon-do now!
These days, I can't go out at all because of Corona.
I heard that vacations are really hard
I can't come out...
So...
I got a lot of military PX stuff from my sisterㅜ
What kind of gift did you get?
I received a gift of snail cream mixed with rice
How about the Matdasi product?
Kiki looks like delicious gochujang
It's my style
Oh, have you been to Kiki Pix?
Yeah, I've been in there a lot
Is the PX mask really cheap?
It was so cheap, wasn't it?
It's beyond imagination...
I just got my certificate delivered!
Wow, that must be so rewarding!
How are you feeling?
I feel like I'm flying!
I want to pass the 2nd level next year
What was the most difficult part of preparing for that?
When your skills don't improve...
The fight with myself was the hardestㅜㅜ
Aha, I'm curious about the test method. Tell me!
Each test has 5 minutes!
Wow, the evaluation will be over in 10 minutes?
Take two tests, one for argument and one for speech!
Yeah yeah! It's the end of the practical test.
oh my god...
What are you listening to and writing about?
The test of my life that I prepared for is actually over in 10 minutes...
Just take it literally and write it down!
Oh, is the test supervisor reading it there?
The broadcast is on!
Turn on the broadcast like an announcer!
Ah, that person's pronunciation must be good too
Since the speed is different for each level, the content is also different!
Wow, that's amazing.
I'm curious but I can't try
My mom said she needs a humidifier at work these days, so I gave her one as a gift. What did I give her?
I think I gave the Kakao humidifier as a gift!
What does your father do?
My dad is a science teacher
Wow, so you were good at science when you were young?
Well, I wasn't very good at it, but I liked it Kiki
So, when you didn't know something, did you ask your father?
Yeah, it was good for studying because I asked a lot of questions.
Oh wow, that's awesome
What does your mother do?
My mom is a housewife, but she sometimes helps out at her friend's cafe.
Wow, it must be hard for your mother to work at a cafe.
Kiki, you say it's hard, but I guess you're having fun
What does your brother do?
My brother just runs a small sushi restaurant.
Have you always been interested in food?
Yeah, I like cooking and I'm good at it.
Are you going to call me at the wedding?
then
Then you should sing the congratulatory song
What should I call you?
I like the song by the singer Nallora
know?
Oh, I know
Should I tell my friends to dance behind me?
Ake Kiki
If it's a dance that suits the song, then it's a must
My friends are good at dancing, so I should stand behind them.
Kiki, then you won't be embarrassed either.
that's right
Where do you want to do it?
Well, I haven't thought about it yet, but I want to do it somewhere with a nice atmosphere.
For dinner, what would you like to eat: buffet or galbitang?
It's a buffet, no matter what!
If you don't want to get cursed at by wedding guests...
Are you going to reserve a restaurant with transportation in mind?
Yeah, I don't think I can ignore that either.
I heard you fight a lot when you get married. Are you confident you won't fight?
I'm honestly not sure about that
I'm a bit stubborn haha
Nari hasn't been looking at you lately ㅜㅜ
Yeah, Nari is really a mommy's gum
Next to your mother, who does Nari follow the most?
I don't think there's anything after that... Kiki
I guess it's a world where only I and my mom live
Is it because Nari the cat spent the longest time with her mother?
Yeah, yeah Nari, when I was little, my mom was often at home so I liked her.
How did you end up raising a cat?
My grandmother's cat gave birth to kittens and I brought one home haha
Oh, how many puppies did you have?
I probably had about 4 at that time.
Wow, where did the other three go?
Go to another house or die ㅜ
How old is Nari now?
Nari is now 9 years old!
How old are you in human years?
Then maybe he's over 60?
I got PT counseling today!
Oh my gosh
How was the consultation?
There was a group pt that I found interesting
wow
So how many students are there?
It's a really amazing 8 to 1 deal!
That's amazing
What is the price range?
I need to cancel my 6-month gym membership to be able to take classes!
I see
Did you come see the group pt?
Yeah, I saw it!
I want to try both individual PT and group PT!
Oh, if you want to learn exercise properly, it's not a bad idea to go to a personal trainer and then move on.
I'm going to pay tomorrow!
What about the price range?
Do you think it's okay?
It's a bit on the strong side, but I like it because the facilities are so clean.
Aha, I think it's time for us to invest in our own physical strength.
that's right
Physical fitness is essential now...
Sigh...
I need to work out hard too!
I want to play games these days
What kind of games do you like?
It's been so long since I played Overwatch
You like Overwatch
Are you good at that?
I really like it!
Have you ever played Overwatch?
Have you ever tried Kiki?
A very, very long time ago
Ah, Kiki, what character was it?
The girl was riding some kind of robot...
I don't know the name
Diva!
Was she your girlfriend?
Oh, I think it's right now haha
Did you start from the beginning?
I've been working really hard since I was a college student.
Ake Kiki, you didn't go to class and go to the PC room, right?
After Kiki ended, I pretty much lived with my friends
thank god
Enjoy playing games after class
Don't you go to PC rooms often?
Yeah, I don't really like going to PC rooms.
I'm going glamping next week!
Have you been there?
Yeah, I went in September and the weather was really nice ㅜ
Wow, was it uncomfortable to go there?
There was none at all
I had a great time and had a lot of fun
Oh, where have you been?
I came back from playing in Chuncheon
How long does it take to get to Chuncheon?
Well, it took about 1 hour and 10 minutes by train from Yongsan.
Did you use public transportation when you went to Chuncheon?
no
I arrived in Chuncheon and rented a car haha
When you went in September, wasn't it hot or cold at night?
It was a little hot during the day, but it was nice and cool in the evening.
Weren't there a lot of bugs?
Yeah, there weren't many bugs there.
What is the name of the glamping place in Chuncheon?
It's a place called Instagram!
It was so cold in the office today
that's right
I also felt like my toes were falling off.
Are you turning on the heater in your office?
Yeah, I started playing it this week.
Does your company have a foot warmer or blanket?
Yeah yeah
There was a foot warmer in the office.
I'm going to sleep in my pajamas today because it's so cold
Ake Kiki
It's the kind of weather where you really need to put on your pajama pants and turn on the electric blanket.
Are you sleeping with the electric blanket on right now?
Yeah I'm already turning it down low and sleeping
What will the weather be like tomorrow?
I think tomorrow will be a little better than today?
Oh really?
Then I guess I'll have to wear a coat tomorrow too
I'm also planning to wear my coat tightly this week.
I used to love fall, but now it feels like fall is gone
Soㅜ
Give me back my fall...
Did you see the comments on the article that said it's open until midnight in non-metropolitan areas?
There are 3 stages there, so it was very easy!
There are many business owners who say they will stay open until midnight today even though there are no customers. ㅜㅜ
A moving era
I'm sure all the small business owners had a really hard time ㅜ
Corona is really making people suffer so much
therefore...
I hope the metropolitan area is also freed up soon so that we can all be happy together.
I think life has really changed a lot since we've put a time limit on it, right?
Yeah, I have to go home by 10 o'clock...
I feel a bit sorry
Since there is a limit on the number of people, it's kind of...
Now, wherever I go, I see a few people...
Seriously... it's a fact...
Since I spend a lot of time at home, I've become closer to my family, Kiki.
Oh that's right Kiki
After everything is resolved, it would be awkward if there was no time limit, like 00:00 or something, right?
As soon as you walk in, you'll probably be asked what time they close for business.
The word 24 hours is so awkward now
Kiki, really, back in the old days, all noodle restaurants were open 24 hours ㅠ
Yeah ㅜㅜ
Convenience stores will also be hit hard
Well, there's no one walking around like that...
Have you seen the American news?
no
What happened in America today...?
A mini helicopter crashed
Wow, awesome
Even if it's a mini helicopter, it's going to be huge.
Fortunately, everyone escaped!
Wow, I'm really glad there were no casualties.
They say there was heavy hail in Australia.
Do you know how big it is?
It's already hailing...?
How big is it?
There was an article saying it was as big as a grapefruit!
Wow... the grapefruit is bigger than I thought.
It must have been scary
There was a patient in Egypt with severe abdominal pain.
Do you know why?
Huh? What if it was made into an article about stomachache?
There is a man who swallowed a cell phone
But do you know when you ate it?
Oh, is that a cell phone?
When did you eat it...
Transactions made 6 months ago
When I asked why he didn't come to take it out... the answer was even more absurd...
Wow... 6 months ago...
Seriously, why didn't you go get it?
I cut my hair!
Oh I wonder
How much did you cut
It's really short because it's cut short
Oh, I think short hair would suit you well haha
Show me the real thing!
Kkurae!
I did personal color last time
What came out of you?
I did it this month too and the spring light came out!
you?
I have a winter cool tone!
I wanted to be cool-toned too, but I'm warm-toned ^_^
You and I are complete opposites, Kiki
What cosmetic color suits me?
Okay Kiki
I think orange-toned makeup and light colors go well with me.
Oh, you bought new cosmetics?
Yeah, I bought it because everything I had didn't match...
I bought one in purple because it looks good when it gets cold
Wow, it's amazing how purple suits you
Purple shadow looks so unfamiliar!
I'll show you that in real life too.
Be sure to use it when you meet me later
I haven't been exercising lately, so my physical strength has declined...
What about you?
I've been exercising regularly!
Now I need to take care of my physical strength
So ㅜㅜ
Do you have your own way?
I just do cardio and strength training at the gym.
When I go up stairs, I always walk without touching my heels!
Oh, then where is it good?
They say it strengthens your butt!
Oh, that's a great tip.
I'm working out my butt these days
Is the hip angle a squat angle?
Yeah, yeah
Kiki, your butt is too sagging, so I'm going to lift it up
I have no butt haha
Want to do a squat challenge together?
good
Squats for health
Steering Steering
Proof that you exercise every day!
If you do this kind of management together, time goes by quickly!
that's right
If you can't get certified, let's buy coffee.
Have you ever used Carrot Market?
I've installed the app and tried it out
Have you ever traded used goods?
Hmm... I don't think so!
Have you tried it?
I've done a few deliveries!
Oh, so you can also trade used goods through courier?
I've tried it in places like this in second-hand countries
What if I get scammed?
Uh um... Should I follow you...?
Kiki, when I got home today, there were a ton of packages.
Where did you get it done like that?
My mom ordered this and that from Coupang
Oh, oh, then it's okay
Very correct
My mom really can't live without Coupang...
There's always a box in front of my house too
Kiki, where do you guys often order from?
When will New Journey to the West 9 start...
I think they did film it
I said I would do it after Sixth Sense 2 ended, but I'm sad there's been no word yet
Oh my, Sixth Sense 2 is finished already?
Yeah, it's been a while!
Have you ever seen a variety show that doesn't harm you?
No, this is my first time hearing about that too
Do the Penthouse members know?
I know, I know
I watched up to season 2 haha
Among the members there, three male members are fixed and the other members take turns appearing as guests!
Aha, what program is that?
Country life!
Last week, actor *** appeared and I was like, &quot;Oh, wow&quot;, but there was a twist
Oh, this is fun, Kiki
It's like three meals a day, totally
Kiki is the intersection of that subdivision
They're really close friends
I need to find out who this guy named Oh *** is.
*** The actor's drawings are really good too
Oh, you're already so charming?
What was your favorite cartoon?
I like Shinchan the best
Did you see that I absolutely loved Dada?
I think I've heard of it, is it a baby coming out?
Oh right
so cute
Oh, then I think I remember it vaguely
I heard you're watching Crayon Shin-chan these days. Do you still watch it these days?
I tend to search and watch on YouTube
What do you search on YouTube?
If you just type in Shinchan Season 7 like this, they all come out and Kiki
What other cartoons have you read?
When I was a student, I watched Doraemon and Kiki sometimes.
To kill time
Doraemon Nobita is so cute
Which one do you like the best?
Hahaha I like Doraemon the best
I want to live together
Which do you watch more often, Tooniverse or Champ?
I was definitely a Tooniverse fan Kiki
I had Ashley's for dinner tonight
Oh, what are they selling there these days?
They sell a lot of different things
What did you eat most deliciously?
I like sushi so I ate a lot of sushi.
Oh, what else is delicious?
These days, they make rice noodles and pizza is delicious.
Oh, there are all kinds of Japanese food.
Yeah, so I think it's good to choose
What do you like best among Western, Japanese, Korean, and Chinese food?
I really like seafood, so Japanese food is my favorite.
Oh I'm into Chinese food these days Kiki
Oh, what food do you eat during lunch?
I'm so into spicy stew these days that I can't get out of it
I've never had mala-tang before
Come eat with me
I know a good restaurant
Have you lived in an apartment since you were young?
No, I lived in a house and then moved to an apartment when I was in elementary school.
What did you find convenient about living in an apartment?
At that time, the most exciting thing was that there was an elevator.
There wasn't an elevator in the old house?
Yeah, I didn't live very high up, but the stairs were hard.
Can I ask which floor you live on?
I lived on the 4th floor of a 5-story building at that time.
Wow, I hit the jackpot when I bought the house...
My house was also rented at that time.
If you think about the difference in rent prices between then and now, there's no answer.
Right... These days, I look into renting and then just buy it for a little more.
Yes, that is the reality
Is that right? When will the house be built?
So, at this price, I can suck my thumb and get a lot for free
The difference is so big that I'm confused
I'm going on a business trip soon and I have a new challenge.
Oh, what is it? What kind of challenge is it?
I have to take Line 9 to work.
Have you never ridden Line 9 during rush hour?
Yeah... I haven't ridden it... Have you ridden it?
Yeah, just think of it as you having no will.
Ah, can I just go with the flow?
Just follow the path the person in front of you is taking
Wow, this is how I can live.
This is a good tip and don't be greedy and try to get rid of everything at once.
Huh? Oh, you can't ride it all at once and the number of people keeps getting cut?
So you have to go out with plenty of time to spare
Wow, then I guess I'll just have to take it easy on the first day!
What subway station is this on Line 9?
I think it's probably the National Assembly Station!
Have you been to that subway station?
It's going to be really tough
This is my first time working outside the office!
You look happy. Is it because you're in a good mood?
It's amazing that it's the first time, everything is amazing
Yeah, enjoying it is the best
People are animals that adapt, so they will all adapt.
When you worked at other jobs, was your workplace just in one place?
Ah, during the security service, it was nationwide, so there was really no place for me.
Nationwide? You go all over the place? Anywhere?
Yeah, I was a specialist in nationwide business trips.
Wow, which one is the farthest?
I've been to Mokpo and Busan.
What was the longest period of time you were away on business?
I once traveled to 3 areas for 17 days.
Wow, wow, I can't even go home for 17 days?
Yeah, I took two days off a month back then...
There was nothing like this on weekends and weekdays
My friend is a career soldier, contact me!
Huh? What did you say?
Now the vacation is over
So the whole country is free of charge?
Instead, it seems like you can only walk around your residence
It is possible to take a vacation with restrictions
He's in the army and he's in Suwon!
But if a soldier gets caught, it's an emergency
That's right, since we all live together
Either way, it's too dangerous
So I came out and asked him what he wanted to do.
What did you say?
I just want to drink alcohol alcohol
Kiki, you're a friend who really likes alcohol.
No, I just want to drink. Kiki must be hungry.
If you stay there, it could happen
Do you remember your teachers when you were in school?
I remember my 4th grade teacher
Does it remind you of elementary school?
What kind of person was he?
He was an English teacher, and his English pronunciation was so charming.
Are you going well with your preparation for the Level 1 Computer Proficiency Exam these days?
I want to be satisfied with level 2...
Is level 1 really necessary?
They said that almost all 1st graders should have it ㅜㅜ
Do I just need to look at the level 1 practical test?
Yeah, I passed the level 1 written test.
Wow, it's amazing that the handwriting is still there
It was really hard because I failed the writing test several times.
Where did you take the test?
I saw it at the Bucheon Chamber of Commerce
Oh, I saw it at the Incheon Chamber of Commerce and Industry
There are two in Incheon, right?
My cousin is a Pilte instructor and I want to learn directly from her.
Oh, where do you work?
I'm doing it in Wonju, Gangwon-do
Have you ever been to Wonju?
Yeah, I go there often. I've only been to the parking lot.
Why did you go to the Kiki parking lot?
I dropped my sister off at work.
Oh, I bet your sister would have liked it
I don't like driving, but I do it all the time Kiki
Oh, then you would have liked it more
Yeah, yeah, so you had a good expression even though you were going to work
You must have been proud~ You did a great job
I'll have to bring it to you next time too
Is your cousin also an only child?
No, I have a younger sister who is 3 years younger than me!
It would be cute if my sister was 3 years older
You said you wanted to date these days!
Yeah right I'm hungry now
Let me look around me. What is my ideal type?
A tall person who looks good in a hoodie
Oh, I guess I'll have to put on the hoodie first.
Ah Kiki yeah I like hoodies
What kind of person do you like in terms of personality?
I'm someone who can have fun hanging out with others
Oh right, the time we spend together is important
I hope we have a good time together
It's important, it's important, I'll look it up
What is your ideal type?
I'm a pretty talker!
Is that okay? What about anything else?
I wish you would just speak nicely
I'll look for it too
You said you raised an iguana last time, right?
Yeah, I raised it when I was really young.
Why don't you raise it again?
It was harder to manage than I thought
Oh, that's true. How about raising a rabbit?
Then raise yourself first!
Sorry, my mom has a hair allergy.
I think I'm starting today too
Oh my, oh my, are you saying you don't like rabbits right now?
No, the rabbit is nice and pretty, but I can't imagine it coming into my house.
Ah, raising Kiki is different~
Yeah, you should see it at the zoo.
My grandmother used to raise rabbits!
That's amazing. Where did you grow it?
Kiki, you raised me in the yard
So I didn't go to the yard properly
Are you scared of rabbits? Of those cute rabbits?
Is your Pilates pass over now?
I have one left and I'm going next week
What kind of exercise are you doing now?
I'm running alone at the gym.
Oh, you can do it by yourself?
I can do simple things by myself
I told you too, I can't do it
Will you listen to me?
Will you listen to me if I tell you I'm sick?
No? That's all a lie.
Oh, Mr. Lee, I can't do it. I won't learn.
I'll teach you well. I have a body.
So, do you want to learn dodgeball from me?
Hey, why me to you?
I also have a dodgeball coaching license.
Oh sorry I hate ball games
Did you know there's a Nexon Computer Museum?
I think it was said to be in Jeju Island
Yeah, have you been there?
No, I only saw it in pictures
I went there recently!
Oh, what is it? Is it fun?
Yeah, I have all Nexon games
Are all those games free?
After paying the admission fee, everything is free!
So how much is the admission fee?
I think it was eight thousand won!
If I pay that and go in, everything is free?
Yeah, is that okay?
There's a lot to see
What game did you go and play?
I've been playing Tekken for a long time and I've been shooting guns and I'm almost done with it.
I should go there next time too
Is there a place you want to go on a trip abroad?
I want to go to Vladivostok, which you recommended
I have a plan in Excel, so I'll give it to you.
Thank you. You don't want to go again?
I want to go on a family trip
I guess it was really good to that extent
But I wonder if I can explain it well to you two.
So when we go with family, we always go with a travel agency.
Right, do you have any questions about Vladivostok?
Have you ever ridden the train there?
Yeah, it's really clean and the space is spacious.
How did you mainly get around?
I took the train, subway and walked most of the way.
Is the place you're looking at within walking distance?
I planned it all like that and even chose my accommodation like that.
Please show me that Excel
What do you use at home, an electric blanket or a hot water mat?
Our house has an electric blanket. What about you?
I'm hot, mom and dad are hot too!
Don't you need to fill the water mat with water?
That's true, but it takes longer than you think!
It's getting cold these days, so I have to take it out
Have you seen something that expresses the weather?
Hey, what's that? Tell me.
Boohoooo ...
It's perfect. Summer feels really long Kiki
Where did fall really go?
Who is it that brings autumn when you say nice things?
So ㅜㅜ do you like fall the best?
I actually like summer
Wow, why do you think that?
What's wrong with you?
I don't feel the heat very well
Have you been to Sokcho recently?
No, why not?
As of midnight on the 22nd, it has been lowered to level 2!
Wow, it's been a while since I've heard of a 2-step thing
So, fortunately, it seems like the non-metropolitan areas are gradually falling.
Okay, everyone needs to get back to normal now...
Come to think of it, yesterday was Wednesday. How many confirmed cases were there?
There are more today...
Wow, how much? Even though it's Thursday today?
As of 6 o'clock, 141 more people came out...
Oh, so how many people are there in total?
As of 6pm, 1216 people are in the lab
Still, it doesn't go up to 2,000 people.
Yeah where is that really
I was surprised when you said it was three digits before.
Now just four digits...
Have you seen the accidents that kids have in China?
No, why China again?
I'm angry even without listening
My father's insurance money, who passed away in 2019, has just been paid out...
Yeah, why are you out so late?
That's about 40 million won in our money.
How do children manage that?
My aunt is raising me now
Oh, then your aunt will take care of it~
But I think my brother played a game on my aunt's phone
Wait a minute, cell phone...? Why are you anxious?
But I squandered all my money on games, including the adult verification...
Wow, that much money for a game?
So, that's also father's death insurance money...
Oh, how many children are they?
Elementary school student, 10 or 11 years old
I'm so upset... I lost my father's insurance money...
I'm into eyelash perms these days
Oh I've never done it before, when?
I like it because it makes me feel comfortable and pretty when I put on makeup
How much does eyelash perm cost?
It varies from store to store, but the place I go to costs 30,000 won.
It's cheaper than you thought?
How long does it take to maintain?
I think it'll take 6 or 7 weeks
Wow, the staying power is the best. Please let me know. I want to try it too.
Do you still do your nails often these days?
No, you're not doing it because your nails are damaged.
I'm receiving it regularly. Should I tell you about a nail strengthener?
Yeah, tell me, I'm really serious...
I'm using Innisfree products and they're good.
Thank you, I'll buy it tomorrow
If there is an Innisfree around your company, you have to go there.
I have to look it up before I go to bed tonight, Kiki
I had an InBody test yesterday and my body fat increased...
Oh my gosh, I'm so upset ㅜ
Yeah, so I'm going to work out hard again
I think losing body fat is really difficult.
Do you also do InBody sometimes?
I also go to the gym once a month haha
Oh, then do you see the change well?
No, Kiki, it wasn't as visible as I thought.
What kind of exercise do you often do at the gym?
I do cardio and muscle training every day Kiki
Oh please tell me too I'm curious about the routine
On days when you work your back, do it with your lower body, and on days when you work your chest and shoulders, do it with your lower body.
Wow, it's so systematic and cool
Kiki, I also got this information from people around me.
So, do you also study exercise on YouTube?
Yeah, I like watching other people exercise on YouTube.
Does your mother often shop at the mall?
Oh, don't be ridiculous... There's a package in front of my house every day.
Ah Kiki, you look just like my mom
Where does your mother often go shopping?
Order from Hyundai Home Shopping, Lotte Home Shopping, CJ, and everywhere else.
Wow, are you satisfied with the Kiki products you ordered?
No... I think if you buy 10 you'll return 8 of them Kiki
Kiki's mother, you'll end up on the blacklist
Even though I say that every day, you don't listen...
Have you ever bought anything at the mall?
No, I actually don't like online shopping.
Oh really? Why don't you like it?
I hate things like clothes because I can't measure their sizes accurately.
Oh, right, so the probability of failure is high
That's why I feel more comfortable just going to the store and buying it.
It's a little expensive, but I guess that's good.
Wow, it's Thursday today so there's nothing worth watching on TV
There really isn't any entertainment to watch on Thursdays.
Did you see them hitting the goal yesterday?
Yeah yeah I see that a lot
Oh really? Who are you rooting for?
I support Choi Yeo-jin and Kim Jae-hwa in Actionista.
I like Song Hae-na, who is tall and slim. Kiki
Oh, that person has a really good personality and is really cute.
I wish you were my friend right now
How cute you are Kiki
Let's ask him first
Kiki, would you mind talking to me?
What entertainment shows do you watch on the weekends?
I'm a Running Man fanatic. I really like it.
Ah Kiki, I like Running Man. I watch it sometimes too.
Running Man these days is seriously **ah Kiki it's so funny I'm dying
Are you a total diehard fan? Kiki
Wow, it's been a really long time since I've been to the movies.
Yeah, but how much do movies cost these days?
I saw it passing by today and it was 13,000 won
Wow, 13,000 won? When did the price go up so much?
So the real price of the movie is over 10,000 won...
That's ridiculous...
Oh, I heard a new Disney movie is coming out soon.
I wonder what kind of animation it is?
I guess it's something that invites you to a fantastic world of magic.
Oh I love Disney haha
You have to see it at the cinema.
Yes, you absolutely have to watch Disney in the theater.
I really enjoyed watching Zootopia
What do you like about Disney?
I like Moana haha and the song is really good too
I think all Disney songs are masterpieces
It's really addictive and I love it all
I have to listen to Disney songs on my way to work tomorrow.
Oh, I'm listening to Kiki while getting ready for work too
Chicken feet are the best on Friday nights!
Oh really, I want to eat chicken feet too
Kiki I ate boneless chicken feet yesterday and it was really delicious ㅜ
Oh, I really like boneless chicken feet too.
I even ate steamed eggs~ So delicious~
It would be fantastic if you could make steamed eggs too
Yes, Kiki, and don't forget the rice balls~
Yes, you really know how to eat
Kiki Of course, but it was so spicy that I thought I would die after eating it for a long time!
Oh really, I want to eat it every day, even if it's spicy
Kiki, do you like spicy food!?
Oh, it's really not a bluff
Eat well
You're not bluffing, you're serious, right?
Oh, no kidding, eat well
Why is it like this
Kiki, really? Then can you eat level 4 of Yeop-tteok?
Yeah, of course
I can eat it
After all, no matter what, the electric blanket is the best~
Electric blankets are the best when it's cold.
Kiki, that's right, I didn't go out either. I thought it might be cold~
Oh it's so cold outside
padding particles
Yeah Kiki but I'm at the padding store ㅜ
Oh really, you came out and lived alone? Haha
Oh, I'm living alone right now!
Oh really, how many years have you been living alone?
It's not a few years, it's 10 months now~
Oh really, it's been 10 months already
Kiki, that's right, it's already going to come out in two months ㅜㅜ
Why are you coming out after two months?
I want to go out and live too
Now that my contract is up and I'm out, I'm going to go somewhere else!
Oh really, where are you going?
i envy you
No, I think I'll probably go down to my parents' house!
Ah, it would be nice to go back to my parents' house
Is your company close to your house?
I live 10 minutes away from work.
Come on foot or by car?
I drive a foreign car
Wow, wow, you make so much money!?
Um I work for a construction company
Kiki, wow, what's your job title?
I am the manager
I can't make money
You're a manager, but don't you feel awkward if you drive a foreign car?
Ah, everyone drives foreign cars so I picked that one too
Kiki, wow, what's your car paper?
I drive an Audi haha
It's nothing
Wow Kiki, that's perfect,
When will I be able to drive a foreign car?
Don't you have a car right now?
Do you take a taxi?
I'm in Seoul so I take the subway.
Ah, the subway is convenient.
Isn't the company you work for now difficult?
Yeah, it's okay if it's a little hard because of your boss.
Oh my, why is my boss harassing me?
My boss does too many things
Oh my god, Kiki, but you don't know that you are?
Ah, it's really hard, as if you don't know
Kiki, I killed you with alcohol at the company dinner later!
I'll have to get drunk and have some fun later.
Kiki, good idea
Is that boss the only one who does that?
Yeah, that boss is the only one who's too bad
Huh, are you a direct shooter?
Are you an unavoidable person?
Yeah, he's someone you can't avoid
Mud mud ㅜㅜ What is that person's position?
You are the agent, you are the evil agent
Wow, it seems like he's taking out all his stress on you!
I think it's right. The manager is also severe.
How old were you when you enlisted in the military?
I went to the military when I was 20.
Oh really? You really went and came back early!
Yeah, I wanted to work quickly, so I went to the military first.
Oh, really? So you were discharged when you were 22?
Yeah, I was discharged in the winter when I was 22.
Wow Kiki winter, yeah it's lonelier when it's cold out there,
It was good that we came out in the winter!
Yeah, you worked so hard
Sister, do you want to go to the military?
Kiki No! I've been in the military, but I don't want to go!
Kiki, have you really been there? When?
Kiki, I went there to work part-time~
Oh really, part-time job? What part-time job?
There's a cafe inside there, right?
I worked there!
Oh, it must have been really popular
Kiki, huh? Popularity? Not like that,
Why isn't there something like that?
I think there will be a lot
What subject were you best at when you were young?
I was best at physical education
Wow, awesome Kiki! It seems like guys like sports the most!
Yeah, men don't like sports.
What did you do best, sister?
Kiki, back then I liked math the most!
Oh, math is really cool.
Kiki, I also received math tutoring back then~
Sister, you even received private tutoring. You must have studied hard.
Kiki: Yeah, but can you tell me what the problem is?
Oh, I really wonder what it is
In terms of scores, math is 100 points, but other subjects are 20 points.
Oh, you really got 100 points?
stylish
Kiki, but your other subjects are completely bad~
I was really bad at other subjects
Kiki: That's right, I had a hard time with morals back then!
Oh really, morality was easy for me
What is your family structure?
I have two older brothers and one younger sister.
Oh really? Then you're the third one?
I am the third
Stuck in the middle
What's the bad thing about Kiki's third child?
The only bad thing is that they don't take good care of you because you're the third child?
Kiki, how old are you and your older brother?
My eldest brother and I are two years apart
Haha not really
Kiki Oh, so you're all perennials?
Yeah right Kiki's mom and dad love her so much
Kiki, your parents' prohibition of drinking is no joke, huh?
Oh right, you guys are so nice haha
Kiki, then how old are you now?
I'm 24 years old
Sister? How old are you?
Oh, then your second older brother is the same age as me!
Oh really, then you're 25 years old
How many girlfriends have you had so far?
I met 5 people
Haha just a little bit
Kiki, how old were you when you first met?
We met when I was 19
Kiki not so much
Oh, your first love started later than I thought?
Yeah, I had my first girlfriend when I was 19.
I see, but weren't you in a co-ed school?
Oh, my school was coeducational.
Oh really? Are you the friend we met at school back then?
No, I dated a kid from another school
Oh, I see. So you met through Kiki's introduction?
No, it wasn't an introduction, we were friends
Oh really? We've been friends since elementary school?
No, we've been friends since middle school
Wow, how was it when Kiki went from being friends to lovers?
It was funny at first, but I liked it when I met him.
Do you have any pets at home right now?
No I don't have any pets
I see. Haven't you ever wanted to raise a puppy?
Yeah, that's right. I want to raise one, but my parents don't like it.
I see ㅜㅜ Your parents don't like hair flying around, right?
Yeah, that's right. What do you mean by hair loss?
ㅜㅜ There are dogs that don’t shed much hair!
Oh, what is this dog that really doesn't shed hair?
As far as I know, it's Maltese!
It's even cute!
Oh my, you're so cute, I'm raising my friend too
Kiki, really? I raised one too!
Maltese is so cute!
Oh really, but where did you go?
Ah, I'm sick now and I'm in heaven! ㅜㅜ
Oh, what a sad story
Sorry
So ㅜㅜ I set a date for the surgery, but I couldn't hold out and passed away before that ㅜ
Oh, you must have been really sad
cheer up
They say men like to fish. Is that true?
No I like wakeboarding
Wakeboarding? Someone told me about that. What was it?
Oh really? You go to the river and ride it like a board.
Oh right, Kiki, isn't that kind of hard to keep your balance?
Still, I rode it once
Oh really? You don't need to get any education on that?
It costs 50,000 won to receive training once. It's expensive.
Wow, awesome. So it's a one-day course for 50,000 won?
Yeah, not a day, but 50,000 won for 15 minutes
Wow Kiki, then it's 50,000 won for a 15 minute ride?
If you ride it three times, it will cost over 100,000 won
Kiki, is that why you charge so much for the equipment itself?
Yeah, because you rent equipment and go out on a boat.
Kiki and daebak oh that's right
It must cost a lot to launch a boat!
Yeah, so I came here in the summer and my bank account is empty.
When you were a student, did you often go to PC rooms with your friends?
Yeah, I lived every day like that
Kiki, you had dinner there too, right?
Yeah, there are a lot of delicious things in PC rooms these days.
Kiki: So what did you do with your friends back then?
I liked playing star games with my friends
Wasn't LoL the most popular back in your day?
LoL is popular now and I liked old games
Oh, I see. The only Kiki Star I know is Honggu!
Oh really, I did it because the kids did it so much
Kiki, really? You went to the PC room after school, right?
No, I skipped school a lot and went
Wow, Kiki's liver is really swollen!?
Kiki, why do you talk so scary? ㅠㅠ
Kiki, if I had known my parents back then I would have told you!
Ah, seriously, Kiki, don't make me mad
Have you traveled recently?
Yeah, I went to Yeosu.
Yeosu? When did you go there and come back?
I went there about a month ago
Ah, that must have been a perfect day to go to Yeosu!
Yeah, that's right, it's not that hot
Kiki, you know that when you go to Yeosu, you go to a romantic pocha, right?
Yeah, that's right, I definitely went with my friends.
Kiki, did you go on a trip with your friends?
Yeah, I went with my friends and had fun.
How many of Kiki's friends went with you?
I went with 4 friends and it was so much fun
Oh, I see. How was Kiki's accommodation?
As for accommodation, we were men so we just slept in a motel.
Did you sleep in pairs at the Kiki Motel?
There were two beds in the motel, so we slept in twos.
Did you go out today?
Yeah, I just came in after eating ribs
Wow, I'm jealous, what was the weather like outside?
But it was so cold...
Home is the best
Oh really? You said the weather was nice outside today?
Oh seriously, I went out wearing short sleeves
Kiki: That's why, why are you wearing short sleeves in this weather?
Oh, I went out because they said the weather was nice today
Kiki, I see. Kiki, you went out without even bringing an outer garment?
Yeah, I didn't pack it
I'm a real man
Kiki is a manly man, but you can't stand that cold!?
Oh, sorry... I can't stand the cold.
Kiki admit Kiki I didn't open the windows at home Kiki
Oh, I think you'll catch a cold a lot, sister
Kiki Of course I catch a cold easily!
Oh, really be careful
Wear padding and go out
Did you know that our country launched a rocket this time?
Huh? I really didn't know.
Yeah, Kiki Nuriho was launched a few days ago!
Oh wow that's really cool, rocket launch
Kiki: That's right, but in the end, they didn't make it to the moon!
Oh, then it would have been a waste not to be able to go to the moon
Kiki: Well, this time it was a test launch, so I kind of expected it!
Ah, I really have to look forward to it later
That's right, they're launching again in May next year!
It won't be long until May next year.
That's right, if you successfully enter this time, you'll be sent for real in 9 years!
Oh, that's really cool
I want to see it too
Kiki Me too, but do you know how much it costs to launch one of these?
How much does it cost to fire one shot?
It's in units of 1 trillion?
Wow, right!?
It costs a lot of money!
Huh? The sunlight is crazy, really awesome
Ogames are totally popular in our country right now!
Oh, I know
It's really so much fun
China plagiarized our program again~
Oh really, China plagiarized it?
Kiki Oh, now I made a program that says Ogem is the squid's victory
Oh, why is China like that?
You're a copycat
Kiki, but here, Running Man and other programs have plagiarized a lot too!
Ah, Running Man is fun
So it's worth plagiarizing
But this time, the Chinese people fiercely criticized him, saying that he was ashamed!
Oh really Kiki, this must be embarrassing
Kiki That's right, so in the end they canceled the program Kiki
Ah, it's embarrassing enough to disappear
Kiki, so it ends with just a preview Kiki
Ah, we need to make sure that something like that doesn't happen in our country.
But it's okay to buy the trademark of that program as long as it's not plagiarized!
Oh really, the program doesn't matter
Don't you wear makeup or anything?
Oh man, what kind of makeup is that?
Kiki why is my boyfriend wearing makeup!
I just put on sunscreen and that's it
Kiki, but where is the sunscreen!
Yeah, you have to apply it for your skin.
Kiki, that's right, my boyfriend also makes sure to apply it to me Kiki
Otherwise it'll be completely blackened
I envy your boyfriend
Kiki no, she only applies it when I apply it, she doesn't apply it herself.
Oh really, men are annoying
Kiki, that's right, but my boyfriend really uses BB cream too?
Oh my gosh, Vivi is really awesome.
Kiki, you're awesome! You must have more cosmetics than me!
Wow, really, why is that... Kiki
Kiki, these days even men wear makeup~
Okay, please understand, I'm a man so I won't understand haha
Why has my head been hurting so much since a while ago?
Oh, I'm dizzy too
Why is that so?
Oh really? Is this because I got hit by the cold wind?
But when the seasons change, kidney stones also come out a lot.
Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo? What are the symptoms?
Yeah, I have a disease called dizziness. When I stay still and then turn to the side, I feel dizzy.
I see. If it gets worse, you might vomit?
Ah, I might really throw up ㅠㅠ
Yeah, a lot
Wow, what would I do with that?
Oh really, that's not it
You must have a cold
ㅜㅜ So it might be because the air in my room is cold right now!
Ah really Kiki, turn on the boiler
Kiki, that must be it. Why are you sick?
I think I'm sick from stress
Oh, did something stress you out today?
I was stressed out from working all day today.
Do you use your card a lot too?
Yeah, I use check cards a lot too
But how did you pay for that foreign car?
Oh, I'm paying it off in installments.
Wow Kiki, is this really a 100% installment plan!?
Yeah Kiki Baek Pro, where is the money?
Wow, awesome Kiki. How long do you have to pay that back?
I guess I'll have to pay it back in about two years? ㅠㅠ Sigh
Wow Kiki, how much do you pay per month?
I'm paying about 800 thousand won
Wow, but can you live off your salary? Paying it off like that?
I'm okay living at home
I'm jealous Kiki. Then where did you borrow money to buy it?
Oh, I got a loan from Nonghyup Bank.
How much does Kiki Wao pay?
It's okay because the interest rate isn't that high
What's the most entertaining entertainment show you've seen recently?
I'm having fun watching Spau
Oh, you're talking about Supa?
Is that dancing?

I dance to that with my friends all the time

I've watched Fashion King a lot
Ah, creepy Kiki. Is that the Return of the King series being serialized now?
Have you seen your sister every day?
I'm watching the Return of Superman
Kiki I am the fashion king. After turning into that wolf, I got off Kiki
Oh seriously I really like Kian84
Kiki I also really like Kian84 ㅜㅜ
I hope you continue the series!
It's so weird, but still so well drawn
Kiki: Yes, I think it's better to draw in a way that catches the eye rather than drawing well!
The content is fresh and fun
I'm like this
Kiki, that's right, it feels exactly like you!
Yeah, that's right, you think so too, sister.
Kiki: Yeah, I thought it was you the moment I saw you!
Oh really, why did you think that?
That would be good
Mom, what are we going to eat when we meet our friends today?
I haven't decided yet. Can you recommend something?
Where did you say you were going?
I'll meet you at Yeonsu Station
If it's Yeonsu Station, there's also gopchang and makchang!
What is the name of the restaurant?
It's a chain called Gwangmyeong Daechangjip, and the Yeonsu branch is famous.
Do you cook all the tripe and makchang?
Oh my, it's so good that you grilled it all over charcoal.
I can eat comfortably. I'll go.
Then the cafe is not available?
Then, can you recommend a cafe too?
Actually, the cafe is Starbucks Kiki
What menu do you eat often?
I'm into cold brew these days
Then I'll try it
When are you going to finish the construction on our house?
The weather is nice so we should do it soon
Have you decided on the interior design?
This time I'm going to do it in white
White is nice and clean
Because it's black, you can see all the dust that's accumulated
Oh, that's right, but you could wipe it off before the dust accumulates, right?
But it all gets covered in dust
Such health...haha maybe because I left the veranda door open
Yeah, it'll be even better if you open the veranda too.
If you open it, the house will be bigger
But I'm still thinking about it
Why? What are you worried about?
They say it's too cold in the winter
Is it too hot in the summer...?
I'm worried because it might be possible
Have you been to Incheon Terminal recently?
No, why didn't you go?
When you originally went to Wonju, there was a QR code!
Did you submit it as a form?
Yeah, oh my goodness, but now it's a QR code!
So, has it changed now?
Yeah, that's why I took a QR code and rode yesterday!
Where can I get the QR code?
You can get it if you reserve it through the intercity bus app.
Are you using that app to check the time and make a reservation?
Yeah, that's right, you can do it right on your phone.
How long does it take from Incheon Terminal to Wonju Terminal?
It originally said it would take over 2 hours, but I think it took about an hour and 40 minutes!
Isn't the traffic congested?
Yeah, yeah, it's blocked for a moment, but it doesn't block very well
Thank goodness you had a nice trip

Yes, it absolutely must be there
Mom, do you have any questions about the military?
I don't know very well
Are there any areas you're curious about, Army, Air Force, or Navy?
I'm curious because the Air Force is the most unfamiliar to me
Unfortunately, I'm the only one among my friends who isn't in the Air Force.
Is there a naval army?
There are female soldiers from the Navy, female soldiers from the Army, and active-duty soldiers.
Are you all discharged?
Yeah, it's so strange that both of you got discharged from the military at the same time.
Are the Navy and Army service periods the same?
Anning, the Navy is a bit longer!
Until what age can female soldiers apply?
I think it's 27 years old or 26 years old.
It's a lot shorter than I thought
I guess that's why physical strength is important
That could be possible
I saw a really amazing teacher on TV.
Who appeared on TV?
An elementary school teacher came out and the education was amazing.
What kind of training do you provide?
They teach us the concepts of taxes and salary in advance through early education.
Do you teach us about salaries and taxes in class?
Yeah, it's a really refreshing education.
But it may be the most important education
Yes, actually, things like how to sew are good, but I think it would also be good to have realistic education that teaches things like how to sign up for insurance.
Yeah, it would be good to tell you in advance how to do it by yourself.
Yeah, that's right, that's what I need the most
How to avoid being scammed This would also be good
Yeah, that's why the teacher on TV looked so cool.
What did you learn in tech and home economics class?
I see you're having trouble thinking...
Yeah, I only remember the subjects.
Is your grandmother feeling better?
They said they're having surgery in December.
How did you get hurt ㅜㅜ
Your wrist has been in bad shape for a while, but I think you got hurt this time.
But why December and not right now?
He said he was late because he had to make kimchi.
Oh my god no, my hands are important to my body ㅠㅠ
It's hard to say because you're so firm
Oh, I see. Your grandmother has already made kimchi, right?
Dad went alone because he said he did it yesterday
Dad, did you go alone?
I went to my grandmother's house with my grandmother.
Is your grandmother in good health?
I'm glad you're okay. I heard you're going to the hospital regularly.
Of course, you have to go to the hospital regularly
Let's also go there regularly and take preventive measures
My school teacher got married today.
So, did you have a good trip?
I didn't go
Have your other friends been there?
Yeah, I only received it in pictures!
Where did you get married?
Got married at Sosa Station
There's a bit of distance
Yeah, teacher, your workplace is right in front of my house, and you got married there!
I guess it was based on place of residence~
I think marriage usually takes place at either the place of residence or the place of work?
It's mostly done around the men's workplace
Aha, choosing a region is also a job
Most of the time, the date and location are decided at the meeting.
I see. Marriage is really hard.
Yes, marriage is not prudent
Is your cousin's puppy growing well?
The yard is under construction right now.

Mom goes and gets names mixed up all the time
Even if I look, I still can't tell...
It's even more so because it's all the same paper
Yes, they are all the same color
The name is also very interesting
Who came up with the name?
My great aunt just came to mind
Okay, I'll definitely remember that next time.
Next time I go, I'll call without making a mistake
Have you ever been to a ski resort?
No, do you have a daughter?
Yeah, I just got back from school!
Why haven't you been there since then?
I don't know how to have fun
Wasn't it fun last time you went?
It was difficult because it was like a test
What test did you take?
I took the test on everything I learned and the details, but I was scared because it was at the intermediate level.
Aren't your friends going to ask you to go together?
But I'm not going
Do you go swimming in the summer?
I don't go often and I don't like playing in the water either!
You don't play any seasonal sports?
Yeah, I guess so now that I think about it

No... the food wasn't that good
What was the famous food?
Wonton noodles are famous, I can't eat them
This food doesn't suit my taste.
Yeah, yeah, but there was one thing that was delicious
So what happened?
It's called hot pot and it's shabu-shabu and it's the most delicious.
Do we have hot pot in our country too?
Yeah, that's right, but I haven't tried it in Korea yet.
Let's go eat it next time we go to Hong Kong
It's not that cold this week anymore
Thank goodness winter will really come soon
Right, do you like snowy days?
I like watching it snow
Is that not right?
Snow is better than rain
How about watching the rain?
I really like the sound of rain
Yes, there are some that only let you hear the sound of rain.
Do you have a snowball fight when it snows?
I don't even touch my eyes
Are you not touching it because your hands are numb?
Anning, my hands are dirty, so it's not good
Do you bring an umbrella on rainy days?
No, I get rained on often...
Take good care of yourself now
The vaccination rate has exceeded 70%!
Is something changing now?
I think so
Have restaurant operating hours changed a lot now?
Yeah, 3rd stage karaoke is open until 10pm and restaurants are open until 12am
Is step 4 the same?
Do you know why only the reading room study cafe is open 24 hours?
Is there any reason?
They say it's because the college entrance exam is coming up soon
It was solved to fit the CSAT
Yeah, but I think that's a good thing
If you can't study, it will have a big impact.
I do use study cafes a lot.
Have you ever been to a study cafe?
Haha I haven't been there
Come visit next time
The Beijing Olympics are just around the corner...

The number of confirmed cases is rapidly increasing
I'm worried that our country will start soon too
Yeah, they said they were worried too

There was a 6.5 magnitude earthquake in Taiwan.
There is a place I want to get plastic surgery on.
Where do you want to go?

What does your nose want to do?
I want to get a reduction surgery or a nose job
What do you want to do with your forehead?
I want to put it in convexly
Which of the two are you more worried about?
I'm more worried about my forehead
Why are you more worried about your forehead?
Seriously... it hurts. My head really hurts.

The anesthesia wears off and it really hurts
What about your nose?

I'll have to think a lot about fillers
Are you feeling sick these days?
I have a little chest pain after getting my second dose of the vaccine.

My back hurts more these days.
How long has it been since you had back surgery?
It's already been 7 years
Oh, management is important.
They say core strength is very important
I know that, but do you exercise?
Sometimes... Instead, I do walking exercise often.
Walking is the most important thing
Okay, I'll try to keep doing it
Do you use Naver Shopping often these days?
Naver is convenient though
Have you written down all the payment information?
Yes, if you just touch it, the payment is made right away.
Can I pay with just a touch on Coupang?
Yeah, that's right, so I don't really know how much to spend
So I often pay with my mom's phone
I should hide my phone
I'll find them all
These days, even the luxury goods advertised are all sold online.
Yes, there are a lot of apps
What is the name of the app?
There are about three, but I can't remember.

He drives well and has had car accidents.
As expected, foreign films are big in scale.
That's why I like foreign movies more

Among the movies, I remember Train to Busan the most.
I had pork cutlet for lunch today for the first time in a long time.

What kind of tonkatsu did you eat?
I like sweet potato cheese donkatsu so I ordered that Kiki
Wow, you ate the most delicious thing, Kiki
What did you eat for lunch?
It's been a long time since I ate cheonggukjang
Wow, I've never had cheonggukjang before...
Doesn't it smell bad?
Yeah, it's a bit spicy, but it's still delicious.
You're a real adult, aren't you? You even eat fermented soybean paste stew.
I just started eating it too
Are there a lot of good restaurants near the company?
Rather than calling it a good restaurant, I think it's more like eating to survive
But what was the most delicious food you've ever eaten?
I ate the braised codfish and it was so delicious Kiki
My friend has been independent for 3 years already.
Wow, you became independent quickly, my friend.
Yeah, I feel envious but also sad.
Why? It seems like it would be really good.
If you live alone, you get sick alone and eat alone, so you get lonely.
I think you have to experience it to really understand it.
I can't imagine when I'll be independent
But if you get a good position at the company, it might be possible right away, right?
My goal is to become independent as soon as I become a full-time employee at the company.
Are you going to invite me to your housewarming party?
Of course, both hands should be heavy Kiki
If there's anything you want, just tell me and I'll listen.
Was my friend a cool guy all year?
Kiki may have a price limit
I actually want to live in a house with an elevator
Elevator is important, you want a high floor?
Yeah, it's probably only 4 or 5 stories high, but Kiki
Still, it's less noisy and better from above haha
I'll take the train to Gangneung tomorrow!
Oh, the train ride sounds fun.
It's been so long, I'm excited. Where have you been by train recently?
I went to Gyeongju and Chuncheon Kiki
Oh my, you ride it more often than I thought.
Yeah, taking the train is really convenient.
Did you go to Gyeongju by taking the KTX?
Yeah, I rode it for the first time that day and it was super fast...
I've never ridden the KTX before ㅜㅜ
I don't know if it's just me, but my ears were so stuffy that I felt a bit uncomfortable...
Oh, what does that feel like? I wonder
I felt really suffocated when I went through the tunnel.
Did you know that even trains have social distancing measures these days?
Oh yeah, when I went to Chuncheon, all the seats next to me were empty.
Corona really changed the world...
Seriously... That's why I couldn't go with my friend and went separately ㅜ
How's the company doing these days?
I think I can just get by somehow. What about you, Kiki?
I feel like I've lost a lot of my freedom since I started working at the company ㅠㅠ
Now... this routine is just repeating itself...
Isn't it really that scary?
Even if I want to play, I can't play to my heart's content...
I think that saying is really true, even if you have money you don't have time.
Wow, I really empathize with this...
Of course I don't have much money, but Kiki
I suddenly felt the burden of having to work my whole life.
ㅜㅜ But don't feel too pressured. Just take a break and then change jobs again.
It must be difficult to change jobs these days, right?
Maybe soㅜ
First of all, it seems like my standards have risen...
Hah... I think it would be best to increase my value and get scouted.
Kiki admits... Let's build up our work capabilities
Good. I have to work harder to prepare for the certification.
I should study with you too, Kiki
I saw DP recently and my brother-in-law was in that position.
Wow, really? You're so cool.
I heard it was really hard to go and catch the deserters.
Yeah, I think it would be scary to do something like that...
If you listen closely, there are police officers in the military.
Oh... That's awesome... I bet it was a huge hit back then.
The old army was really scary
Just listening to my brother's story, it's not easy...
What disease did your brother have?
My brother was a cook so it wasn't that hard.
Oh, I heard that cooks don't receive training. Is that true?
Yeah, I think I got it!
But I don't think I received much because I had to cook for the other trainees.
I see. It must have been hard there because there were so many of them...
My brother said waking up in the morning was the hardest part, Kiki
Ah, people who sleep in a lot in the morning must really have a hard time with cooking sickness
Kiki, my older brother used to sleep in a lot in the mornings.
When you have children later, how are you going to educate them?
Well, I'm not sure because it's too far in the future, but I think I'll just do something moderate.
Oh, what a cool mom, Kiki
Are you going to make me do whatever I want?
Yeah, I want to give it a try at least!
It's good to foster a spirit of challenge at a young age.
Oh, and they say it's good for babies to take a bath with their dad.
Oh, I'm hearing this for the first time. What's so good about it?
I don't remember the details, but did you say that it helps you develop sociability? I think it was something like that.
Sociability is very important, you should know that Kiki
Oh, are you thinking of having a baby?
No, I just wanted to let you know ^^
I have to tell someone else
As expected, Kiki is a very determined person. Kiki
Kiki, I think you'll raise your child well even if I don't buy you a parenting dictionary later.
Oh Kiki, no, I want to study while watching Sajo haha
Okay, I'll buy you one later to raise it well.
Oh yeah, I'm not married yet, but I need to have a baby soon.
My aunt is opening a store soon
Wow, what kind of store is it? A restaurant?
No, it's a workshop, it's a place to make pottery.
Wow I wanted to try something like that
Let's go together later. It'll be fun.
How about giving each other gifts right away?
Oh good, that makes sense
Kiki, did your aunt originally do that?
No, you suddenly became interested and learned about it and then opened it. Kiki
Wow, it really is true that there is no age limit when it comes to learning... You are awesome ㅜ
Is there anyone in your family who is good with their hands?
Oh, my cousin is really good with his hands.
Oh, then what did your younger sibling make too?
No, my younger brother just likes to assemble plastic models as a hobby.
Oh, I wonder. I'll show you the pictures later when I go to my brother's house.
Okay, there's a lot on display, so look forward to it Kiki
Are there any men you're interested in these days?
I guess it's time to start dating, because everyone around me seems okay.
Hey hey no Kiki, you can't be that generous
Kiki I really don't know if my love exists
Hey, just like straw sandals have a pair, there will be someone
Please introduce me to a guy
Didn't you say you've never been introduced to anyone?
Yeah, I'm actually a little scared of being introduced, Kiki
But now it seems like it'll be hard to meet without a real introduction ㅜㅜ
So... I guess I need to change my thinking now.
Aren't there many men around you?
Well, there aren't many men among college students...
Catch one of them Kiki
I think I should catch one and marry him.
Kiki, if you have any good news, please let me know.
Then I'll let you know as soon as I catch it
How are you doing these days, Nari?
No, our Nari went to the hospital yesterday ㅜ
Oh, why? Where does it hurt?
Yeah, I went to the hospital because he suddenly stopped eating and started coughing...
What did the hospital say? Do you have a cold?
Yeah, the weather suddenly got cold so I caught a cold ㅠ
Oh... the weather is bad...
Ugh... So I got an IV and a prescription yesterday
What medicine do you give your cat?
There are pills and powder, but Nari should take the powder!
Oh, isn't it difficult to give powdered medicine?
Yeah, it's hard, but if you mix it with a snack, it's edible.
Ego Nari, you too are suffering...
I'm getting older so I'm worried about getting sick now ㅜ
I need to take better care of it in the future.
Yeah, I have to do really well for the rest of my life.
Do you like winter sports?
Yeah I like both skiing and snowboarding.
Oh, so you go skiing every year?
I used to go there often, but I couldn't go last year.
Are you definitely planning to go this year?
Yeah, I already made an appointment, Kiki.
I'm serious about Kiki Ski Resort.
It's better to go as soon as it opens because there won't be many people.
What should I ride this time?
I'm still worried ㅜ
What would be more fun to ride?
Which one do you like better?
Hmm... I like the board better haha
Oh, I've never been on a snowboard before.
I'll tell you
You teach better than I thought haha
Then, this time, go skiing with me too!
Yeah I'm fine catch me anytime Kiki
Recently, a game called Altubit came out again.
I know that game! I liked it
Kiki of the same generation
Are you good at Altubeet?
Well, I can do it Kiki
Oh, I'm curious?
Why did you like that game?
I liked it because I could play games and listen to music haha
I think I did it because I enjoyed listening to the song
When it comes out again, will the latest songs be updated?
Well, I'm not sure about that
It'd be more fun if the latest song came out haha
Old songs are nostalgic, but new songs are exciting.
When it re-releases, do you want to do it with me?
Okay, okay, I'll show off my skills
Let's see who's better
Okay, I guess it's probably pre-order time now.
Let's make a reservation in advance
Okay, I'm going to make a reservation right now Kiki
Winter is coming soon. Where do you want to travel?
I want to go to Jeju Island and see camellia flowers.
The camellia flowers on Jeju Island are pretty... Have you ever been there?
Yeah, I went there last year and it was really pretty.
Oh, I don't think I've ever been there in winter.
Maybe because it's in the south, the weather is definitely warm and nice!
If you go and take a picture, it will definitely be the picture of a lifetime, right?
Kiki, you took a lot of life shots last year
Are there any other good winter travel destinations?
Hmm... I think it would be better to go see the East Sea than I thought.
Wow, it must be really cold?
I thought my ears would fall off right away, but when I saw the ocean in the winter, my heart thumped haha
Where on the East Sea did you go?
I went to Sokcho and Jeongdongjin and saw the sunrise!
Oh, it would be so meaningful to see the sunrise in winter.
Even if I'm tired and exhausted in the morning, I feel good when I see the sunrise. Kiki
There's going to be a lot of rain in the east tomorrow.
Wow, it's the weekend and it's raining. People in the east must be upset.
It'll be really cold after that rain, right?
Yeah, I think so, the daily temperature difference will probably get worse too.
Oh right, the article said to be careful about the extreme daily temperature range.
Should I really wear padding now? It's still October.
The weather these days is really hopeless
But isn't it not that cold today?
Yeah, the weather was nice during the day today.
It would be nice weather if the wind didn't blow.
It's fall, but I don't think I'll be able to see the fall foliage.
Ah, I have to go to Seoraksan to see the fall foliage.
Do you often go see the fall foliage?
No, I can't go often, but I go to Gangwon-do to see it sometimes haha
Oh, where have you been?
I've been to Seoraksan and Odaesan.
These days, all the stocks are going green. What about you?
My stocks are all blue, so I'm depressed...
Oh my, you lost a lot?
Well, fortunately I didn't put in too much, so I didn't lose much...
Oh my, it's a shame even if I don't lose much ㅜ
That's why I don't use stock apps these days... Kiki
I was thinking about doing it when the stock market was booming, but I'm glad I didn't...
Never do it, even if people around you tell you to do it...
Yeah, my ears will never get thinner!
You have to be careful with coins these days too
Oh my friend put a ton of money into bitcoin and lost it all
Oh my... I know a friend's younger sibling borrowed a lot of money and lost it all, so the house was in chaos.
Oh my, if he's my younger sibling, he's still young...
So how did you get the loan...
Wow, the interest rate will be huge. This is a big deal.
Yeah, he said he tried to solve it himself but couldn't, so he told his parents...
There's a lot of talk about Samsung phones in Russia...
Huh? What's the problem?
It's currently in danger of being banned from sale!
What? What did I do wrong?
Samsung Electronics smartphones have been found to have used Swiss mobile payment service provider technology without permission...
Wow, is that really true?
The local court accepted the lawsuit...
Well... if it was accepted locally, then there's nothing we can do about it.
A hurricane-force storm swept across Europe for two days.
Oh my, I hope there were no casualties.
The article said 4 people died in Poland.
Oh my... This kind of story is really sad...
Oh, something unimaginable happened in India.
Hey, what happened in India!
A man in his 30s died after being hit by a brick thrown by a monkey.
Wow, this is the first time I've seen an article about a person dying from a rock thrown by a monkey...
It's been a while since I've been to the hair salon.
Is there a beauty salon you often go to?
Yeah, I moved to a new beauty salon last year, so I only go there.
Oh, that place must be doing well!
He cut my hair well and stroked it well haha
Are you always doing things that please me?
Yes, you know your customers' needs very well.
I want to go later too! Let me know.
Okay, I'll tell you when I go to the hair salon.
How do you take care of your skin?
These days, I'm just trying to use a pack about 3 times a week.
Oh, so you manage it with a mask pack?
Yeah, yeah, when I use a mask pack, my skin calms down and feels good the next day.
Do you know of any good products?
Well, rather than a product, I mainly use products that contain tea tree.
Oh tea tree... I have to memorize it, Kiki. Thank you.
Wow, today I ran 10km along the Han River for the first time in a long time.
Wow, how did you run 10 kilometers?
I got tired of running and ended up doing 10 kilometers. Kiki
You're really in good shape... How long did it take?
I think it took me an hour and thirty minutes at a leisurely pace.
Oh, you just ran to build up your stamina.
Yeah, but it was fun so I think I'll run a marathon next year.
Wow, it won't be easy to challenge the Kiki Marathon.
How about starting with 10km and working my way up to a half-full course?
Hey then your health will really get better Kiki
Right, Kiki, you're getting to the age where you need to take care of your health...
Maja... I should follow your example and take care of my health too.
How do you take care of yourself these days?
I just take care of myself by walking up the stairs or taking vitamins.
Still, I'm taking good care of it
If I don't do even this, my body will probably get mad at me Kiki
Where can I check the lowest price?
Aren't you typing it on Naver?
I know it's there too, but I searched for it separately
Then where do you search?
There's a site called enuri.com!
Does it come up if you search there?
Yes, just write the product name or product number.
This is really good. I'll take note.
Where do you usually order?
Ah, it's automatically logged in
How many of those do you usually have?
There are about three
What sites are these?
Coupang 11st Gmarket
Oh, which one is the best?
I love Coupang
Have you ever seen those delicious guys?
I often see this when I eat alone
Oh, you watch it while eating?
Yeah I see you often
I often see it in pictures too
Are you watching a drama?
I saw Jirisan that started yesterday
Who's there?
Joo Ji-hoon, Jeon Ji-hyun, etc!
Oh, the lineup is already awesome?
Yeah, acting is no joke
So what about the content?
Okay, okay, this is so much fun.
Which broadcasting station's drama is this?
I'm holding it in my arms because it's TVN
Oh, is that the 15th anniversary drama this time?
That's right, I know that too
Do you still watch Yumi's Cells often?
I'm also reading webtoons again
Wow, isn't that paid?
Yes, I am investing
Wow, I want to see it too, show me
I'll tell you my ID, so take that as an example
Wow, you're rich
I don't pay for webtoons coolly
Wow, that's amazing. I've never done this before...
Once you do it, you get addicted and keep doing it Kiki
Oh, then I'll be in trouble if I miss it
Yeah Kiki I often pay with Naver
Are there any other webtoons other than Naver?
There's also the next webtoon
Where is it easier to see?
I only see it on Naver
After all, cake is best when eaten whole!
Cake I like cheesecake
Kiki Oh really? I like chocolate cake the best!
Where do you like to buy things, sister?
I think it's different at each bakery though!
I like Starbucks cheesecake
Kiki and Starbucks, the Castella cake there seems to be really good!
Oh right, sister knows how to eat
Kiki Of course I can't drink coffee!
Oh, that's exactly like me
Kiki, really? Seriously, I won't be able to sleep that night even if I drink just one sip.
I can't drink coffee well either, so my heart pounds
Yeah Kiki, me too! We shouldn't drink coffee!
Oh, seriously, caffeine doesn't suit me
Yeah, that's why I always order dessert and hot chocolate at Starbucks!
Yeah, that's right. I also go to Starbucks and just drink ade.
Wow, I really hate hearing the sound of people fighting next door!
Oh, do you really fight every day?
Oh, I woke up to screaming this morning too
Oh, really, really, it must be hard because of the sound
ㅜㅜ That's right, my alarm is now useless.
Oh, that would be great
Hurry up ㅜㅜ No, bad things always happen first ㅜ
Oh, I really hate this
Kiki, right? This will be over in exactly two months!
Oh, so you decided to move now?
Oh! I'm going to go somewhere else now!
Oh, thank goodness I didn't hear that
Kiki, that's right, but what if I go again and it's worse than here?
Oh really, then you and your sister don't get along
Kiki I guess I just don't fit in with Seoul~
Oh, but I still want to live in Seoul
You have a car now!
Yeah right I'm full
Oh, you bought that with full options?
Yeah, I bought it with full options.
Wow, that's crazy, how much would it cost to get full options on a foreign car!?
Yeah, that's how you can seduce women.
Kiki Oki So you pick up a lot of girls with that car?
Yeah, so my girlfriend likes me now.
Kiki, wow, daebak Kiki, when you say a foreign car is full option, what usually comes with it?
Um just the sheet and the light
Light? What was that called?
I don't remember
Yeah, I don't remember very well either
So are you satisfied with your car now?
No, I want to change to another car and save up money
Kiki, wake up!
You should ride that for at least 10 years!
Kiki, I guess I'm still immature
Did you ever work part-time when you were in high school?
Yeah, I did a lot of part-time jobs when I was in high school.
Kiki Oh really? But are there a lot of places to do in Nonsan?
There are just cafes and bars
Hey, sir, how do you go to a bar when you're in high school?
Oh, I did that when I was an adult, when I was in college.
Kiki, that's the place you worked part-time when you were exactly 20 years old, right?
Yeah, of course I did it when I was 20.
Yeah, I remember you being super busy!
Yeah, that's right, it was really hard
Kiki, that's right, it wasn't even Kosic back then, so there were a lot of people!
Yeah, it was really hard, you guys
Kiki, was there a truth there too?
How old were the guests there?
Yeah, they were the same age as me.
Kiki, but I'm going to use my power on you!?
Yeah, I got drunk and acted like a fool. It was hard.
Did you buy Locati from PX too?
Yeah, I bought it too. You know that too, sis.
Kiki, I know, Kiki. Do you know that that's a must-have item for middle school kids these days?
Oh seriously, I don't even want to look at it
Kiki, that's right, all military veterans think like this, but Jammins don't think like that Kiki
I want to forget about the military, sister
Kiki But you don't have any civil defense left now, do you?
Sister, I had such a hard time, but I had to do that too
Kiki, just hold on until you're 30~
After that, there is liberation~
Yeah, you have to endure it because everyone else is doing it too.
Yeah Kiki, just hold on for a bit~
But the unit won't go back~
Yeah, I feel strong because of you, Kiki. Thank you for the kind words.
Kiki Oh, it's such an honor to be of help to you~
Wow, really, what you said is encouraging
Kiki, now you just have to walk on a flower path~
Thanks to you, I'm walking on a flower path
Did you have a teacher you hated when you were a student?
Yeah, I hated my English teacher.
Oh really? Because you hate English itself?
Yeah, I'm really bad at English
Kiki, did your English teacher scold you for not being able to speak English?
Yeah, my English teacher forbade me to eat.
Oh my gosh, that's not it!
You have to eat lunch!
Kiki, I had to memorize all the English words before I sent it to you.
Wow, so if I can't memorize everything, I really can't eat?
No, I can eat it, but please send it late.
But if you go late, there will be a lot of delicious food left so you can get a lot of it Kiki
No, my friends all took it so there's not much left
Aaaah Kiki, our school should have gone later, they gave us more!
It must have been different there!
Oh really, if we go early, we get a lot more
Kiki, I see. How many times a week did you do that?
Yeah, almost every day? I'm hungry now that you mention it...
You said you have two older brothers and one younger sister, right?
Yeah, that's right, I have a lot of brothers
Did your parents plan everything for you? Kiki
Oh, I don't know about that because I didn't ask.
Kiki: But raising 4 people is really hard!
Yeah, I'm so grateful to Mom and Dad.
Kiki, right? Your parents said that abstaining from alcohol is good, right?
Yeah, my parents are happy
Kiki Oh, daebak Kiki, you'll be happier if you have lots of kids!
Yeah, right. We have to be filial every day.
Then don't your brothers fight often?
Yeah we don't fight often, just occasionally
Kiki's little sister is also an adult now?
Yeah, they're all adults haha
Kiki: I see. How old is your sister now?
My sister is a 23 year old kid
Did you say you have a girlfriend now?
Yeah I have a girlfriend now
How old were you when you met your current girlfriend?
I found out about my girlfriend a year ago
I see. You must have just been discharged from the military when you met?
Yeah, I met you after I was discharged from the military. You're pretty.
Did you meet Kiki after she returned to college?
No, she's just a friend of my older sister's
Oh really? Then you're older?
Yeah, I'm older than you
I followed you because you were pretty
Kiki and Daebak Kiki, how did you meet?
I was drinking and he sat next to me and I fell in love with him.
Kiki, wow, awesome Kiki. But I guess your girlfriend liked you from the start~
Oh, that's right. He pinched my cheek.
Kiki, wow, awesome~ That's where the sparks flew~
Yeah, I think so
I miss you already
You have no intention of living alone right now, do you?
Yeah, I don't want to live alone, I'm a debtor.
If you ever become independent, is there an animal you would like to raise?
Yeah, I want to raise a puppy.
Right? You seem to really like puppies!
Yeah, I go to dog cafes often.
Kiki, really? Are you going to a dog cafe with your friends?
Yeah, go with your friends or go with your dad
Kiki, does your dad like you too?
So, your mother doesn't like it so you can't raise a dog?
Dad likes dog cafes too
I love puppies so much my mom hates them
Oh my, Kiki, did you go to a dog cafe recently?
Yeah, I went recently.
Does your sister like puppies?
Kiki I really love animals!
Oh, I think so
I think my sister is also sensitive
Kiki, no, it's not that they're young, they're just so cute ㅜㅜ
Oh really? Kiki is right, she's really cute
Have you ever joined a sports club?
I joined the bowling club.
Oh really? Is there such a thing as a bowling club?
I joined because I like bowling.
Oh, how many bowling games do you have?
Yeah I got 200 points ㅠㅠ haha
Wow, 200 points?
Aren't you a player?
But I can't hit it
Other people hit better
Kiki, have those people ever competed?
Wow, he's really at the level of a professional.
Wow, how many points does a great Kiki player usually get?
Everyone is a 360 point pro
I want to do that too
Wow, is that a score of 360 in bowling?
Wow, you're really crazy, Kiki, you're good at hitting
Kiki, this is awesome! This is the first time I've heard of 360 points!
I saw it for the first time too. I saw it at the competition.
What do you usually do when you meet your friends?
I get all worked up when I meet the kids
Kiki Halli Galli? Aren't you guys too cute?
Yeah, we're missing our fortress.
Kiki, but did you know that Halli Galli also makes blood boil?
Let's bet our money on Halli Galli Kiki 50,000 won
Kiki Wow, wow, who usually plays games?
Fifty thousand won per person for all of us
Kiki Huh? Then can I join you too?
Do you want to join us, sis? Let's make money.
Kiki, so I'm really good at Halli Galli
I'm really good. Can we be comfortable together?
Kiki Oh, can we do it as a team battle?
Yeah, it's a one-on-one match, but it's a team match
Kiki, are we doing a backroom deal?
Yeah Kiki sounds fun
Let's meet up and do it together
Aren't you going on a trip for Christmas?
I went skiing with my girlfriend on Christmas
Kiki wow I'm so jealous ㅜㅜ
Where are you going?
Have you been to Muju Nuna Ski Resort?
No, I've never been to Muju!
Ah, it's really close to Muju
Is Muju close to Nonsan?
How many hours does it take?
It's far, I think it takes about 2 hours
I've only been to Yongsan!
Oh, really, Yongsan is far, but Nonsan is too far.
But I think it would be closer to Mujugo than Yongsan!
Yeah, so I'm going to go this time with my girlfriend.
Kiki wow awesome ㅜㅜ I'm jealous ㅜㅜ
I also want to go skiing for the first time in a long time!
That would be fun
It would be nice if my sister went too
My boyfriend Delgo
Kiki, is that so?
But my boyfriend doesn't like it cold!
It would be nice if we went on a double date together
What was the coldest day this week?
Didn't you say it was cold and rainy two days ago this week?
Oh, is that so?
It rained here on Monday, didn't it?
Ah, it seems like it got colder here after the rain...
Kiki, that's right. It rained here on Monday night and was freezing cold on Tuesday!
Ah, I really hate it when it gets cold ㅠㅠ
Kiki I really don't know where fall went!
Oh, I really love fall
Right, but will it stay cold like this forever?
I think it's going to get colder
It's going to snow, big deal
Oh my gosh ㅜㅜ If it snows, this place will look like trash?
I think it'll be really cold if it really snows
Don't throw trash
Yes Kiki and Seoul really didn't lie, it wasn't snow but something gray
Oh seriously, have you never made a snowman before, Kiki?
Kiki: If you want to build a snowman here, maybe you should go to the park?
Ah Kiki, I made a lot of snowmen though.
Do you have tens of millions of won in your bank account right now?
I only have 10 million won ㅠㅠ
Kiki, where was that? Do you remember the Nonghyup incident back then?
Oh, really, how much do you have, sister?
What happened
At that time, there was an incident where someone lost 200 million won due to a mistake in transfer from Nonghyup!
Oh, this is really awesome
Tell me what it is about
But the victim appeared on TV because he said he couldn't compensate for that?
Oh, is it really two hundred million?
Wow how ㅠㅠ If I were you, I'd be really pissed
ㅜㅜ By the way, I happened to see an article this time?
Yeah but I wonder what that is
How much of the money you put in your bank account do you think will be protected!?
Still, wouldn't it be around five million won?
This is different for each financial product, but if you put in about 200 million won, it's about 80 million won?
Oh, so that's all you can do?
ㅜㅜ Everything will fly away
But I don't know because the amount set for each financial product is different!
Oh, it's really amazing, I just found out about it
Wow, there was a controversy over Chinese kimchi earlier this year, and now it's red pepper powder!
Oh really Chinese kimchi? Kiki
What is that? Oh, red pepper powder
Kiki, step on the pepper powder with your bare feet again and sell it!
Oh my god, this is so gross... Kiki yuck
Kiki, that's why this video came out and it's a mess!
Mom... I'm really curious about the video too
But the girl kept stepping on it as if she was really used to it
Oh, that's not it. Why is China like that?
Kiki: That's right, they even sell fake eggs here!
Ah, long live the Republic of Korea! China really can't survive.
Kiki: Right, but that's part of it, right?
I wish it were so,
Well, it's really bad
We also say that excessive packaging of snacks is really bad.
Compared to China, it's a three-legged race!
Yeah, I admit that, I eat it all the time...
That's right Kiki, I think the answer is to just not use Chinese products!
Yeah, I don't really go to restaurants that serve Chinese food.
Do you have any tattoos on your body now?
Yeah, I have a tattoo on my back.
Wow, awesome Kiki, that's right, I think you said you drew it back then!
I have a tattoo on my chest too haha
I did it with style
Wow, daebak Kiki, when did you get breasts again!?
I did it this time, men's romance
Kiki, where did you go and do that~
I went to Daejeon and got it from a friend I know.
Kiki, really? How much did you pay for that?
This chest cost 2 million won haha it's expensive
Wow Kiki, the amount is great, but doesn't it hurt when you do it?
Yeah, it hurts, but I forgot about it now
Hey Kiki, you really don't plan on deleting it, do you?
Yeah, I did it without thinking about erasing it.
Kiki and daebak,
How long did it take you to do that?
Time almost five hours? Slowly
I ate cake on an empty stomach and now I feel sick ㅜ
Ah, I'm hungry. I just want to eat.
It's time to eat dinner now ㅜ
Yeah, don't eat cake. I don't like it.
Kiki, but there's still half of the cake left, right?
Oh really, give that to me and eat something else
Good for your health
Kiki ha, this has an expiration date too, it's a shame
Don't be stingy and take care of your health!
Kiki, I've already eaten half of it~
I'm already feeling unwell~
Ah, seriously, take your vitamins considering your age
Kiki Ah, of course I'm taking vitamins~
Oh seriously, please recommend me something
Kiki I'm just eating what Yoo Jae-seok is promoting~
Oh really, I want to eat that too
It's definitely a vitamin with great value for money!
Ah, I have to eat well too. I'm tired.
You didn't take out any other loans besides the car, did you?
Yeah, if I take out a loan I'm in big trouble.
ㅠㅠ I can't
That's right, Kiki, you should never accept it!
But if I take out a loan, won't my credit drop?
Yeah, we should stop here Kiki, no, don't fall
Kiki Oh really? My friend said his rating dropped to 6th place as soon as he got the loan!
Oh really I didn't do that, I should check
Yeah? What rank were you originally?
Am I second class?
I don't remember what happened
I'm also level 2 now?
How do you get a first grade?
So I don't really understand what I'm saying ㅠㅠ
Kiki Me too, I should just keep applying for housing subscriptions~
I also want to receive a contract for an apartment through a housing subscription.
Kiki Oh, I hope you win the housing subscription in two years and move into a nice apartment!
I really dream of that too please
Kiki Me too, but I don't have money, do I?
Let's fight together
Do you like YouTube?
Are you watching?
Yeah, I see you all the time! Look at me carefully!
It's been a long time since I've seen a dance and I laughed so hard!
Ah seriously, I really like Cheon-ttung Kiki
Kiki, didn't Cheon-tung appear in that prequel?
Yeah, that's right, the person who appears in the pre-show
Oh right, but that person opened a YouTube channel!
Yeah right, it's really funny
Kiki, did you see what I uploaded this time?
Yeah, I tried that
Did you see it too, sister?
Kiki, of course
The sora-muchim noodles must have been really tasty!
You really enjoyed it so much
Makes me want to eat...
Kiki is right ㅜㅜ I really don't like Sora
Looking at that makes me want to eat some sora!
I really like Sora ㅠ
Kiki, really? You must have wanted to eat more!
Yeah, let's eat together later
Is there a movie or cartoon you enjoyed the most recently?
I really enjoyed watching Parasite
Ah, Parasite, I think I've seen that three times!
Oh yeah Parasite was really fun
But I couldn't watch the scene where Choi Woo-shik hits her with a rock until the end.
Yeah, that's right, Choi Woo-shik is really scary... He's cruel...
That's right ㅜㅜ And the scene where Park So-dam gets stabbed by a knife too!
Park So Dam is really charming
He's my ideal type, but I'm scared
Yeah ㅜㅜ That's why it was an open ending
What do you think happened?
Yeah, I think they all just died...;
Well, I guess my dad is the only one living there like a parasite!
Ah, what you said seems right...
Kiki, right? Is there going to be a Parasite 2?
I really hope it comes out, it'll be fun
Kiki is right but we got something
It's the Chaekkeutsal Jjabaguri!
Yeah Kiki I eat that every day looking at it
What is your favorite food, oppa?
I like Korean food like this Kiki
Oh, right, Kiki
On a day like today, I'm so happy~
Kiki, I ate kimchi stew today~
Kiki and Kimchi Stew
I had kimchi stew yesterday~
Oh wow, my house had kimchi stew yesterday too. Kiki
Wow, awesome, bro. But you ate kimchi again today~?
that's right...
When I hear this, I feel like I only eat kimchi every day ㅠ
Kiki but I also ate kimchi pancake today
Oh, kimchi pancake? That sounds good~
But I like seafood pancake better Kiki
Kiki A admits
But I like seafood kimchi pancake the best
Yeah I like seafood Kiki
It has to have seafood in it to be a jeon
Kiki, of course, among the seafood, squid has to be included!
Oh, mung bean pancakes are delicious too, Kiki
Do you like that?
Kiki hull mung bean pancake,
But I like mung bean samgyetang better Kiki
Oh, that's delicious too
There's a good restaurant here
Are you planning on moving now, oppa?
no
I don't have any plans to move yet ㅠㅠ
Kiki I want to go out but I don't have money
Kiki I want to do some interior design stuff
Kiki ah admit kiki
Oppa, then overall, the house isn't bad, right?
Yeah, my house is fine for me to just stay there by myself.
I envy Kiki,
There's so much I don't like!
I don't like anything here either Kiki
Kiki, I see
Oppa, where do you live now?
I currently live in Daejeon Kiki
Kiki, didn't you say Jeonju last time?
What are you talking about, Kiki?
I'm in Daejeon, why is this happening?
Kiki, huh? Didn't you say that it was your first week of work?
no
Who is Jeonju?
Why are you confused
Kiki, where is your first job!?
This isn't my first job week Kiki
How is your company doing these days, oppa?
I'm driving my car right now Kiki
Kiki, I see
When are you buying tea, oppa?
I've been living in the mountains for a long time Kiki
I think it's been over 5 years
Oh, right, Kiki
Oppa, is your car still running smoothly these days?
Yeah, it's going well
The condition isn't bad, Kiki
Kiki, why does my car keep making a noise?
That's because you met a bad owner, Kiki.
Kiki ha, I'm really pissed
It discharges as soon as you bring it,
Huh? The battery died as soon as you brought it home?
Oh, I'm really pissed off,
Well, it's been 4 years since then,
Ah, then maybe it's time to let go Kiki
Kiki ha, no,
I'm going to ride it for 10 more years!
Kiki I think girls always ride until they die Kiki
Kiki is right
I just got sick and fell in love with it ㅜ
right
They say that people are very attached to their first car.
What on earth does your brother do at work?
Aren't you the boss who's scolding me right now?
Kiki no
I'm just asking?
no
What are you doing! I think you're scolding me like this, Kiki
Kiki no, I'm just really genuinely curious~
Ah, I'm on the scene so it's hard to explain this, but Kiki
Kiki, it's the scene ㅜㅜ
Is it hard there!?
It's really cold these days, so it's hard to work Kiki
Black mud ㅜㅜ That's right
Autumn disappeared in an instant!
It's winter now!
Oh, so I don't feel like working right now
Kiki, ㅜㅜ When winter comes, won't your income decrease?
That's right
So I hate it when it's cold Kiki
Kiki admits
I really hate it too
The air conditioner must be in front of me
? Isn't that cold, Kiki?
I'm a heater... heh
Kiki, aren't air conditioners and heaters a jumble these days?
Kiki, it works well with air conditioning
Oppa, was jjamppong tasty when you were in the army?
Wow, this is really delicious, Kiki
I'm happy when I eat
Haha really?
There was a fuss about giving rotten eggs this time, right?
This time?
But that's how the military is, Kiki
But wasn't there anything like this when you were a kid?
When there is an avian flu epidemic, we only see chickens
Kiki and Crazy
Is that swine fever? If you have that, they say you can get boiled pork.
that's right
In the military, they bring things that don't sell and make beer.
Kiki, wow, awesome Kiki. But oppa, is Gunderia really that good?
Oh, how delicious that is!
Kiki Oppa, then do you eat the Gunderia from Lotte?
no
I didn't eat that Kiki
Kiki: Then did you think of Gunderia after you came out?
But there are so many delicious things to eat that I don't really need military food...
Kiki ah oki kiki
I was watching YouTube and there was a person wearing a military uniform and eating that. He was a civilian.
There's a lot to eat, but I don't know why you eat that, Kiki
Oppa, where did you go to school in middle school?
I just went to a Korean, English, and math academy. Kiki
Haha I don't study at all either
So you study the rest at the academy?
Kiki a creepy
Oh, if you don't do your homework,
And after the test, he makes you study a lot for the rest Kiki
Kiki ha, really, and do you remember getting beaten up at school?
Oh, then we were all punished at school too Kiki
Kiki, right?
Oh man, it really hurts but I never do my homework hahaha
Kiki I'm doing my homework but I'm not doing well on the test.
Oh really?
We value homework more than tests.
No, it's sad that I can't take the test, but
Kiki A admits
But I was always in the 3rd class among the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd class.
Of course, the worst room~
Wow I always get B on ABC
Kiki, you did the middle part though?
I'm just an idiot Kiki
That too has to be innate
Look at me, I'm smart
How many people are there in your family?
There are five of us in total.
Kiki, me too~
Oh, then your parents, your older brother, and one older sister?
no
Two older sisters~
It's five, it's five ㅠㅠ
Ahh okie okie kiki
My brother was the youngest, right~
Oh, I have two older sisters ㅠㅠ
How many times do I have to say this, Kiki?
Kiki Oki sorry sorry
But I don't know the age~
There's a big age difference between us~
Kiki is right
I think that's what I said!
Oh, so sometimes it's a little awkward because we're Kiki's family.
Kiki, why did you raise me while carrying me?
No
My sister didn't raise me Kiki
Kiki? Really?
Aren't you and your older sister 10 years apart?
no
Kiki, 5 and 7 years old
Kiki, not until 10 years old
But if you were 7 years old, you would have probably raised your brother!
Well, my older sister also likes to go out and play, so Kiki
When are you getting married, oppa!?
I don't have any big plans yet ㅠㅠ
I see
Oppa, you have a girlfriend now!
Aren't you getting married?
It's been a long time since we broke up
Kiki can't get married
Sorry Kiki
Oh, how did we break up~
It's just that something doesn't fit
I don't want to think about it Kiki
Oppa got a car~? Kiki, err ...
Kiki, you called your ex-boyfriend crying.
Kiki, why are you talking about that here?
Kiki, you were the one who teased me first ㅠㅠ
Kiki Miyan Kiki
Why don't we make up?
Kiki yeah
I still feel the pain of separation Kiki
Kiki, no, we broke up a long time ago
Are you still drawing?
I don't know
I think I couldn't meet a girl because I was so bad back then Kiki
Kiki, ugh, ugh~ If you have any thoughts, tell me later
There are a lot of my friends who are really nice~
okay
Please make me stand in line and choose.
Does your brother have any pets?
Yeah, I'll have a cat come in a week later Kiki
Wow, awesome Kiki Nyangisu~
Where did you bring me the angel?
This is an angel that my friend is giving away~
How many months has it been since you were born, Hall Kiki?
I think it's been 3 months now, Kiki
Wow, you're the child born in the Sorum Kiki household?
that's right
Kiki was born to a family of cats and dogs
Kiki, wow, so you're a kid with both a mom and a dad?
Oh, if I take Kiki with me later, I'll find out
Kiki, wouldn't you know by smell?
I don't know if you'll remember even after so long, Kiki
No, it's Kiki
They say that children remember things because their sense of smell is highly developed!
Oh really?
I wonder if puppies will recognize each other if they see each other for the first time in a while.
Yeah Kiki
He said he recognized both cats and dogs~
I miss you so much and I miss you Kiki
I wonder
Hey Helchang, what kind of exercise are you doing these days?
Today I'm sitting down and standing up repeatedly~
Oh, so you're doing squats~
Yeah Kiki
Now I feel like I'm getting exercise
Kiki admits
I've been working out lately too~
Oh, what kind of exercise are you doing now?
Kiki I don't know if you know what kegel exercise is~
Hey, why are you doing that, Kiki?
Kiki, this is a good exercise for girls!
Where is that good exercise?
Kiki, is this it?
Good exercise for buttocks
Oh really? Looks like you're trying to do hip-up, Kiki
Kiki, I'm a duck butt ㅜ
I have to do it
Kiki, right? Women really do a lot of hip-up exercises.
that's right
Women must do it unconditionally
Otherwise, it won't look good if you wear pants that are too tight
I should tell my sisters to do it too Kiki
Bro, what game are you playing right now?
I'm playing Go-Stop right now Kiki
True story? Kiki
Who are you with now?
No, I'm on mobile, Kiki
Online Friends
Kiki and Goosebumps, how much money did you earn?
I just earned about 10 million won yesterday and today
Kiki and Crazy
Oppa, did you do it there?
no
I don't do it
Ham Kiki with big stakes
But how do you win?
All of those are free to use
Then the person I met might be a non-paying person Kiki
It's not Kiki
Will you make that user a paid user!?
Ah, I was trying to make you lose on purpose, but it's too much
Kiki, that's right
That's why my dad put in 100 million, Kiki
Wow, Father, 100 million there?
Oh Kiki, of course not real money but game money~
Aha, but how do I invest 100 million?
Kiki with game money
Honey, do you have any travel plans?
Well, I'm going to try traveling around the country this time.
Kiki, but I can't go abroad right now anyway~
that's right
But it's still there even though it's loose, Kiki
Kiki, but if you go, I can't guarantee you won't get corona~
So I wanted to feel the value of my country, so I went to Kiki.
Kiki admits
I heard there are a lot of campers these days. Are you planning to go camping too?
no
I don't like being cold outside Kiki
Kiki, I'm like that too, but my friends kept asking me to go, so I'm going~
But if you go, it'll be fun again Kiki
Kiki Of course~
I'm having the most fun~
What do you usually do when you go to school Kiki?
I have to keep eating with the kids now
We decided to eat 5 meals
Wow, I think I'll eat and clean up and eat and clean up and come back. Kiki
Kiki, that's right
I decided to continue the dishwashing game
Kiki can't sleep
Wow, Kiki, do the dishes
That would be a real thing too
It was really hot in Nonsan today~
Oh really?
The weather in Daejeon is nice too Kiki
Kiki, really?
Seoul continued to be gloomy
Seoul, why are you like that there, Kiki?
It's not raining?
Kiki, if it rains again today, the Earth will really be ruined!
Now when it rains, won't it turn into snow and fall? Kiki
Kiki I don't know
If it snows this season, I'll really cry ㅜ
Kiki It's still a little early for it to snow Kiki
Yeah, it's really early!
And I absolutely hate the cold!
that's right
I really don't like the cold either, Kiki
Kiki is right
But I like being home when it snows
Oh and Kiki, the one drinking coffee while looking outside
Kiki is right
I can't drink coffee, so I'll just lie down somewhere warm and eat tangerines~
Ah, it's time to buy some tangerines, Kiki.
Kiki is right
I bought a box this time~
Hey, I should go tangerine shopping too, Kiki
Honey, are you fully vaccinated now?
Yeah I finished all 2nd one Kiki
Oppa, but you don't get the flu?
Oh, I still have the flu
you?
Kiki I didn't get any of that at all!
Even if Kiki's vaccine is like that, it doesn't protect against the flu either?
Kiki, you know what?
Can you die from getting a flu shot?
Hey, doesn't the flu hit people every year?
Kiki, but it's not like the article says you can die from a flu shot!
Oh, I didn't know that at all, Kiki
I don't want to die from a flu shot ㅠㅠ
So, there was an article that asked if it was necessary to get vaccinated against coronavirus and the flu since their symptoms are the same!
Oh, right
If you have coronavirus, is there a reason to take care of the flu as well?
Kiki That's right, but I know a friend who went to the hospital and got a flu shot already.
Ah, my friends who go to the hospital all seem to agree, Kiki
that's right
That older sister said she groaned about 3 times
Kiki's flu
Ah, I guess you're sick even if you have the flu, Kiki
I don't like it ㅠㅠ
Bro, are you interested in Bitcoin?
Oh I did that Kiki
Kiki Goosebumps Then you know that, is it Shiba Coin?
Oh, I think I heard that before, Kiki
Oh, this just broke the record, Kiki
How much has it gone up now?
Hey, just wait, I'll go check it out!
Hey, come and see it now, Kiki
How much is 68,320 dollars in our currency?
Oh, can't you come and do the math for me too? Kiki
I don't know Kiki
60 thousand dollars is 7 million won?
Could it be more than that?
Is that so
But do you know why Shibacoin is popular?
Why did that suddenly go up?
What company was it...
no
Shiba Inu is just cute
Because the name is cute,
Wow, that can't be true...
That can't be right...
Oppa, didn't you bleach your hair when you were in high school?
no
I've never bleached my hair Kiki
I see
Oppa, have you only ever had your hair permed?
no
I always shave my head Kiki
Kiki, are you still upset about that?
Not that much, Kiki
Kiki doesn't have long hair
Oppa, didn't you say last time that you had M-shaped hair loss?
no
Not to that extent yet...
Kiki, oppa, are you using a shampoo specifically for hair loss right now?
Oh right Kiki
There are a lot of good ones these days too
Kiki, you're not at the level where you need to take medicine yet, are you?
It's not that bad, I think just using shampoo would be fine Kiki
Kiki, I see
That's fortunate
I know a good hair wig shop, contact me~
Hey, are you telling me to lose my hair right now, Kiki?
Kiki no
Then, you should go to a good hospital and get it implanted!
no
I'm going to become rich naturally Kiki
Oppa, how's your health these days?
There's no place that doesn't hurt these days, Kiki
Kiki Oppa, you work in the field, so you must have basic physical strength!
That's true
But that's not exercise Kiki
Kiki: So you don't plan on exercising?!
I can't exercise because I use up too much energy while working, Kiki
Kiki, I see
Oppa, then eat something good!
Yeah, you always take good nutritional supplements, right?
Kiki Of course I'm eating
I'm even drinking black garlic extract!
Wow, isn't that something adults eat, Kiki?
No, it's Kiki
Oppa, eat this too! This is good for men!
That doesn't look tasty, Kiki
No, it's Kiki
Sweeter than I thought~
Then give it to me, Kiki
I'll eat and think about it
Kiki, you're too far away to give this to me,
No no
I'm coming down now, so bring one with me when you come down.
My brother has reached the level of a god in second-hand trading?
Me? Why did the rumor spread to that place, Kiki?
Kiki then then~
Oppa, this is no joke in Naver Cafe!
Kiki is right
I'm getting rid of a lot of machines
As expected, men sell a lot of things like computer equipment~
Oh right
Kiki, I'm selling the one I used while buying a new one
Kiki That's why women don't even think about selling things like computer parts.
I don't know, Kiki
Only people who are interested do it, Kiki
Kiki Hugh yeah
My brother also earned 20 with that
What did your brother sell? Kiki
What's our brother's REM? Hard disk?
I said I sold that kind of thing!
Oh, but that needs to be done by someone who knows how to assemble it Kiki
Kiki, my brother is working in Haiti~
Of course you'll do well~
Easy to assemble and disassemble~
Oh, then I guess I'll have to ask for an assembled body next time Kiki
Kiki, just keep talking~
But I don't know if we'll ever have a chance to go to Daejeon~
No, I should visit that place! Kiki
Who is your favorite celebrity these days?
What kind of celebrity are you? What~ What~ What~
Likes ~ Dislikes ~ Women Men Celebrities ~
I don't really like celebrities or anything these days.
Kiki you
okay?
There's an actor I fell in love with this time~
Oh, who did you fall for this time, Kiki?
Kiki and Park Hwi-soon are really amazing!
Oh, what's your name?
Did you see that? Kiki
Oh Kiki, I fell in love with Park Hwi-soon ㅜ
that's right
That dog was cool
Kiki, you smoke cigarettes really cool
Kiki is right
What is that cigarette?
It feels like it's on a whole other level compared to other cigarettes!
How can you be so cool while smoking while riding in a car? What kind of Kiki is that?
Wow, Kiki is right
But at first glance, it looked like expensive cigarettes!
So I wanted to buy a lighter too, Dupont~!
Kiki du Pont~! Look carefully to see if there's a recorder installed there~
Hey you don't need to install it on mine Kiki
Have you ever been to a drive-in theater, oppa?
Oh, I've been there once or twice, Kiki
I've been there and back a lot~?
Have you ever been in a car rental?
Huh? Car rental?
Is this true? Kiki
Kiki I've never been there either, but I was wondering if you have any experience. Kiki
No Kiki
I can't do it because I'm scared. I think a ghost will appear behind the magnet. Kiki
Ghost Kiki
No, go watch it while eating chicken alone.
It's not Kiki
It's getting colder later, it's scary ㅜ
No
Kiki, I can't stand the warmth of chicken
Kiki Chicken is a good choice
It would be awesome to watch an action movie while eating chicken!
You like action genre? Kiki
of course
I'm totally into action~
What kind of action movies do you like? Kiki
I enjoyed watching Venom that came out this time~
Ah, so you see that as action too? I thought it was fantasy Kiki
Oppa, do you have lunch at work?
Yeah I'm coming out of the lunch company Kiki
Oh really?
What's out today!
Today we went out and bought some Kiki
Why do they provide lunch at the company?
Yeah, but sometimes I want to go out and eat Kiki
Kiki, that's right
But today is Monday and you ate out from the start?
Yeah, I don't like eating at work from Monday. I'm Kiki.
Kiki ah admit kiki
So what are you eating today~?
Today I ordered and ate Chadol Jjamppong Kiki
Wow, Chadol Jjamppong, and you even ordered fried dumplings with it?
no
But I couldn't order that much because I was using a corporate card.
Kiki Aogane How much can you spend with the law card?
It's 8,000 won per person, but we eat 10,000 won worth of food.
Wow, awesome Kiki! I'm going to be called in by the boss tomorrow!
no
I don't know yet, sir. I'm on credit.
Oppa, you said you live alone now, right?
Oh, I'm living alone right now, Kiki
that's right
How long have you been living alone, Oppa?
I think I've been living alone for about 5 years now Kiki
Oh really?
It's been longer than I thought?
Why did you come out?
Kiki, it just came out naturally while I was working
I came up to Seoul this time too!
I'm moving now!
that's right
You're in Seoul
Where are you moving to Kiki?
I'm going to Pyeongtaek now!
Are you not coming to Nonsan and going to Pyeongtaek?
Yeah, I'm going to my boyfriend's side!
Oh my gosh, you're getting married soon, Kiki
no
Don't have money?
First, I need to get money~
Ah, that's a recognition, you have to work hard to earn money Kiki
So shouldn't we each earn 100 million won and think about it?
Wow, 100 million Kiki
I just don't want to date
It was really hot in the subway today!
today?
It wasn't that cold today, Kiki
Kiki no
It was cold outside, but I think it was because of the warmth of the people.
no
I guess the subway heater is on now Kiki
Kiki, is that so?
It was so hot that I was sweating~
Underarm sweat Why do you always sweat under your arms?
Kiki, I don't have any hair on my armpits so it flows well~
Oh, is that because women don't have hair?
Kiki, that's right
And I have a secret~
You? What secret is hidden in your sweat, Kiki?
I had laser treatment on my armpits~
Hey, I heard that all kids do that these days Kiki
What's your secret, Kiki?
Yeah Kiki
Damn, I wore a fur coat today and I thought I was going to die on the subway!
No, if you were next to me, it would smell terrible Kiki
It's not Kiki~
I don't smell at all~
no
It's so cool, try it now
Are you going to change jobs now, oppa?
Hey, they aren't giving me my salary right now.
Kiki, wow, awesome! You can't miss out on your salary!
So, I haven't received my deposit for several weeks now.
Oh my, is your company on the verge of bankruptcy?
That's not it
Kiki, I guess you're spending your money somewhere else
Hey, but you still have to take care of your employees' money and use it!
So that's why I'm just going to move it~
Kiki Of course
It's right to abandon a company with such a rotten mindset!
that's right
Is your company okay?
We really don't lie, money comes in just like AI Kiki
That company is the best company Kiki
Yeah Kiki
That's why I like our company more and more!
Then I guess I'll just have to do it plainly there Kiki
no
I don't think so, we're just in the process of figuring it out~?
Ah, you're still getting to know the company, Kiki
You said you had a younger brother, right?
Oh, I have a younger brother, Kiki
Did that punk become wise after going to the military?
no
Why do dogs stay the same no matter how old they get?
Kiki Ah, then I'm done~
Oh no~
Why did you say that my brother was wrong?
Kiki, you know best, right?
But do you think I know what I'm talking about?
Kiki knows
How long has it been since your younger brother was discharged from the military?
I think it's been about two years since the dog came out
Kiki: Then what are you going to do now that you're out there?
I'm studying and preparing for a job right now Kiki
But you're still preparing for a job, you idiot~
then
We have to eat to live. We're not rich.
Kiki's so funny Kiki, just tell them to just drive a stake in!
Oh, I recommended that too, but this one is not it lol
Oppa, how many certificates do you have now?
I currently have 0 certifications!
Hey, don't lie.
But how do you get into the company?
Why can't I go to work without a license?
But usually, they don't pick people without specs!
No
I'm a new employee at a company and I'm learning while I'm working!
Oh, oppa, you saw the blind interview?
no
No, but I'm handsome
Kiki, but what does being good-looking have to do with your company?
Kiki, the beggar who was chosen because he liked her face
Is that the boss there? Kiki who reveals the man
Oh, but you didn't say no, thank you ^^
Kiki, I feel bad for your girlfriend!
I'll do it all!
no
My girlfriend is meeting me after seeing my face Kiki
Are you sure?
Looking at your personality, I'd think you'd run away.
Oh no
Even if I'm angry, I can't calm down when I see your face
Is your father doing well at work these days?
Hey, dad, you're working hard right now.
You said you were sick last time. Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm feeling better now and I'm doing well~
That's a relief ㅜㅜ
Are you still taking your medicine?
Oh, you always try not to eat, so I pack it for you Kiki
Oh my gosh ㅜㅜ What time do you start work?
Dad, I have to leave for work at 5:00 ㅠㅠ It's early...
So that's why you always hear snoring around you when you're talking to your brother?
that's right
So go to bed early Kiki New World Children
Kiki, I see
What time do you get off work?
I think Dad gets off work around 4 o'clock Kiki
I see
So you eat dinner at 5 and go to bed at 7?
no
Not that much, 7:30 ^^
Kiki, was the 30 minute difference really that big?
Okay then
Then at 8 or 9 o'clock, Kiki
I had a fight with my boyfriend last week!
Hey, why did you fight with your boyfriend? Kiki
My boyfriend isn't answering my calls!
what do you think about it!?
Oh my gosh, your boyfriend disappeared?
Oh! But he made an excuse that he was busy that day!
How long has it been since we last heard from each other?
No, I sent the text message at 11, but do you know what time I got the reply?
Well, if you're going to say that, then maybe after lunch at around 3?
I came at 6pm!
Is it true that it's 6pm!?
six hours?
So you worked without even eating?
Kiki no
You must have eaten!
But he didn't even look at his phone!
That's too much
I can give you a call at lunchtime.
That's right! But you know what makes me even angrier?
Why did you do something wrong there again?
no
We're in touch again on the weekends!
On the weekend? It would be nice if you could contact me. Leave Kiki alone.
Have you ever fostered an abandoned dog, Oppa?
Oh I've done it once Kiki
Oh really?
How did you know?
Oh, my friend got drunk and left me at my house. Kiki
Oh my god, Kiki, you want me to raise that kid?
no
You know what's funny about him following me down the street and bringing me here?
What is it?
Was that a completely street dog?
Kiki didn't take her to her own house and left her at our house.
Kiki, so why did you leave Kiki behind?
I don't know
Kiki, you were drunk and acting weird
Kiki So what did you do with the puppy?
I just took her and found her owner Kiki
Kiki, thank goodness
Did you find the owner though?
Oh, you live nearby, Kiki
Kiki, wow, awesome! If this is it, then your brother's friend must have stolen it!
that's right
At that level, it really seems like it was stolen
Does your brother like dodgeball or volleyball?
I think I like volleyball a little more Kiki
Kiki, really?
Oppa, do you play volleyball with your friends often?
no
Kiki, what I see, not what I do with my body
Kiki, then you must have had a good time at the Olympics this time~
Oh right
Actually, I haven't watched either dodgeball or volleyball, but Bread Sister haha
Kiki is right
The Olympics was your last appearance ㅜ
Then I started watching volleyball too
Did you see it?
of course
I cried when I saw that!
Wow, you even shed tears?
I was a huge fan of Kiki
of course
But I wish Sister Ssukbang would appear on variety shows more often now!
Doesn't that older sister come out often?
Hey, it's fixed, so you're now a guest!
Ah, you're talking about something similar to Seo Jang-hoon hyung, Kiki
Kiki, that's right
I really like Bread Sister like Seo Jang Hoon!
Kiki is probably getting ready to come out now
Oppa, I went to the PC room with my friend again yesterday!
Oh right
My pleasure is games
Kiki, it's just the weekend!
How many hours did it take!
Then I should play on the weekends since I work on weekdays.
Kiki okay I'll look at it~
Did you go with that friend again?
that's right
You too, don't lie around on the weekend and come play a game
no
It's cold outside these days, Kiki
Do you do it suddenly every day?
No
The PC room is very warm
I'm really good at sudden
But the road is cold!
Match
It's very cold when you go out
But it's warm under the mask
Kiki then then~
Then if I go, will you buy me ramen?
Hey, I can buy you some Jjapaghetti too~
Then I want you to buy me a Jjapaghetti with Chaekkeutsal!
Oh, you should buy that with your own money~
Kiki no no
My brother told me to come, so I'm buying it!
no
Your attitude is not good.
I'll just buy you a cola
Have you ever fought while traveling with a friend?
I think traveling is always a battlefield Kiki
Kiki why why
Men just don't have that!
I don't travel with men.
Kiki, why didn't you and about 15 of your friends get together and go to a pension and have fun!
Ah, let's not fight over something like that
Kiki, you said it was fun back then!
that's right
Kiki, I was happier than playing with my girlfriend
Is this true?
Am I watching this?
You shouldn't tell my girlfriend haha
But, I think your girlfriend likes hanging out with her friends the most, right?
no
The dog prefers to go out and play with me.
Kiki, are you sure!?
I heard you're not going on a trip with your boyfriend this time, but rather a camping trip with your friends?
Oh, that's something I rejected ~ haha
Kiki, is that so~? Or not~
Still, I have to go to Jeju Island for my next lover's birthday, Kiki
Honey, where did you go on your business trip today?
I went to Cheonan and Chungbuk Eumseong today...
Kiki, I heard it was really hot in South Chungcheong Province today!
that's right
The weather was really nice?!
Kiki, really?
They said it was perfect weather for a picnic?
Oh right
I thought of my girlfriend... lol
Kiki So did you contact her?
To your girlfriend?
Yeah, I told you to get ready to sweat because the weather is nice, Kiki.
Kiki, did you take a picture of the sky that makes you laugh?
Oh, I took a picture of that. Can you send it to me too?
no
Because kids post a lot of it on Instagram~
Ah, I didn't see the uploaded photo Kiki
Kiki Of course
My friends posted this, but they're not your friends, right? Kiki
Oh, your friends are different from my friends Kiki
The mood is different
Kiki, so five of my friends went up to the sky in a row~
Wow, it seems like it's true that they fight among themselves, Kiki
Wow, African elephants are now born without tusks!
Huh, why?
It mutated like that? Corona?
Are you saying that this is an evolved elephant?
Is it evolution?
I don't think it's evolved, Kiki
Is that so?
Is this a trade-off that evolved to avoid being targeted by poachers?
Without that, it doesn't hit the target?
First of all, poachers target elephants for their ivory!
Make decorations out of it! Sell them for a high price!
Then what is that elephant called?
Now we're going to call it an elephant without tusks?
Look, even a Chihuahua has a long-haired mother, so they call her a long-haired Chihuahua Kiki
Kiki So now that there are no ivory, then the elephant is an elephant?
Kiki the Elephant
This is perfect Kiki
Kiki but we shouldn't laugh at this ㅜ
I'm saying that the elephant is pitiful!
Oh, then shouldn't we stop them from catching the elephant? Kiki
no
Elephant poaching is already banned, but they continue to do it illegally!
Then we have to catch the poachers quickly, Kiki.
Wow Tesla is awesome Kiki is so cool!
Why the dog again
Why did it come up again? Why?
Kiki, these guys have hit a new high this time!
What did you say you were making that for?
I don't know
But Tesla CEO was really scary Kiki
Why did you say something nonsense again?
no
This guy really teased his employees, Kiki
What did you say to your employees when the stock price fell?
no
No, but first of all, when we were hiring employees, there was a standard. Do you know what it was?
Is this perhaps a slave-like standard?
Kiki recently said that she deliberately chose someone who was far from her company and hometown.
Kiki, trying to keep you from going home
Wow, Kiki, I won't let you go home
Are you telling me to just work?
Oh right
But it's a bit different from other evil landlords!
Huh? What makes you different from other business owners?
Kiki, you didn't go home either
So I don't let my employees make excuses like, &quot;I'm doing well without going, so you can do well too.&quot; Kiki
What is that
Is this the worst bullying of all time? Kiki
Have you never had laser treatment before?
Yeah I tried waxing instead of laser
Wow, awesome, oppa, isn't it Amazon right now?
Oh right
So my girlfriend ripped it off Kiki
Kiki, yeah, oppa, you have to do something,
There are so many, it's disgusting,
Hey, isn't it cool to have a lot of hair?
Oh not at all
That should just be done by a good-looking person
The average person looks dirty
No, I'm fine
Doesn't it look good even with hair?
I think most men think that way.
Oh really?
I think I'm okay though, Kiki
Kiki, but did your girlfriend open it herself?
Oh, I bought that machine... It hurts..
Wow, goosebumps Kiki
Oppa, which part of your body do you wax?
I have a beard...
I refused to do the face and legs thing.
If Kiki and Oppa had done it to my legs, Oppa would have died?
no
My beard is really sore I'm already dead
Oppa, did you just lay the railroad tracks here?
Hey, Railroad, can you speak in beautiful Korean? Kiki
Kiki: Then what do you call it other than railroad?
This is correction, correction~
Don't tease me ㅠㅠ
Kiki oppa said it really hurt when he did that ㅜ
that's right
It hurts every time I do it, not when I do it ㅠㅠ
Wow, how many teeth did you have pulled out?
I had 4 teeth pulled Kiki
Oh my gosh ㅜㅜ Didn't it hurt when you pulled it out?
It hurts so much to have my teeth pulled out ㅠㅠ
I know because I had my wisdom teeth pulled out and it hurt.
Ah, wisdom teeth are nothing, really Kiki
Kiki, why does it hurt more to tighten the railroad?
I hate going to the dentist more and more Kiki
Kiki, no!
It hasn't even been a year yet!
I'm so mad I have to do this for two more years Kiki
Oppa, what did you buy online this time?
Oh, I bought a Poggle jacket Kiki
Kiki Pogle jacket?
I was going to buy you that for your birthday~
Oh, thank goodness
This is cheap Kiki
Kiki, how much is that?
I bought it on Instagram for 50,000 won Kiki
Wow, goosebumps Kiki
It's Poggle, but it's cheaper than I thought!?
Oh, it's even an imitation~
It's pretty, it's pretty~
Kiki okay kiki
But it's salty, so isn't it expensive?
No
This is cheap kiki
It's winter clothes
Where is that brand name knockoff?
Have you heard of it? Not Polo, but Holo~
Kiki But I can't tell if Polo is really salty or real Kiki
that's right
So I just bought one for salty taste Kiki
Kiki, you did well Kiki
It's okay, just wear it with confidence!
Oh, so I'm going to buy my girlfriend something too, Kiki
Hey, did you see what I was doing when I played this time?
I think that's totally nonsense right now?
Kiki is right
But Shin Bong-seon and Mi-ju are coming out?
Oh right
I saw you singing that song
Did you see that Shin Bong-seon imitating the Ogem Mugunghwa doll?
no
I haven't seen it, but just thinking about it makes it look good Kiki
Oh really Kiki
You really suit each other Kiki
Ah, I guess I'll have to check it out later, Kiki
Kiki, where did you get the exact same clothes? The synchronization rate is 100%
I saw it, but you don't know if it's Shin Bong-seon? Kiki
It's not Kiki
They look the same
And the rest of the people are wearing those gym clothes Kiki
Who did Miju play?
But that number doesn't come out and it looks like he's just wearing gym clothes!
These days, all the entertainment shows are copying Ogame. Kiki
Kiki but Shin Bong-seon really must watch Kiki it's hilarious!
okay
Or you can send me the link later Kiki
Oppa, are you still watching One Piece?
no
It's been a long time since I've seen you, Kiki
Oh my gosh ㅜㅜ My girlfriend even bought me a figure!
that's right
Kiki, you're keeping it nicely
Are you sure you're keeping it nicely?
Isn't there dust falling on top?
that's right
It's dusty, but I'm keeping it nicely Kiki
Does Kiki Oppa also have a separate exhibition hall?
Oh, there aren't many, but I have one or two on display, Kiki
Oh, then can you tell me which characters are on display?
First of all, I got Doflamingo as a gift from my girlfriend~
Oh Doflamingo?
Is that kid from One Piece too?
that's right
Kiki gave me a present because she said she was my favorite character
What kind of character does he have?
Kiki is so cute and sharp and pink
Kiki, is it because you're like my brother that you feel sympathy for each other?
Hey, I can't even swear at this Kiki
I'm so innocent haha
Don't you love fast food, oppa?
Then look at my body
I absolutely love Kiki
Kiki is so funny, I have to admit it~
I heard that a new Lotte product came out this time!?
that's right
Kiki, I think something like squid came out
Oh right
I heard they give out some kind of prize?
Huh?
I thought it was just a set discount
Kiki Nono
They gave me something like a business card there!
Squid game, that business card?
Wow, I have to try it
Kiki, if you win first place, the prize money is 4.56 million won!
This is awesome
Then I should go eat and apply Kiki
Kiki, I'm going to try Lottery this time too!
The squid burger disappeared from Lottery, but it came back to life thanks to Kiki Ogame
It's not Kiki
This time it's black squid bargaining!
Oh right
I saw it in a picture Kiki
I have to try that too
Okie okie kiki
Oh, come on, let's scratch off our business cards together!
Oh okay
If I win, I'll disappear Kiki
Are you planning on moving now, oppa?
no
I don't have money to split up Kiki
Oh really?
I'm going out soon!
Oh, where are you moving to?
I'm going to Nonsan this time!
Isn't it a bit weird to come from Seoul?
Yeah but I'm a country girl~
that's right
You look better in Nonsan than in Seoul, Kiki
Kiki admits Kiki
I want to go down quickly!
But I don't want to go home Kiki
Then why do you want to come down and live alone?
Kiki: Oh, I have a lot of stuff now and I like living alone, so I'm trying to find a house!
Oh right
Kiki said that if you live alone and come out, you can't live together
that's right
And I also have a new mattress at home~
Oh, if you like the mattress, give it to me
Kiki, this costs 130,000 won. Is it okay?
Isn't that a great value for money?
Oppa, don't you get motion sickness or anything?
Yeah, I don't think I've ever had motion sickness, man~
Oh I'm jealous Kiki
Then, when you go on a trip with your friends, who usually drives?
Most of the time I do it a lot Kiki
My car is big
I see
Oppa, what's the car paper?
It's my carnival, Kiki
So I went with a group of mine
Wow, that's crazy. My brother lives alone, so why is he doing a carnival?
I'm driving to pick up people, Kiki
Okay~
Then, it would be one for you, oppa?
Oh right
Me 1st class Kiki
Of course, type 1~
I have one too~
Oh, you got something good for a woman?
of course
I received intense training from my dad back then!
Did your father teach you without getting angry? Kiki
no
We fought like crazy
Didn't your brother do that?
Yeah I did well from the beginning ^^
What company on earth does your brother work for?
I work at a social welfare company Kiki
Kiki Oh, wow, oppa, do you have a license too?
Yeah I studied hard this time and got it Kiki
Wow, oppa, did you get a first-class degree?
Oh right ^^
Kiki, you've done all the practice
Kiki, daebak, I thought it was hard to get a first-class one!
But since it was my mom's company, I had seen it before, so it was okay.
Oh really?
In the end, oppa, you're a parachute too?
Kiki, a parachute?
Aren't you being too harsh?
Kiki then what is it~
You probably didn't even have an interview~
Oh, that's right, Kiki
I myself am a high pass award
Kiki, really?
This is my first time hearing this, but I get it Kiki
So what time do you get off work?
I'm leaving work at 6 o'clock Kiki
Me too~
But I'm a contract worker, so let me leave work on time!
Ah, if you're not a contract worker, then you're an employee, so you're working overtime Kiki
When you were in the military, did your girlfriend come to see you?
Oh, I was single when I was in the military.
Okay
You broke up before you went into the military?
no
I didn't have one before... I didn't have a lover before I went to the military Kiki
Kiki: So what happened after you were discharged from the military?
Oh right
I became popular after I was discharged from the military
Kiki, did you lose a lot of weight in the military?
no
I've always maintained a muscular body Kiki
Oppa, you were a pig before you came in.
Isn't it too harsh to call it a pig? Kiki
Kiki Then I'll call you Chubby~ Chubby!
okay
I'm not fat, I'm chubby
Kiki: Okay, I understand~
But my cousin went in and gained more weight.
Looks like it fits you well there, Kiki
They told me to do it in the military
Kiki and the creepy kiki
But he says he's completely adapted to it and is comfortable there.
In my opinion, that's exactly where the dog is.
Drive a stake, Kiki
Oppa, you must have gone to a taekwondo academy when you were young, right?
Kiki, I used to go to that a lot with the kids in elementary school.
Kiki, really?
Latte didn't have many friends who went to school!
Why don't most people go to Taekwondo?
Kiki is right
But we were a rural school, so the kids just played.
Oh, so rural schools don't have special activities or anything like that.
Kiki, there was something creepy like that!
But the kids didn't do all that and played in the playground.
Why is that funny Kiki
It would be nice to do something interesting
Kiki: But back then, I liked playing with kids more than going to school, even if it was Taekwondo!
that's right
I used to ride my bike and play all day long, Kiki
Kiki is right
The kids even brought inline skates!
Kiki, didn't you have any friends who came out riding Kiki Heelys?
Kiki Huh, you're talking about Wheelis, right?
that's right
Kiki those sneakers with wheels
Kiki and Goosebumps
But I guess those kids got hurt a lot and disappeared?
It wasn't dangerous enough to hurt you, but you should have been careful, Kiki.
How is your parents' health these days?
My parents are still healthy
What about you guys?
My dad went to the hospital this time!
Oh, what's wrong with your father?
Oh, Dad, I hurt my back while chopping firewood.
Oh my, you have to be careful, it's cold ㅠㅠ
So, when we said we'd give him money and get rid of him, he said, &quot;Now, he's 60 years old!&quot;
right
Now, your father also needs to be careful because of his age, Kiki
So, if you and your friend were to come with you and your friend got hurt, we have to pay all the money!
right
If your friend gets hurt, you have to compensate them ㅠㅠ
Let's change it~
So 2 million won a year is a good deal!
200 a year?
But it's not just something you'll need in the winter.
Kiki: Oh, but you don't do that on any other days except summer!
Well, it's necessary in the spring and fall when it's chilly Kiki
that's right
Even my house is cold so I have to take it off almost 365 days a year!
Oh, it must be cold in the house, Kiki
When are you planning to have a second child, oppa?
Once you get married, you won't even think about having a second child.
Kiki, aren't you getting married soon?
no
I broke up a few days ago Kiki
I'm sorry
There are a lot of people who have broken up these days, haha
Everyone has high standards now and if something doesn't look good, they immediately cut it off Kiki
Kiki and Goosebumps
Are the women around you like that?
no
I think it's the same for both men and women, Kiki
Kiki, I see
No, oppa is a real person, so I will return to you!
no
You can go
I got ripped off for a lot of money...
Huh? Are you telling your ex-girlfriend that you owed her money?
that's right
I gave him pocket money every day, but
It's a shame I can't swear
Wow, how much allowance did you give each month?
Nana, give it to me!?
You can't give it to me~
I gave Kiki around 300,000 to 500,000 won
Wow, that's crazy. I'll tell you my account number first.
no
You don't need to have an account with me ^^
Oppa, do you like cats or dogs?
I don't really like animals Kiki
Why am I getting goosebumps?
This cute idol
I just don't see it very well, Kiki
No, I have been eyeing a stray dog lately, so I asked my brother if he could take care of it.
Oh, an abandoned dog?
Where did you find that?
No, I saw it on an app I use a lot these days, but the baby will be euthanized soon.
Oh, these days, they send a lot of messages through apps and things like that...
A good owner needs to appear ㅠ
Yeah ㅜㅜ
But I've been seeing this kid for a few days now and I still haven't heard anything.
Are you not in a position to raise it?
I have a cat at my house. It's a mess.
I don't think I can take responsibility ㅠㅠ
I can't help it if my brother hates me ㅜㅜ
Oh my, there must be a much better owner than me ㅠㅠ
that's right
That must be the case, or is it that kid's fate?
right
Don't worry too much, it'll hurt your feelings
What are your hobbies these days, oppa?
I drink and play with kids all the time
Kiki's muscular body is all gone~
No
That's different
I play a lot of golf
Oh my, young Sarum is playing golf?
that's right
My friends are all doing it so I'm doing it too Kiki
Kiki, really?
How long has it been?
It's been about two or three months since I did it Kiki
Oh really?
Then you haven't gone out to the field yet?
Yeah still Kiki
I'm working hard to learn the posture
Oh really?
Then, does your brother also have a dedicated teacher?
no
It's not a full-time position, but when you go there, he takes turns looking after you Kiki
Kiki, I see. How much is it per month?
I spend about 500,000 won a month
You try it too
Kiki and no,
I'm okay, I'll watch from afar.
Kiki, but I said it would be good to learn it
Let's do it when you have time~
Oppa, don't you know what a liar game is?
Liar I know that Kiki
Wow, creepy
My fat brother knows?
Oh I know that
Why is that - -
Kiki, did you know that there's an idiot mode?
Idiot mode? I've never heard of that before Kiki
Kiki hahahaha it's new this time~
Oh, how do you do that?
This one person has a different topic, the rest have the same topic!
Isn't that how it was originally?
no
Originally, only one person was listed as a liar!
Oh right
I think so, Kiki
Then does that come out as something similar?
Oh but the fool is only one person with different keywords. He's the only one who's really stupid. Kiki
Oh, then are you deliberately teasing an idiot, Kiki?
Kiki Oh, so the rest of the kids have to pretend not to know Kiki
Wow, that's awesome Kiki
That sounds interesting
You should try it Kiki
Oppa, if you were to go to Jeju Island right now, who would you want to go with?
I want to go on a family trip now Kiki
I see
How long has it been since you last went on a family trip?
We used to go every year, but we couldn't go this year. Kiki
I see
You managed to get there last year, though?
I went to Jeju Island last year too, but I went east so I should go west Kiki
Kiki's west side is definitely Daecheon sea mouse~ Guigwi
No, Jeju Island!
West of Jeju Island!
Kiki, not here in the west
Kiki Ah Kiki What's on the west side of Jeju Island?
What might be there?
I haven't searched yet Kiki
Kiki: As far as I know, Udo is in the east!
Oh right
So I went on a trip to the east, Kiki
This time I want to go west, Kiki
Kiki is right
But there's a lot to see in the east!
no
Kiki, it seems like there are a lot of things to do in the middle of Aewol
Kiki, really?
There must be Mt. Halla in the middle!
Ah, I've never been to Mt. Halla either Kiki
I'm going to play in November hahaha
Oh, where are you going to play, Kiki?
I'm going to Anseong to play this time~
Go see the flowers~
Are you going to see the flowers to welcome fall?
Oh right
I'm going to see the cosmos~
Oh, my mom likes that too. Take her with you.
Kiki's mom, can you come to Anseong?
Oh, mother, I'll grab the money and send it...
It's not Kiki
It's cold and it's too dangerous for mom to come alone.
no
Let me play with the flowers.
Kiki no,
Haha my mom won't even let me play with flowers haha
Kiki, you're originally supposed to be filial to other people's mothers and stuff.
Kiki: Then later, will you take my mom to Jeju Island?
Oh yeah
Then let's go on a filial piety trip together, Kiki
Oh, that's a good idea, isn't it?
If you warm me up, will you listen?
Yeah, okay
Traveling is more fun when there are lots of people Kiki
Wow, Coupang delivered a 2005 cooking oil box Kiki
Wow, you sent it without checking that?
Kiki But isn't it more shocking that there's one from 2005?
Well, maybe there could be something...
But I don't think you've organized it
Kiki, but this isn't a fabrication, it's the real deal!
So what did Coupang say?
They said they would refund me, but what would have happened if I had eaten this?
No, refunds aren't the problem, Kiki
It's not just 1-2 years, it's been a long time
Kiki, so this isn't attempted murder, Kiki
In 2005, when I was in the 5th grade, Kiki
Wow, this is crazy
Wow, goosebumps, I was in elementary school Kiki
That's why it was manufactured back then, Kiki
Yeah Kiki
And the creepy thing is remember the 2005 brand Kiki
Wow, that's right Kiki
The brand is probably a brand of memories, Kiki
Yeah Kiki
Wow, that gave me goosebumps, but the person who received this was really angry.
of course
Kiki says it makes you even angrier to raise a child
Did you know that Halloween is coming soon?
Halloween? When is that date, Kiki?
Kiki Hul Kiki Don't you know it's October 31st?
Oh, was that the end of October, Kiki?
Kiki, that's right
But it's a much hotter day in the US than in our country!
right
But our country also had a lot of fun back then. Kiki
Kiki is right
But America is doing something different this Halloween lol
Aren't you supposed to put on makeup and give out candy?
What are you doing this time?
Kiki, no, this time Ogame was a huge hit, they made Dalgona lol
Oh, this time we're playing the Dalgona game without giving candy?
Is it okay?
Kiki, that's right
Now I have to poke that with a needle, Kiki
Kiki, you know that if you do that with saliva on it, it works, right?
Kiki Of course
Or lick from behind like Lee Jung Jae~
Oh but that's too ugly so I can't do it Kiki
Kiki admits Kiki
But can you earn money to live?
Then you can just do it to survive, Kiki
Have you ever gotten a perm, honey?
I tried a perm and a half-and-half chicken hair.
Kiki goosebumps
Half and Half Chicken Siranya Kiki
What were you really obsessed with back then, Kiki?
Kiki Oppa, a boy I know got his hair cut before he went to the military
Oh my god, by fire?
Why on earth did you do that, Kiki?
Kiki I just set fire to it anyway Kiki
Wow, there were no dog burns?
Are you alive?
Kiki, uh, just that gasoline thing? You know, you played around with that, Kiki.
But that's also very strong-hearted, Kiki
I can't
Kiki, so the hair salon lady did it, and I watched the video and it was really funny
If you still have that video, send it to me Kiki
Kiki Oh but that's old and expired Kiki
Oh, then tell that guy to send it again Kiki
Kiki, I'm embarrassed because I don't keep in touch with that friend anymore
no
Call me and tell me you thought of it.
Oppa, do you like alcohol the best in the world?
Oh right
Kiki, I'm living on alcohol right now
Kiki, you eat because you're lonely when you're alone, right?
That's also true, I'm bored so I'm going to meet up with my friends and hang out.
Kiki, do you have any friends you meet often these days!?
Hey, Kiki, you have a drinking buddy that you always drink with
Kiki, you two are seriously drunk right now!
that's right
So I exercise with you, Kiki
Kiki, are you sure?
Are you sure you're exercising?
Then it's not certain
Do you want to touch my body? Kiki
Kiki no
It looks like it'll be soft and ripple-like?
are you okay!
Kiki, it's swaying
Did you see that in a mirror?
Kiki no
I'm not even shaking!
You should exercise quickly before you gain more weight~
Kiki, okay
But now is the time for hibernation, so you have to eat a lot.
Ah, it's a bit dangerous outside the blanket right now, Kiki
Bro, have you ever been scammed while trading used items?
Oh I have one Kiki
Kiki, really?
How many big ones?
I think I got two big ones, Kiki
Oh my god!?
Why is it so simple?
Aren't the big things you and I think different?
Aren't you talking about Kiki 200!?
no
I said 20
Why are you so liver-sucking?
Kiki, is that so?
But 20 degrees is big!
I was trying to buy a ticket as a gift for a friend, but I got scammed. Kiki
Kiki oh my gosh this is crazy
What an incident that happened!
I think it was 4 years ago, Kiki
Kiki and Daebak, whose concert tickets were those?
That's BTS's ticket there Kiki
It was Ami Kiki
This is crazy but BTS tickets are only 20?
That's a black market ticket
The original price was said to be cheaper than that, Kiki
Oppa, have you ever actually seen a celebrity?
Oh, are you coming to a festival or something? Or are you just passing through?
Kiki Just looking at it as a whole!
Oh, I saw a lot of singers coming to our festival, Kiki
Kiki, really?
Oppa, when is the university festival?
no
Festival Kiki here in Nonsan
Ah, I saw Kiki and Hong Jin-young! In the daughter's wedding
Kiki dog, have you been to Nonsan?
I remember Cultwo so well Kiki
Is Cultwo a true story?
When did you come?
In what year?
It's been a while, Kiki
It's so funny, Kiki
Kiki, really?
Does Cultwo also sing?
Oh, there were one or two famous songs, Kiki
Oh really?
I didn't know Cultwo released an album!
Kiki, the dog said there that they earned 500 won from the music and played together. Kiki
Kiki, one Chupa Chups for 250 won each Kiki
Oh right Kiki
It's really funny when you say things like that
Kiki, please come and listen to it once when you get home
Oppa, do you like mixed swimming? Mixed swimming~?
Doesn't everyone watch Netflix these days? Kiki
Kiki is right
I made my own private movie theater yesterday
Oh, did you buy and install that?
No Kiki
I just watched it on my laptop with Netflix installed!
Oh yeah I do that at home too
Kiki and I tried it for the first time yesterday and why is it so good?
It's definitely better to watch it on a laptop than on a cell phone, Kiki
Kiki is right
But the picture quality of the cell phone is better
admit
But I like a laptop that is big and can be used while using a cell phone.
Kiki is right
But it's annoying because my laptop volume isn't that loud
Why can you adjust the volume on your laptop too Kiki
Kiki, no, it's small even when turned up to the max.
Then maybe it's time to change your laptop...
Kiki is right
It's been 8 years, this is awesome
Wow, wow, that's amazing that it runs on a laptop Kiki
What are you eating for dinner now?
I'm eating jam on toast right now
Oh really? I'm eating bread right now Kiki
Oh seriously, sis, I really like bread
Kiki, really? You like rice more than bread?
I like bread more than rice
Oh my god, don't Koreans eat rice?
The rice is good, but the bread is so delicious
What kind of jam does Kiki Jam eat?
The jam is carrot strawberry jam.
It's strawberry jam after all, Kiki
We make that ourselves at home!
Oh really in person?
Give it to me
Kiki, you know that we have peaches at our house, right?
Oh, is it really a peach?
Give me a peach
Did you know that Kiki's peach jam is also really delicious?
Ah, seriously, give it to me, sis!
How often do you clean your room?
I do it every day as soon as I open my eyes
Kiki Oh, you're neater than I thought?
Yeah, then I'm really neat
Kiki: Then do you have personal trash cans?
Yeah, then it's in the room
How often do you empty it?
Me about once every three days?
I have two trash cans right now, one in my room and one in my bathroom.
Oh seriously, I don't think my sister will clean
Kiki Meya? I'm good at cleaning, right?
Oh, I really don't think she'd lie. Girls don't do that.
But I throw away Kiki once a week
Oh really? Isn't that too much?
Kiki: No, but I have to buy trash bags~
Oh, that's why you're doing that
Are you not going anywhere to play this weekend?
I don't go out much on weekends
Oh really? Don't you think it's a waste to use a foreign car only for commuting?
Yeah, I like resting, even though it's a shame... I can't help it
Kiki Oh my gosh Kiki, but don't you have to drive a foreign car for a long time?
Yeah, that's right, I guess I should give it a try
But my girlfriend always goes to Gagong
Wow, awesome Kiki, you and your girlfriend are truly in love?
I'm really in love with my girlfriend haha
Kiki, if it's love that can give me a foreign car, I'll marry you~
Yeah, it's okay, you can put it all in
Kiki Oh, are you okay? What if I really hit you?
My girlfriend will pay anyway haha
Kiki and you are really cool~
Don't I have a boyfriend like you?
Kiki, is it real love?...
I'm going to get a boyfriend
Kiki I have a boyfriend, but I don't have a foreign car.
Oh right, there is Kiki
No, foreign cars are nothing special!
What was the most difficult part-time job you've ever had?
The hardest thing for me was going to the glass factory.
Oh, that famous glass factory in Nonsan?
Yeah, that's right, Samkwang Glass is really hard there
Kiki, no kidding, my friends went there and cheered too Kiki
Yeah, no kidding
I went there and ran away.
Right Kiki, how many hours did you work?
I worked part-time for 8 hours.
But it was 8 hours, how many hours did it take to come out?
I ran out after about three hours
Kiki, oh my gosh, how did you get the money for that?
I called Albabi and asked for the money
Kiki, but is it right to give it to someone like that?
Oh, originally I wasn't supposed to do that, but I did it anyway
Oh really?
I knew it would be hard there, so I expected you to leave!
Yeah, really, a lot of people were leaving.
Didn't you like the taste of military food when you were there?
no
I just enjoyed everything
Kiki, really? There's a controversy about poor school meals again these days!
Ah, really, I have to give you something delicious to eat
Haha, that's right, but you used expired food ingredients!
Oh seriously, that's too much, it's crazy
Kiki, you didn't have any diseases like food poisoning back then, did you?
It really hurts my heart, but I had food poisoning
Huh? Did you get it when you were in the military?
Yeah, that's right. I think I got it because I ate something wrong in the summer.
Then you must have been admitted to a military hospital?
I wasn't hospitalized, I just took some medicine and rested.
Can I do that?
If it was food poisoning, you could have died!
But strangely, they didn't admit me to the hospital.
Really? That's interesting.
Did you just rest in the barracks?
Yeah, I just went in there and rested.
What kind of academy have you attended so far?
I am a Taekwondo computer piano academy
Wow, Taekwondo is the best for boys!
Ah, I also went to a study room haha studying
Kiki's study room? I went to a study room when I was little too!
Yeah, I just went there and played with my friends all day long.
Kiki Me too Kiki But I liked it the best when the teacher drew circles with a red pencil
Oh really, that's what happened to me too haha
Kiki, that's right Kiki, but didn't you do your homework?
I don't do it every day, do you?
Kiki Of course~ Homework is best done in the study room~
Sister, you didn't study, right? Huh?
Kiki, I really couldn't do it~
Don't you know that when you're in elementary school, you just have to play?
Ah, it's cool to see you admit it. Elementary school kids need to play.
Kiki Of course
But I couldn't do it even in middle school~
Oh, really, I wasn't very good at it either
You are close with your younger sister.
Yeah, I'm really close with my younger sister.
Oh really? Isn't it true that younger sisters are usually close with their oldest brothers?
No, I'm scared of my eldest brother
Oh really? Is your eldest brother really reserved?
Yeah, my eldest brother is a bit reserved
Kiki: I see. So your eldest brother was a military sergeant?
Yeah, I'm the more affectionate type.
Then, how much is the age difference between your first brother and younger sister?
Is it 3 years or 4 years?
Isn't there a 4 year age gap? They're all born the same year!
Yeah, that's right, it's a 4 year age difference
Kiki, that's right Kiki
Do you chat a lot with your sister?
Yeah I talk a lot about love Kiki
Kiki Wow, awesome! Talking about love with your little sister is a bit embarrassing!
Yeah, that's funny. He knows his girlfriend's feelings well.
Are you willing to marry your girlfriend now?
Yeah, I'm definitely going to get married.
Kiki, wow, when are you planning to do this?
I don't think there will be a woman like this in a year?
Oh my gosh ㅜㅜ Really?
How old did you say your current girlfriend is?
My girlfriend is 4 years older than me
Wow, wow, you're really talented.
Yeah, I seduced you. I followed you around all the time.
Kiki is really awesome, awesome Kiki
Then where is your girlfriend's hometown?
It's nothing special
My girlfriend is also in Nonsan
Oh, so we can have the wedding in Nonsan without any worries?
Yeah, we should do it in Nonsan.
There is only one good place in Nonsan!
I think Noblesse is the best
Kiki, that's right, that's a famous restaurant for Palbochae Kiki
Oh, you really like that, sis
When you get married, are you going to raise a dog with your wife?
I want to raise a turtle Kiki
Kiki, the turtle, I've been looking into it for a while now~
Yeah turtle kiki
Oh really, you too, sister?
Kiki, the turtle's personality seems to be a bit similar to mine!
Why are you so slow? Kiki
It's probably similar
Kiki, right Kiki, you're just lying there doing nothing, me Kiki
Ah Kiki but that's the same for me too
Kiki, right? And turtles can live healthily if you keep the humidity and temperature just right!
Ah, I really have to raise it sometime later
Kiki Oh, and depending on the species of turtle, there are species that can live up to 100 years!
Ah, really, I want to live with you for 100 years too
So, there are people who raise children and then pass them on to their children when they die!
Oh, that's sad...
I think the children will be sad when they see a turtle.
Kiki is right ㅜㅜ
I think it would be good if children could reminisce while looking at that turtle!
Oh, that's true too
Are you exercising these days?
Yeah I'm exercising
really?
You said you go to the gym, but are you still going?
I go to the gym and do it every day. I quit for three months again.
Did you cut off Kiki Wao Kiki Pete too?
No, I was 82 and now I'm 75
Wow Kiki awesome Kiki
You must have gained muscle too, right?
Yeah, that's awesome. You should exercise too, unnie.
Me,? I don't have time to go even on weekends,?
Don't just roll around at home
Hey that's an excuse
Kiki no, it's true,
I have a lot to do at home~
Eight, don't lie
Then do home training at home!
Kiki, I'm doing homework! 30 minutes a day!
Oh really?
Should I try home training too?
Kiki, no, you just keep going to the gym!
Oh, I see...
Health is the best
Did you go to the arcade a lot when you were a student?
Yeah I go there every day Kiki
Kiki, are you good at kicking soccer kicks there too?
I've tried everything
I loved going and pumping
Kiki Pump? Is that dancing?
There's something you can do with your feet, like running.
Right Kiki, have you seen that old video?
No, I haven't seen that
Kiki, go to YouTube and watch it. It's really awesome.
Oh, I'm really curious. I'll have to check it out.
Kiki No, I don't even know which way the arrows are going, but you got them all right!
Oh my gosh, this is awesome Kiki
I can do it too
No, if I look at you, I would say I can't do it?
Ah, I really want to have a mental breakdown
Kiki, you can't even see your feet!
Oh, I want to do that too
Ah, I want to go to the beach and eat grilled clams!
Ah, Daecheon is really the best
Oh really?
I also really like Daecheon grilled clams!
Yeah, go to the clam grill and go between the islands.
Oh my gosh ㅜㅜ Is that the name of the store?
Yeah, that's right, the grilled clams between the islands are super delicious
Oh really?
I have to go in November! Take my mom with you!
Yeah, go with your boyfriend and mom.
Ah, I'll go with my mom first and my boyfriend will say later, &quot;My mom really likes seafood!&quot;
Oh really, my mom and dad like it too
Kiki, really? My mom is a killer!
Oh, I really like raw fish too
Kiki me too Kiki
But I just eat it,
Ah, I really want to eat grilled clams ㅠㅠ
Kiki really ㅜㅜ
I can't go this weekend, so I'll have to go to Daecheon in November!
I should take my girlfriend too
But if you go to Daecheon in November, the wind will be no joke, right?
It must be seriously cold
Kiki: That's why I thought Busan would be hot because it's in the southern region, but it's not because of the wind!
Yeah, Busan is a bit warm, I said.
Kiki: No, I thought Busan would be hot, but there's an ocean there too! That's why it's so windy and cold!
Oh really? I don't think it was that windy when I went there ㅠㅠ
Kiki, really?
But Daecheon is cold anyway, right?
Oh but Daecheon is really cold, I guarantee it
Kiki Aah, I want to eat grilled clams, but I can't stand the cold,
Okay, I'll just eat grilled clams and go home right away.
Kiki ah good idea kiki
I'll see the sea from afar~
The sea is beautiful even from afar
Kiki right Kiki
And Daecheon is in the West Sea, so you can see it from far away~
Yeah, that's right. I saw it from afar and ate the grilled clams right in front of me.
Kiki, you're right, you can enjoy it with your eyes and mouth too~
Right, right, I should go there too
Did you know that the Coast Guard died this time?
Why did you die? What happened?
This time, a Coast Guard member who was assigned to the post after 18 days committed suicide.
Wow, wow, why did you do that?
But this could be due to workplace bullying!
Workplace bullying? That happens a lot.
Oh, ㅜㅜ I said that work was too hard, but I guess I looked down on you after that.
It's hard enough, it's really a shame...
Wow ㅜㅜ Looking at your age, you're now 34 ㅜ
Oh my gosh, that's too bad
You're really young
If you are a married person and would make an extreme choice,
He's a married man, but what about the rest of his family...
But the people who bullied were only given general disciplinary action.
Oh, how can that be? You deserve to be punished more!
So, just like you said, only the remaining family members are harmed!
I really hope those people are miserable for the rest of their lives...
Wow, do you know how much a 4-6 pyeong apartment in Hong Kong costs?
How much? Five hundred million? How much is eight hundred million?
Here too, it's no different from us!
First of all, we need to get 100 million per pyeong!
Oh, this is really great. I want to go and live there.
Kiki Huh? I want to go there and live there, it's too expensive!
No, if I buy one pyeong, the land price will go up again.
Kiki Hong Kong land prices will go up, I don't know for sure, but I don't want to live in a 6-pyeong apartment for 600 million won!
I heard that the price of Sejong apartments has also risen significantly.
Kiki Sejong? It's worth going there,
So you came to the Blue House in Sejong?
So my friend's house was worth 400 million won, but now it's worth 800 million won.
Wow, daebak Kiki, if he really lived in Sejong from the beginning, he would really be daebak!
That's why I'm jealous
I should have bought a house in Sejong and played around there too.
Kiki But you don't have money, right?
But when I looked at the houses here in Hong Kong, they were like total chicken coops!
Hong Kong is really a jackpot, it's a chicken coop... It's like that
Kiki, that's right, the most expensive apartment costs up to 1.7 billion won!
Wow, this is really amazing
Can you catch the difference in your girlfriend all at once?
Yeah, I know, I know that stuff
Kiki Oh really?
My boyfriend didn't recognize me at all!?
Oh, really, I'm a bit sensitive so I know
Kiki Oh, then can you tell me the changed lipstick color too?
You know, my girlfriend likes Dior and Chanel and stuff like that.
Kiki and Sorum, you know the brand name too, right?
Yeah, I know, my girlfriend kept asking me to buy it for her...
Kiki, so you bought everything? At the department store?
Yeah, I bought it at the Jeju Island duty free shop.
Wow, but even if it's a duty free shop, it'll be expensive!
No, but I still want it haha
Kiki, you're really cool, my dongsang~
How much did each one cost?
I think it was about 40,000 won or so
If you go to a department store, that'll probably cost around 60,000 won?
Oh really? I didn't know that.
I have one bad habit!
Oh really, what kind of habit is it? I wonder, Kiki
I keep biting my nails!
Oh seriously Kiki I'm biting my lip
Kiki, really? Don't your lips bleed often?
Yeah, that's right. If you tear it open, a lot comes out. ㅠㅠ
Oh my gosh ㅜㅜ Your lips are where you eat, it hurts.
Yeah, that's why I apply a lot of lip balm haha
Kiki, thank goodness,
I'm just biting, I don't want to bite,
Oh seriously, don't bite your nails, it's not good
Kiki: That's right, but I also find myself tearing it off when I feel anxious without realizing it!
Kiki, I said that was a lack of affection or something.
Wow I think so Give me love!
Kiki I'll give you a lot, sis
Kiki Oh, this is so touching~
Let's eat later~
Okay, okay, buy me something delicious, sis.
Don't you do online shopping these days?
Yeah, I'm ordering chicken jjiji from Coupang these days.
Wow, Kiki, as expected from a Hell Hunter, is buying a dick?
If you want to work out, protein is essential.
Kiki, but I tried the jjiji and it was spicy. Is that okay?
Oh really?
I'm a steak chicken slut
Kiki, I haven't tried that steak, but is it better?
Oh seriously, the steak is much tastier
Kiki, really?
I should try that later too
What about the price?
The price is one thousand six hundred dollars each? That's about it.
Kiki Oh, it's cheaper than I thought?
I bought chicken tikka for around 1500!
Oh really, it's much tastier than that. Buy it and try it.
Kiki Oki Kiki Is there any discount for my first purchase?
If I sign up as a member, I'll get a 5,000 won discount?
Kiki Wow, awesome Kiki Then I have to go buy it right now~
Yeah, let's go buy it right now and get fit
Do you know the program that Moon Se Yoon, Hye Ri, and Shin Dong Yup appear in?
Yeah, I know. What was its name?
Oh, I suddenly can't remember the name of this?
It's Amazing Saturday, isn't it?
Oh right, Kiki, did you know that Key is in there too?
I know, Key has been appearing on I Live Alone a lot lately.
Right Kiki, but that's not important. Do you know that Moon Se Yoon and Key have completely opposite eating habits?
Oh really, I don't know what is this?
Kiki, no, Kiki likes vegetarian food a little more than meat!
Oh, you only eat vegetables. Is that why you're skinny?
Kiki: I guess so, but I asked all the members which part of Andong Jjimdak they like the most.
Yeah, but what did you say? I wonder
But usually, everyone says, &quot;I like legs&quot; and &quot;I like chest fat&quot;
But do you know what the height is?
Oh really, did you say Kiki's neck is nice? No way
Kiki, no, the potatoes inside there,
Oh really? Kiki, potatoes; what are you ordering potatoes for?
What cartoon did you enjoy the most when you were young?
I liked Shinchan because I looked like him.
Kiki ah daebak kiki
Shinchan is still doing it!
Oh really?
I still don't watch TV that much
Kiki, really?
But I also watched it on YouTube after a long time?
Hey, how was it, sis? Did you have fun?
Oh, but the sad thing is that the voice actor changed a bit.
Oh really, I should see it too, I'm curious
ㅜㅜ Shinchan's voice has changed a bit!
Shinchan's voice is cute, I want to hear it
ㅜㅜ I like the old Crayon Shin-chan better, but oh and only the new one has a different voice ㅜ
I need to watch it again Kiki
Oh, you can watch it on YouTube, so take a look!
Okay, I'll watch it again since my sister told me.
Kiki Oh, okay, watch it with your girlfriend later!
Yeah, I should tell my girlfriend to come and see it with me.
Do you like ribs? Marinated ribs?
Yeah I like it. I like marinated ribs better.
you ?
Kiki, really?
Of all the seasonings, I like soy sauce seasoning the best!
Kiki I don't like spicy marinated ribs
What else do you like?
Kiki: I'm a foodie so I like just about anything!
Kiki's eating is good
Chicken is my favorite
Kiki, I admit I'm going to eat chicken tomorrow~
Wow, I'm really jealous. What kind of chicken do you eat?
I want to eat pudding
Ah, I like the sprinkles~
But I don't eat anything else!
Kiki, what did you eat today?
I went to a Korean buffet today!
Kiki, it's been a long time since I've been to a buffet. How was it?
You'd be shocked if you heard the price.
Kiki, how much did you spend?
I guess you have a lot of money
Kiki, hey, it's 5 thousand won here! Isn't it awesome?
Wow, it's really cheap?
Let's go together next time
Ah, I did some spring cleaning today and I thought I was going to die!
It's been a while since you did a spring cleaning?
How long did it take?
Yeah~ About 20 minutes?
It was so hard!
Kiki, it didn't take long, did it?
I want to change rooms
Huh? You have a spare room?
No, that's not it, I just want to change the structure
Oh really? How do you want to change it?
I want to change my bed into a bunk bed
Oh, a bunk bed? Why? Is that better?
No, the room is small so I want to use it more spaciously.
Kiki Oh, I see
Then what are you going to put on the second floor?
I'm going to put a bed on the second floor and use the first floor.
Kiki, don't you usually put things on the second floor?
I don't think there will be much space on the second floor of Kiki, so I'm going to do it the other way around.
Kiki Oh, I see Kiki
But isn't the lighting on the second floor blinding your eyes?
Kiki So I'm thinking about changing the lighting too
Do you have your driver's license now?
Yeah, I just got my driver's license a while ago.
Oh, how many did you get?
I was trying to get 1st class but ended up getting 2nd class
Kiki A If you're a man, you have to get one~
That was a long time ago
Do you have a driver's license?
I got it right away when I was 19, as a first class~
Kiki, are you driving now?
Then, then I have a car too~?
Wow, I'm jealous
I still take the bus
Kiki But now you can take the bus!
But isn't it more convenient to have your own car?
That's right Kiki
But the maintenance costs are no joke!
Kiki, that's right, parking is a problem too
Yeah Kiki, parking costs are going to be huge!
It would be nice if it were true, but I think it costs too much money.
What time did you finish today?
I finished at 10 today because the deadline was late.
Oh, I see. The customer left late?
Yeah, that's true, and I had a lot to finish up.
Oh, I see. ㅜㅜ You had a lot of customers today!?
Seriously, we had the most customers today ever
Oh my god, it's Monday today?
I thought you said today was the weekend?
Kiki, you said you weren't busy on the weekends?
Kiki No, I was busy even on the weekends, but I was busier today
Kiki, daebak, your house will be so nice~
Kiki, do you want to come and work too?
Kiki, if I go there, will they give me a lot of money for Alba?
I'll take care of you as much as you do Kiki
Oh my goodness, I'm an experienced worker so it's expensive?
If Kiki is a career person, it's better for us
Where did you get your military unit assignment?
I served in the military in Gangneung.
Wow Gangneung? The sea there is really pretty!
Kiki, that's right, we could see the whole Gangneung sea from our unit.
Kiki, wow, awesome ㅜㅜ I've never seen the Gangneung sea before!
Wow, really? You can see it when you join the army too.
Kiki, are you telling me to join the army?
Well then, the military has improved a lot these days.
Kiki: Are you telling me to join the military now?
Kiki, not bad, right?
I think I'll do well
Yeah I'll go
Instead, you go to the job group first
Kiki sorry
I think that would be a bit difficult
Kiki, why are you telling me to go away!
You should go too!
I've already been there once
Kiki, are you okay? Can you come in again?
No, I don't want to do it twice
Did you study well when you were a student?
Kiki, have you done it to some extent?
I'm jealous, I really couldn't do it Kiki
How good were your grades?
Kiki I just did well?
Wow, really?
What rank did you get in your class?
I think I got 3rd place in my class
Wow, awesome. Then what rank were you in the whole school?
What place was it? I think it was 50th place?
Kiki Wow, wow, how many students were there in the school at that time?
I think there were about 350 people?
Wow, awesome Kiki, your teachers must have loved it~
Kiki, you liked me because I was a total model student ^^
Kiki That's why I get hit with honey all the time Kiki
Kiki, but you and your teacher were on good terms anyway
Kiki That's right, I've never had a teacher who really scolded me!
Kiki, you're right, it looks like you were also getting some love
Are you just getting off work with your parents?
Kiki, no, I came in first today
Oh really? Where are your parents?
Oh, my parents just came in.
I see. Your parents said it wasn't hard for you?
Kiki, don't be hard on yourself
Still, I think it helped me a lot
Kiki, you're lucky~ You have a dependable daughter~
Are we all going to work together?
Kiki, okay, okay
No I go to work at 11
Kiki: Then what time do your parents leave for work?
Well, my parents leave for work around 9 o'clock.
Wow, awesome. Then how many hours do you work in total?
More than 12 hours a day,? You work a lot ㅠㅠ
Oh my gosh ㅜㅜ You must be so tired
No break time?
Yes, I'm thinking about introducing break time these days.
These days, there are no restaurants that don't have break times, so let's do this!
Kiki: Well, I guess I'll have to talk about this later.
Are you seeing someone right now?
How can you say that to me?
Sorry Kiki, why didn't you have someone you liked!
Kiki, that's also past tense, not now.
Kiki, why didn't things work out with that guy?
Kiki Yeah, it didn't go well for me
Oh my gosh ㅜㅜ Have you ever confessed?
No, it was over before I could confess
Wow, does that guy have a boyfriend?
Kiki Yeah ㅠㅠ I looked it up because it was strong and it was there
Oh my gosh ㅜㅜ You should have at least confessed!
I've had a crush on you for several years! ?
Kiki, you've been in love with me for almost 3 years?
Wow, awesome ㅜㅜ
Is this true?
Are you okay?
Kiki, I had a hard time for a while, but now I'm calm
Dirt ㅜㅜ I'm sad
You don't keep in touch with that friend?
Kiki, we haven't been in touch since then.
Do you have a dog at home right now?
Oh no, we can't raise animals in our house
Why do your parents hate you?
ㅜㅜ I'm sad,
Yeah, that's true, but there's no one to take care of it.
Right ㅜㅜ Do you want to raise it later?
Yeah, I really want to raise a dog or a cat.
Kiki, do you like babies that cry or do you like being cried?
I like babies who nag at me more
Then you should definitely choose the cute gangster!
Gangerjwi is good
I came back today after petting the dog I was walking.
Kiki, really?
What kind of puppy was it?
It was a Pomeranian and it was super cute.
Oh my gosh, isn't that a Pomeranian that looks like a seal?
Kiki is right, it's completely round like a seal
Kiki, wow, that guy's hair is so fluffy ㅜ
That's right, so I came here after writing without realizing how much time had passed.
What kind of exercise do you like?
Kiki I like basketball. Do you?
I just like breathing~
Kiki I like that the best too
Kiki, do you play basketball with your friends?
Kiki Yeah, I still play basketball with the kids I played with in high school.
Wow, awesome lol It's cold these days so I guess I can do it
Kiki, that's right. If you don't stretch your body, you'll get hurt quickly.
Kiki, have you ever gotten hurt playing basketball?
I've been hurt so much, I hurt my ankle too
Kiki, wow, awesome ㅜㅜ Are you sick of it?
Kiki, yeah, once you do it once, it happens often.
Yeah, that must be a problem with your ligaments, right?
Kiki, you're right, you had a hard time once because you hurt your ligament, and that's what happened
Oh my gosh ㅜㅜ I need to go to a Korean medicine clinic and get some acupuncture!
Kiki, that's right. If you get that right, you'll get better quickly. I'm going to try it out.
What are you going to do after work?
Kiki, I have to wash up and play games now.
Kiki, what games are you playing these days!?
Kiki, what are you doing these days?
LoA? Are you talking about Lost Ark?
Kiki, that's right, LoA is a totally awesome game these days
I've only heard about this, but never done it.
Is it that fun?
Oh really? I didn't know at first either, but once I tried it, I got hooked.
Oh really? Is this a game that requires a lot of cash?
Kiki, no, you can do this without being a slut
Is this also a game where I raise my character?
Of course, it's an RPG game, so you have to raise it.
What level are you now? Kiki
Kiki, would you be surprised if you heard my level?
Kiki, why? But I don't know what level is considered high.
Kiki, then first install LoA and come in.
Where have you traveled recently?
I went to Jeju Island last month.
Wow, why are all the people around me going to Jeju Island?
Kiki Jeju Island has become a really hot place, so there are so many people
Kiki Should Jeju Island be considered peak season in September?
It seems like it's peak season all year round these days
That's right Kiki
What did you do when you went there?
Kiki I was climbing Mt. Halla and came down halfway.
Wow, awesome Kiki
Have you thought about climbing Mt. Halla?
Kiki I don't know why I thought that either
Kiki, did you go alone?
Kiki Yeah, I went alone and came back with so much regret.
Wow, you went on a trip to Jeju Island alone?
Yeah, it was comfortable and nice to go alone, and I was able to organize my thoughts.
Kiki, awesome! What do you have to organize your thoughts about!?
Kiki I just had a lot of random thoughts these days, so I went out alone
Where did you say you live now?
I live in Namyangju, Gyeonggi Province
Kiki, how's the weather there now? Is it cold?
It's been really cold lately, but it's warmed up a bit now.
Really? Was it warm there today too?
Kiki: Yeah, it was hot during the day. How was your neighborhood?
Kiki, I was so cold? This is Seoul!
Kiki, really? Doesn't the sun shine well there?
Admittedly, there are only tall buildings around here, so the wind is no joke!
Kiki, if you get hit by the wind from the building, you'll catch a cold.
Damn, I thought I was going to freeze to death!
Kiki, did you dress warmly when you went out?
Of course I wear a padded vest too!
Kiki is dressed really warmly
But what if it's still cold?
Kiki, you should wear your padding now ㅜㅜ
Padding is the best
Kiki, that's right. At night, I see a lot of people wearing long padding.
Wow, did you see that article that came out recently about someone accidentally writing a 0 in an auction?
Oh no?
Does that happen too?
A person won an apartment auction, but the amount was strange!
Huh, really?
How weird was that?
Do you know how much this guy paid for something that should have been 160 million?
Wow, you really didn't buy it for 1.6 billion?
Oh right, they added one more 0,
Oh my god, you did that there?
No, this is a transaction that the successful bidder wrote incorrectly!
So the person who won the bid has that money?
No, I don't know
But the auction is a no-fault affair!
Wow, right!?
Wow, this is awesome.
Isn't that guy so pitiful?
So, even if I cancel this, I still have to pay 10% of the winning bid amount!
Wow, so you lost both your house and your money?
So 1.6 billion is a bit much,
That's true,
This kind of thing is really unfortunate ㅠㅠ
Japan has now lifted restrictions on restaurant operations!
Oh really?
I guess the vaccinations have already been well administered there?
Kiki, no, that's not it, now with corona it's starting!
Oh right, aren't we going to do it soon?
That's right, we said we'd start in November too!
But I didn't get vaccinated!
Wow, then wouldn't that be disadvantageous?
I think I just need to be careful, but that won't work, right?
Kiki, right? I heard that the UK is seeing an increase in the spread of the virus these days.
Kiki Right, Britain is probably 8,000 people I think? Something like that?
Kiki, that's right, it's growing more there.
But it's too hard for self-employed people to restrict restaurant operations.
I don't think there's any way to tune this,
Kiki, that's right. I think it's difficult whether you do it or not.
Yeah Kiki, we really have to do this with Corona, we can't help it~
I need to get vaccinated soon too!
Kiki, that's true
You should use the vaccine pass too
Kiki, that's right, I'll try using the vaccine pass once!
Kiki, I like it. I like it. Let's use it to get back to normal!
Do you like buying clothes?
Kiki Yeah, I like you a lot, don't you?
I like buying clothes too!
What style do you like?
Kiki I just like to dress casually
For me too, casual is the best no matter what
Do you like wearing hats?
Kiki is right
No I hate it when my head is pressed
Oh really? Your hair is really long?
Kiki Yeah, I'm lazy these days so I'm just letting it grow
Wow, awesome Kiki. Is that the long hair that's popular these days?
Kiki, that's right, I'm trying to follow the trend too
Isn't that something that's hard for just anyone to digest!?
No, but it suits me pretty well ^^
Kiki, did you show your long hair to your other friends?
Kiki no you didn't show me only I know
Yeah, if you say you get along well with your friends, I'll admit it~
Kiki, you'll probably admit it soon, right?
When was the last time you were sick?
I broke my arm when I was in elementary school.
Oh my gosh ㅜㅜ It must have really hurt. How did it break?
I was playing with a tree and fell and broke it.
Oh my god, you fell while supporting yourself with Kiki's arm?
Kiki, that's right, that's why I had a really hard time back then
Oh my gosh ㅜㅜ You even have a cast on that. How many months did you have it on for?
Kiki Yeah I think I had a cast on for about two months
Kiki, wow, you weren't admitted to the hospital?
I was admitted to the hospital for surgery and was discharged soon after.
But does your broken arm still hurt?
It's okay as long as you don't overdo it too much.
Thank goodness ㅜㅜ
Did you get anesthesia during the surgery?
Kiki Of course
But I was really scared back then
Kiki, I guess so. I'm squeezing because it hurts even though I'm bitten. Kiki
Kiki, that hurts so much, it makes sense
Did you apply for the mutual aid grant this time?
Kiki: Yeah, I applied last week. What about you?
I applied last week too and got another text!
Hey, what's this text message you sent me? You want me to do it again?
Oh, I got a text telling me to apply, but this time it's different!
Oh my, what's wrong? I didn't come?
The card confirmation amount just popped up!
Oh really?
Why don't I show up?
Kiki, which credit card company did you apply to?
Kiki I applied as a citizen, what about you?
Wow, I'm a citizen too. Why didn't you go?
Kiki, what the heck? Did I do something wrong?
Are you going to treat me like a national VIP again?
Kiki, are you going to experience discrimination like this again?
Kiki, I spent a lot this month~
Kiki, buy me something too~
Do you watch YouTube often?
Kiki Yeah, I see you a lot these days
Kiki, what do you usually watch on YouTube?
Kiki I watch a lot of movie review channels these days
Wow, wow, I see that a lot too!
Alsinam? You know?
Wow, I see that a lot too. Do you see it a lot too?
Oh, look at that, Kiki
You like spoilers too?
Kiki, these days it's better to just watch spoilers
Kiki, me too, but there are genres that I can't afford to be spoiled for!
Wow, I get mad when I get spoiled for a thriller
Well, I like the mystery genre more than thriller!
Kiki, that's right, it's really strong
Kiki, that's right, I have to get that right!
You too?
Kiki Of course that's a spoiler I can't forgive that
Kiki: That's right, but it's a shame there aren't any mystery programs these days!
Kiki, that's right. I wish something fun would come out these days.
What genre of movies do you like the most?
Kiki I like sci-fi genre the best
SF? Then what movie did you see recently?
Kiki I saw Interstellar again a while ago
Wow, that rating is really good!
how is it?
Kiki is really a masterpiece,
Haven't you seen it yet?
Oh, I heard that it's 2 hours long, so I think it'll be boring.
Kiki is right but two hours pass by so quickly
Oh really?
What is the general content?
I later found out that the father was giving signals to his daughter as he was leaving to find a new home.
Hmm Kiki, that new frontier isn't Earth?
Kiki Yeah, now that the Earth is devastated, we're going to a new frontier.
Oh my gosh, I see. So that's why you were wearing a spacesuit?
Kiki is right, I think she's wearing a spacesuit for almost the entire movie
Haha, the actors must have had a really hard time!
That's right. The actors said in interviews that it was really hard.
Jajangmyeon is available at the Daebak Korean buffet today!
Huh? They serve Jajangmyeon at a buffet?
Oh my gosh, Jjajangmyeon is so delicious!
When you say uni jajangmyeon, you mean the old jajangmyeon, right?
Oh, that's right, they put in a huge chunk of potato too!
Wow I really like potatoes Kiki
Kiki, that's right, oppa likes potatoes, Kiki
And then there's also steamed fermented soybeans!
Oh, Jjajang and fermented soybean paste stew go well together?
Kiki no
It feels like they just threw in some delicious food, so even if they don't go together, they're both delicious!
Yes, if it tastes good, I'll eat it even if it doesn't suit me Kiki
Kiki, yes, both were delicious. Add potato cakes here~
Oh, potato cakes are also available? They must have been delicious Kiki
Oh right, and do you know what else came out there?
Hey, what's coming out again?
And the Tangsuyuk Kiki is totally awesome!?
Oh my, isn't that just a Chinese restaurant? Kiki
Did you say that the house you live in now is rent?
No I'm living in a previous world right now Kiki
Wow, I'm so jealous,
How much is the deposit?
I'm currently living here for 7500 Kiki
Wow, you didn't even take out a single loan?
Yeah Kiki I don't have a loan yet Kiki
Wow, I'm so jealous
Usually, small and medium-sized businesses get loans to live off of it!?
But I've been collecting things since before, Kiki
Kiki and daebak yeah it's better than going out!
Oh, so I'm satisfied with the interest-free policy
Kiki: Right, then you'll save some money!
Yeah, there's some of that in the stock market too, Kiki
Kiki, wow, aren't all the stocks blue right now?
Yeah, it's a shame, but it's still a gain for me Kiki
Kiki, really?
By the way, how many rooms does your house have?
I'm staying in a two-room apartment Kiki
Bro, did you say you have tea now?
Yeah, the price of oil is too high right now Kiki
Wow, really? How much is gasoline right now?
I think it's around 1700 won now, but it's too expensive Kiki
Wow, that's amazing! It went up that much?
Why?
I don't know, I wish I could go down too
Kiki: Right, Oppa, do you also charge gasoline?
Oh right I need gasoline ㅠㅠ
Money wasting
Kiki Oh my gosh ㅜㅜ Oppa, how long has it been since you bought the car?
I've been gone for a very long time Kiki, early 20s Kiki
Oppa, then let's switch to an electric car!
Electric car? But they say it's only profitable if you drive it for a long time Kiki
That's right, buy a good electric car and use it for a long time!
But if it gets old, it breaks down and that's why Kiki
Kiki is right, but electric cars are better than gasoline ones,
I don't think electric car people will move because they don't make noise. Kiki
What's the sweetest part-time job you've ever had?
I've never had a honey job before, Kiki.
Real story? Of course I was there~
Oh, what kind of honey part-time job have you done? Kiki
I once worked part-time at home!
Working from home? You mean something like that? Kiki
Oh right, Kiki, but now you're not a full-time employee, you're a part-time worker!
Huh? What are you talking about? Kiki, what did you do for a honey job?
So it was a part-time job from home! Not working from home!
Ah, working from home Kiki
So what did you do~
Kiki, I used to work part-time in the same field as you! Shorthand!
Oh, I see there's a separate part-time job for stenographers too Kiki
I want to do it too
Kiki, that's right, we get 50,000 won per hour!
50,000 won per hour? That's awesome. I want to do that too. Kiki
But this depends on the work Kiki
If it's not hard and easy, I'd be attracted to Kiki
Kiki I got caught doing something hard for 15 hours,
Wow, you made 50,000 won in 15 hours?
Oppa, did you have a girlfriend when you were in the military?
No, I wasn't there when I was in the military Kiki
Kiki, you're right, I said there wasn't any.
Then who came to visit?
Kiki, my friends come here every now and then
Oh really? Where did Kiki go?
I was transferred to Gyeonggi-do, Kiki
Gyeonggi-do's best Kiki
Surely it's not Paju, but Gyeonggi-do?
Kiki, if you were there, the kids wouldn't have come Kiki
Kiki oh my goodness Kiki
But if it were Gyeonggi-do, a lot of my friends would have come!
Yeah, that's right. I came, but I don't know if I came a lot.
Oh wow, Kiki's parents came to visit too?
Yeah, of course your parents came to visit, Kiki.
I see, Kiki. So you must have found a pension nearby and played around there?
Yeah, I got a room in front and played and rested there, Kiki.
Kiki, it was really hard coming back from vacation, wasn't it?
That was like the real road to hell, Kiki
Bro, are you studying for a qualification right now?
No, you don't have any plans to study yet?
Well, I haven't done it yet, but there's something I want to do!
What do you want to study?
I love dogs! Homemade dog treats! Making them!
Oh, does that require a separate license too?
Oh, that's right, kids, there are things you shouldn't eat!
Oh, I see. There are a lot of things to know.
Kiki: That's right, so I'm going to study!
Don't you make cat treats instead of dog treats?
Just give them Churu as cat treats and they're done.
What is it Kiki
I'm going to get a cat soon ㅠㅠ
Kiki, really?
Just give the cat that dried herring!
Dried herring? I should look into that too, Kiki.
Oh Kiki, if you watch the video, the kids really enjoy eating it!
Kiki, I'm also trying to become a dog owner, so there's a lot I need to know.
Have you ever fought with your parents?
Of course we fought a lot when Kiki was young
Kiki, is it the storm and stress period? Kiki
Why fight?
When I was young, I rebelled and fought when people nagged me. Kiki
Hal Kiki, did your brother yell at your parents?
Yeah, I think it's like raising your voice like that Kiki
Kiki Wao, was that when you were in high school?
No, I think it was like that a lot in middle school, Kiki
In middle school? That was awesome?
Weren't you afraid of talking back to your parents back then?
Yeah, back then I was so energetic that I didn't have anything like that, Kiki.
Kiki, has the high school days calmed down now?
We didn't fight like that in high school, Kiki
You're an iron man, Kiki
Yeah, I'm mature~
Even after going to the military, you came back strong~
That's amazing~
The bigger it is, the more I say something Kiki
Kiki: Yeah, yeah, are you doing well now?
Right now I'm nagging Kiki to take care of his health
When was your first love?
My first love was in middle school~
Wow, Kiki, isn't it fast?
Why does everyone date in middle school?
Kiki, but your brother was an engineering major?
We were apart!
No, it wasn't engineering in middle school, but Kiki
Wow, then how did you meet that girlfriend?
There were some girls I used to hang out with back then, Kiki
Kiki, really?
Then what did you usually do with that girlfriend?
Kiki just seemed to mostly sit on the bench and play
Haha, back then I used to go to karaoke a lot, but your family doesn't go to karaoke?
Oh right, we each collected 500 won and went to karaoke Kiki
Kiki goosebumps kiki
But wasn't it 5,000 won per hour?
Kiki got 5 thousand won at that time
Kiki, you go with 10 people
Kiki goosebumps kiki
The place I went to even gave me 2 liters of water
Kiki is right, they give you a lot of water and a lot of service.
Honey, do you know that if you have a cat, you'll lose a lot of money?
Oh, so I'm thinking about whether I should get insurance.
Kiki But I think insurance isn't necessary yet
Oh really? There are people who do that too Kiki
Kiki, but I said you don't have to listen
I'd rather save money!
How far can you go on the moon if you raise a cat?
Hmm, first of all, shouldn't you get all the vaccinations?
Yeah, I have to take care of everything, Kiki
Kiki So then you have to think about the basic 50! The initial cost!
Oh, in the beginning? Then how much does it cost after a while?
Well, I think it depends on whether the child is sick or not!
Oh, this child seems healthy, Kiki
Kiki: Hmm, no, I don't know what happens between people and dogs!
Why are you like this? It's not me, it's Cat~
Oh right, Myo Kiki
Anyway, be prepared!
Yeah, I'm also preparing well ㅠㅠ
Oppa, is there any sport you've ever watched live at a stadium?
Ah, there's no viewing yet, Kiki
Are you gone?
Oh really?
I've been there~ You piece of shit~
Kiki, you're a moon person
How many times have you been there?!
Kiki I've been there twice Kiki
What is it Kiki
Is it really okay to call me a nerd?
Kiki why did I go twice!
Kiki, did you come back from the baseball game?
Kiki, I like baseball and soccer!
Oh, you went to the soccer game too?
I'm a little jealous of that, Kiki
Kiki and soccer were a huge hit,
But it was a draw ㅜ
I think that would be more exciting and fun?
Oh yeah, I had beer there too~
Wow, I want to drink beer at the stadium too Kiki
Kkkkkkkkkkk It was really thrilling~ So delicious~
But you're a drunkard... You can't drink Kiki
Oppa, what game do you often play with your friends?
I used to play karts with Star when I was young Kiki
Kiki is also a star~ Do you watch star videos too, oppa?
I've seen all those game competitions Kiki
Who was that other person with Kiki and Kong Jin-ho? Did you take care of that person's stuff?
Are you talking about Im Yo-han?
I've seen a lot of Kiki
Kiki, that's right, Kiki Im Yo-han ate all the stars!
Yeah he really was the best Kiki
That's right, Kiki Kong Jin-ho had no choice but to end up in second place.
But Kong Jin-ho is also very famous, right? Kiki
Kiki, that's right, Kong Jin-ho was really good too!
Yes, I'm good at it, but I'm going to lose when I meet Im Yo-han.
Kiki ah admit kiki
But I think Im Yo-han is a real genius!
And Kong Jin-ho's parents hated Im Yo-han so much, Kiki
Kiki, wow, awesome Kiki, did you say something like that?
I heard that on a variety show, but Kiki Kong Jin-ho said that
Oppa, what do you think is the fun of traveling?
Of course, it would be something like this, a landscape? Something to do?
Kiki scenery? Of course it's food!?
Isn't that the default option, Kiki?
Kiki Oh, really? I almost got a little sad~
Kiki, why are you going on a trip this time?
Kiki No, I'm not going right now. I'm just making plans~
Where are you planning to go?
I personally want to go to Busan right now, but my boyfriend wants to go to Jeju Island!
Oh, then Jeju Island is Kiki
Listen to the man on that one
Kiki, is that so ㅜㅜ
But when I'm in Seoul, I have to go to Busan to get some benefit!
Why? Why is Busan advantageous when you are in Seoul?
Kiki: No, you can take a plane from here!
Kiki How long does it take to get to Busan by plane? Kiki
Kiki I saw it and it was exactly one hour!
Oh, then that would really be beneficial, Kiki
Oppa, it was chilly last week. Don't you catch a cold?
Yeah, it doesn't work
I'm very strong
Wow, my throat is sore
I see you have a cold now, Kiki
Oh my god, I'm so annoyed, why is winter suddenly coming?
Oh, but the weather is nice today, Kiki
Kiki, that's right, it's not warm, but it's still loose!
Yeah, Kiki's mood swings are so severe right now
Kiki: Okay, I admit, but autumn will disappear now, right?
There is also a saying that spring and fall disappear Kiki
Kiki, wow, this is seriously so annoying ㅜㅜ
I like fall the best!
But there will be fall when we live, Kiki
Kiki, is that really so? Even now, autumn is disappearing,
No, it's fall again now, Kiki
No, it's not fall because the weather makes it difficult to wear my thin trench coat!
Oh, I guess you can tell the weather by the clothes you wear.
What do you think of a mother who asks if it's normal for her high school daughter to spend 110,000 won on food?
Hey, you're talking about 110,000 won a month for food?
Oh, that's right, the amount for dinner!
Isn't that a little too much?
That's why my daughter got scolded because she came out a lot just now.
No, I ate it well because I cared about it, so why did you scold me for that?
So, you should pack your own lunch or Kiki
You just scolded me a little with words, right? Kiki
Oh, but my daughter said she had no choice but to eat with her friends, so I posted this because I was curious.
Oh, so that's why that article became so popular?
Kiki Oh, so in the reply, my daughter said that she ate well and cheaply, and that the basic price for a meal these days is 8,000 won Kiki
Of course, for 8,000 won, my daughter ate frugally. Kiki
So, my child comes home from studying in the reading room until 11 o'clock every day ㅜㅜ
Wow, then I should make sure to eat more filling food.
That's right! And if you don't eat with the kids, you'll be left out!
Then the kids won't play with you and will bully you.
Wow, there's a Russian guy who sold his company when he was 17 and made 35 billion?
Wow, that kid is really smart.
So, isn't it amazing that you're a millionaire at 17?
So it's a jackpot
How did it end up like that?
He created an app that collects important news!
Oh, so that app was a success?
Oh, some company bought this app because they saw its future potential rather than its success!
Oh, so that's how much did you ask for before selling it?
Kiki, the company that bought it gave you 35 billion won!
Ah, so you said, &quot;I'll give you this much, so sell it&quot;?
Oh, I guess so
But this guy made another app and I think he'll make more money this time?
Wow, wow, what should people do? Kiki
Kiki That's right, but this guy just seems like a genius Kiki
It's on a different level from us,
Kiki, I guess I should learn how to make apps too
Oh right, but my head is already hardened, so it won't work~
Well, in the end, I guess I'll have to work hard as a salaried worker, Kiki
Oppa, don't you get your eyebrows tattooed?
I don't get my eyebrows tattooed Kiki
Kiki why are there so many people doing this these days
Yeah, I have friends who do that Kiki
Right, oppa, do you have a friend around you?
Kiki, there's a kid who's interested in that kind of thing
Oh really? There's a Kiki around me too.
There are a lot of kids who like that kind of thing, Kiki
Yeah Kiki one of my friends wears makeup too
Wow, that guy wears makeup too?
Kiki, you're better at makeup than me
But that's just a hobby, so you have to respect it Kiki
Kiki is right, she did it naturally and well
Kiki, go and learn how to make up later.
Kiki Oh, I should do that. I'm really bad at putting on makeup.
Kiki, come learn and dress up too Kiki
How much does it cost to go to the dentist, oppa?
Dentist? If you go once, won't you get 100%?
Kiki, are you still breaking 100?
I don't know because it's been a while since I've been there Kiki
But that's about it, Kiki
Kiki Oppa, if you still break like that, you should get insurance right away.
Hey, but the one I did before didn't pay for that
Kiki, what? Why don't you give it to me? I always give it to you.
No, he said he wouldn't give me the part I did before, Kiki
Kiki Wow wow there was something like that too!? Goosebumps
Oh, so I paid the money but I didn't get to ride a single one, so I cancelled it ㅡㅡ
Kiki wow wow I canceled because I don't have cavities and this is awesome
Oh, I was really mad because I felt like I wasted money.
Kiki Wow, awesome. But was that in the insurance policy?
I think so, Kiki
I don't think the staff there would lie to avoid giving it to you Kiki
Kiki, wow, that was a real waste of money.
Uh... You really need to look into insurance before you buy it, Kiki.
Oppa, do you use Coupang often?
Yeah I use Coupang a lot
Kiki, is your brother also a member there?
No, I haven't done that yet, Kiki
Oh really?
Then go to Naver Shopping
Kiki Most people search and buy Kiki on Naver
Kiki, right? If I sign up for Naver membership this time, there are benefits?
Is there something like that?
But it's annoying ㅠㅠ
Oh, no, why don't you just sign up?
Hey, what's the benefit of signing up for that?
If you do that, you'll get a huge discount and points!
How much do you have accumulated, Kiki?
Kiki, at some point I see 5,000 won piled up!
No, Naver originally gave me a lot of Kiki
Yes, Naver Shopping is much better than Kakao Pay.
Kakao, I know that, 1 won zoom Kiki
Oppa, are you still watching Infinite Challenge these days?
Infinite Challenge? Do that again?
No, I'm watching it again Kiki
Ah, what are you doing when you play? Kiki, I see a lot of people.
Kiki Oh, that's right, that's why you've been appearing a lot in YouTube videos lately~
Kiki, once it becomes an issue, people flock to it
Kiki, that's right, but it's so good because it shows up in the algorithm automatically
But sometimes I wonder why this kind of thing comes up. Kiki
Kiki right that's right I'm watching Love and War later Kiki
Love and War Kiki
What does that have to do with Infinite Challenge, Kiki?
Kiki, so you're saying that unknown algorithms are awesome?
But if you look at it, it seems like an algorithm that you can figure out Kiki
Kiki Hmm I don't know~
That and the video of Kiki suddenly pulling out his beard
Beard Plucking Video Kiki
Why does that come up, Kiki?
Kiki: So you saw it without me knowing?
I think that kind of thing is something that you get sucked into if you look closely, Kiki
What kind of cartoons are you watching these days, oppa?
I don't really read comics, do you?
Oh really? I'm a nerd, Kiki
Yes, you are a nerd
What are you watching right now Kiki
Kiki I'm watching Attack on Titan again right now
That was popular Kiki
What's the content?
Kiki, this has giants in it. Do you like cruel things, oppa?
no
I don't really like cruel and scary things Kiki
Kiki Ah, then you must never see this! Kiki, who eats people
Huh, you're eating people? That's so cruel...
Kiki, the giant is eating people, so fry him until he's covered in blood!
Oh then I don't want to see that Kiki
I want to see that one piece
Kiki, I'd rather watch One Piece
Oh, you know that's super popular, right?
Kiki, of course you are, of course you are, of course you know~~
If you don't know that, you're a spy.
I need to go on a Naruto rampage
I'm going to eat at my in-laws' house now~
Oh, your in-laws?
Are you eating Supreme? Kiki
Oh, this time I'm going to try Gold Supreme!
Oh, that's no different from the seasoning, Kiki
Oh really?
Have you ever eaten gold?
Oh, I tried it and there was no difference. Kiki
Oh, then what is that yellow sauce?
I don't know much about yellow sauce but there was no difference Kiki
Wow! That's a thousand won difference!?
Or did they give me the sauce without the sauce?
Kiki, don't you remember the yellow sauce?
Oh, I don't remember seeing anything like that, Kiki
Oh, then what I'm ordering is the one with yellow sauce!
Just in case, take a picture and send it to me Kiki
I ordered this as a whole and it costs 20,000 won!
It's a must-have
Easy to eat Kiki
Honey, I heard you got a loan this time?
How much did you get paid?
Oh, I have a loan this time.
I got 100 million Kiki
Oh my gosh, you got a small business loan?
Yeah, I got a mortgage with that, Kiki
Oh my gosh, how much interest do I have to pay?
I think it's around 1.2%? Kiki
Wow ㅜㅜ Then is it 1.2 million won?
I don't know yet because I haven't paid the interest yet Kiki
Oh my gosh ㅜㅜ I'm so sad
Don't ask me to lend you money!
Then can you lend me 100 million?
Kiki, no, not that much, but I could buy you a piece of furniture or something~
Hey, that's not a good idea Kiki
Just buy me one now
Kiki, what do you want?
say it!
Kiki, can you buy me a refrigerator?
Ah, is 20 liters enough for one man?
Are you telling me to just put water in there and live there, Kiki?
Oppa, if you move, how will you get to work?
If you move, you'll have to commute by car Kiki
It was convenient before because we had a company car.
I still have a company car
What's wrong Kiki
no
Should I call it a commuter bus instead?
that!
Ah, the commuter bus was nice Kiki
I can't help it ㅠㅠ
Kiki: So how many hours does it take from home to work?
But the distance is a bit closer, 30 minutes?
I think it'll take about that long Kiki
Oh my goodness
Before, it took over an hour to get to work by bus!
Oh, I think this is better Kiki
Kiki yeah
I'll fill up my car with gas too~
I don't know if the company will allow that Kiki
Kiki: Of course you should do that in secret~
If I get caught, it's embezzlement, Kiki
I'm scared, you coward
Kiki, your brother's liver is too small~
Your liver is too big
How are your relationships with your coworkers, oppa?
I'm not on bad terms with Kiki
Just so-so
The manager who quit last time fed my brother poop, Kiki
Oh, that guy was a bit weird Kiki
Kiki daebak
My brother got cursed at because of that guy!
Me? Did I get cursed at that time? Kiki
Oh, that guy didn't hand over the responsibility to you!
Oh right
I confused you with someone else Kiki
Have you ever done that?
Kiki, that's right!
That's why I got a lot of hate from my brother's business partner!
But I think it's like that everywhere when people change, Kiki
Huh, no
Still, the handover should have been done properly!
But if things go badly, there are a lot of people who do that on purpose to give you shit Kiki
Wow I'm really getting pissed
By the way, are you still in contact with that person?
I can't help it ㅠㅠ
no
I'm not with that guy right now Kiki
Kiki yeah
Don't contact me again, and if you do, spit on me!
There's nothing to do, but if you come, I'll ask you to buy me food Kiki
Have I seen a female soldier recently!?
Female soldier?
Did you happen to see it on the street?
Oh right Kiki
It was really amazing
You shouldn't be surprised!
Why are you curious about that, Kiki?
There are a lot of female soldiers these days~
Something about a woman wearing a military uniform makes her look cool!
Oh, but women say Kiki is cool when they see her
Kiki, really?
I guess female soldiers also undergo a lot of training?
right
The female soldiers also train a lot, Kiki
Wow, I heard that you have to study a lot to get into the military academy!?
Yes, you need to study well and have good physical strength Kiki
that's right
What kind of person is a female military academy student?
I'm curious!
Kiki I think Kiki is just a bit of a strong person
Kiki is right
I think so 1: When you went to the military, were there any female soldiers?
Oppa, were there any female soldiers when you went to the army?
Oh, I've seen female soldiers too, Kiki
Kiki, really?
Was it really cool when you saw it back then?
It was a long time ago so it felt cool, Kiki
amount to much
Oppa, do you want to form a band with me?
band?
Are you talking about Naver Band? Kiki
no
We too, do as the doctors do!
Oh I haven't seen that drama yet Kiki
Kiki, wow, awesome,
Moon Jin-i
Then, oppa, just go learn piano and come!
Hey, you might not see it
Kiki, you're so fat
I'm not good at piano either
Kiki, really?
Are you good at playing the piano?
Okay then Kiki
I'll learn electric guitar tomorrow!
I only learned piano for 6 years Kiki
Can you play the guitar?
Kiki: No, but I've played the guitar!
That's what I did, playing a song, hitting a person, Kiki
No, when I was in high school, there was a music practical test where you had to play the guitar. Kiki
Oh, you went to a really good school?
Kiki, but I got really pissed when you told me to hold the guitar weirdly!
Oh, did the teacher give you a wrong answer?
no,
The guitar is as big as my body and I'm told to hold it well, but I can't reach it!
Oh, right
The guitar is bigger than your body Kiki
What is your brother doing now?
Kiki, I'm working at a factory right now.
How long have you been there?
I think I've been going for about a year now?
Yeah, oppa, you said you worked long hours because you were in debt, right?
It's good to work hard, but it's sad to be in debt
Why did you pick a car because you liked it!
Still, it's good to have some experience!
right
Then you can receive retirement benefits and Kiki
Kiki, you know that retirement pay is really sweet, right?
That's a lot of money to pay, Kiki
Yeah Kiki
If your little brother can keep going, tell him to go!
Oh, I wish I could do that too, Kiki
You have to figure it out yourself
Kiki it's okay
I'll keep driving until I pay off my car debt!
no
I think they'll block it with severance pay again lol
Kiki oh my gosh Kiki
That won't do!
Never let me stop!
Kiki, will the dog listen to me?
My boyfriend is coming over now, but when will he arrive?
How long does it take to get there?
As far as I know, it takes an hour.
Oh, then I should order something delicious, Kiki
Kiki, that's why I ordered chicken Kiki
Oh, you said he was a huge fan of his wife's family?
Oh right Kiki
But would you like to eat boneless chicken feet too, Kiki?
Oh, brother, do you have a lot of sheep?
no,,
All food waste goes into my stomach~
Oh, you eat better, Kiki.
Kiki no
I have to eat it all up for a few days~
Oh my, that's a bit too much Kiki
We should eat together
So~
Last time, I bought a whole cake and left without eating it~
Just buy a piece of cake...
So~
But your heart is still pretty~
Kiki, you ended up taking your boyfriend's side
Oppa, did Merong eat the cake I made for you?
Oh, I told you to eat that and go crazy, Kiki
Kiki, oppa, you can eat that too~
no
I'm fine
I'll buy it Kiki
Kiki, that thing is made with pumpkin!
It's healthy food~
I don't even eat pumpkin very well Kiki
refusal
It also has pumpkin and sweet potatoes in it~
Can't you just buy me a pumpkin sweet potato?
Kiki, come to think of it, there was raw beef in it ^^
Can't you just buy it for me?
I don't want to eat with Kiki
Kiki yeah yeah
That's really expensive, so feed it to the baby!
That baby has already eaten everything, Kiki
Kiki, wow, you ate all that in one day?
No, I gave it to you in the morning and evening for two days lol
Thank goodness ㅜㅜ
That's quite a lot, so you have to adjust it!
that's right
So the baby pooped Kiki
Oppa, I heard you joined the baseball club this time?
Oh right
I joined a club once
Kiki, you don't collect membership fees?
There is no membership fee yet Kiki
It's my first time Kiki
Kiki, really?
Then how much should I give you next time?
Well, wouldn't it be around 50 thousand won?
Kiki, I see
So when do you start going?
I'll be leaving in about two weeks Kiki
Kiki do daebak
What time does it start?
After work, around 8 o'clock?
Oh, don't exercise clubs usually meet on weekends?
Sometimes I do it on weekdays too Kiki
If you like me
Oh, I saw that there was a place at the baseball stadium that had the lights on!
that's right
It's dark, but I think it's okay, Kiki
Kiki oh my gosh Kiki
I want to exercise too!
You too, come join the club Kiki
I'm going crazy this time hahaha
Why do you always get addicted to games?
Kiki, you're making me do this!
I'm so pissed!
What game are you into this time? Kiki
I have a cart app this time.
There it is!
cart?
Kiki, they said it was on mobile
Why there?
Oh right Kiki
I bought the item
I'm going to do an item sale!
Oh, you're doing an item battle instead of a speed battle?
Hey, but there's something to do with AI!?
Items to use there!
It seems a bit different than before, Kiki
It's completely different from the old days!
Uh, so how much did you spend? Kiki
Kiki, how much did I pay~
Guess it~
I think you would have done it for less than 200,000 won, Kiki
no
I'm not that skinny haha
Oh really?
How much did you do Kiki
Me Namhae German Village?
I want to go there!
South Sea?
Are you talking about the village at the end of the land?
Oh right
A place in Haenam!
Oh, I think the German village there is famous. Kiki
Oh, it was really famous there before!
What else is famous there? Kiki
Haenam is famous for sweet potatoes~
sweet potato?
Aren't sweet potatoes fat-free?
no
I heard Haenam Island is famous for its sweet potatoes?
I heard that spinach or bracken fern is famous
Aren't bracken ferns only found in the cold regions of Gangwon-do?
Oh, so you're talking about spinach?
I don't know Kiki
Kiki's German Village mask is really pretty in front of the sea!
Oh really?
I should check it out too lol
Kiki, you should go with your girlfriend too!
My girlfriend doesn't like traveling Kiki
Does your brother like stepping on fallen leaves?
Oh, puppies like that, Kiki
Kiki, no, does your brother like you?
Step on it!
I don't think it's bad either Kiki
Kiki, I'm telling you to go right away when you see fallen leaves!
Follow this!
Why on earth are you acting like that, Kiki?
Kiki, why can't you do it outside of that season!
Aren't you picking up money in between?
It's not Kiki
Wow, it would be awesome if I had money in that time!
My friend always looks at the coins among the fallen leaves Kiki
Kiki oh my gosh
I did that at the playground
Are you talking about that merry-go-round?
Kiki oh and the swing ride is really salty
Oh, I heard there are quite a lot there too, Kiki
Kiki and there are so many
I earned a thousand won then!
But these days, it seems like it won't be available because it's a card. Kiki
Did I tell you about the bottled water incident last time?
What water incident are you talking about?
An incident occurred where two people were seriously injured after drinking bottled water at work!
Oh, are you talking about that suicide case?
no
This isn't suicide. A male and female employee drank bottled water at the company and both went to the emergency room!
Wasn't that someone who took drugs?
Oh right
That guy bought the medicine that contained the poison that was found in these victims!
Yeah, so
And then they say he committed suicide
Oh right ㅜㅜ
So it's still not clear why that happened ㅜ
It seems like it's been a few days, but it still hasn't come out ㅠㅠ
Oh, but among the victims, the man eventually died.
Wow, awesome
I didn't know until I died ㅠㅠ
That's why ㅜㅜ
The woman is still unconscious!
That woman also seems a bit dangerous ㅠㅠ
ㅡㅜ I think it was done on purpose
That drug is not something that just anyone can buy!
Then where on earth did you get that?
Moderna has been a huge issue lately!
Oh right
There was a lot of talk about Moderna Kiki
But Moderna has a strong immune effect on children aged 6 to 11!
Oh really?
Then it would be good for young people?
right
But now, it's fatal for people in their early 20s!
Is it only bad for people in their early 20s?
No
Now they say that it is dangerous for young people from the age of 17, not just for little kids!
But aren't you a middle or high school student now?
no
Moderna has probably discontinued it as far as I know?
So are you all getting Pfizer?
Hey, America has already decided not to cater to young people!
Oh, so the young people in America all got it right?
Some people have already been hit, but they won't be hit anymore!
Moderna is the only one that doesn't work
Pfizer doesn't work either?
yes
I'm getting Pfizer instead of Moderna!
Ah, then young people will get Pfizer Kiki
Oppa, don't you put anything on your lips?
Yeah I don't really have anything special Kiki
really?
I'm so dry that I'm applying it ㅜ
Ah, women should do something, Kiki
Oh right
I bought some lip balm and am applying it!
So are you seeing any results?
Well, I don't know
He told me to put honey on it,
Honey? Is that good to apply?
It's like eating while applying
Kiki no
Honey goes straight into my stomach when I apply it
Eat garaetteok and dip it in honey Kiki
Oh, that's a really good idea.
There's a rice cake shop near my house!
Then you can eat something delicious and put honey on it, killing two birds with one stone Kiki
Kiki so sweet Kiki
But honey is expensive!
How much does honey cost now?
I don't know
That depends on the type of honey.
Ah, then buy something cheaper and do it Kiki
Didn't you say that your gums were really bad?
Oh right
My gums are sinking Kiki
Kiki, so oppa, all your roots will come out ㅜ
My gums are so bad I need treatment Kiki
Gum treatment hurts
That's because you brush your teeth too hard!
Kiki brushing teeth
It's the first time I've heard that after brushing my teeth, Kiki
Kiki why
Isn't that called brushing your teeth?
commonly?
no
This is my first time hearing about Kiki
If your gums are not in good condition, you can't get an implant Kiki
Kiki is so funny Kiki
Wow, awesome
Then, should I get dentures?
Oh right
So you need to treat it, Kiki
scared
Now that the number in front of Kiki is 3, everything is really broken~
Oh, it makes me so sad to hear that.
Kiki it's okay
Now that we've found it, we can treat it!
How much more will it hurt when it changes to 4 later Kiki
Kiki, that's right,
Your bones will hurt by then, right?
You too soon
Hook goes
Get ready, Kiki
Honey, did you receive what I sent you?
no
He hasn't arrived yet
What are you sending?
Wow, that's a fruit
Should I go quickly?
If it's fruit, shouldn't it arrive in one day?
Kiki, that's right
Oh, I guess it's because I ordered it last night!
Oh, then it will be shipped today and arrive tomorrow Kiki
Yeah, that's expensive, so eat it quickly!
Oh, thank you
I'll eat well
How much does it cost?
Oh, that box costs 100,000 won!
Wow, gold on fruit?
What the hell is that?
Oh Kiki, that one has apple mango and shine muscat in it!
Ah, Shine Muscat, that's really expensive, Kiki
Kiki, that's right
Last time, they asked for 40,000 won for two flowers!
But did you know that one flower costs less than ten thousand won?
Oh my god, that was so bad,
Last time I went to the post office and got 2 flowers for 50,000 won.
Wow, that's crazy expensive
Kiki really leaves a lot of food
Wow, oppa, you watched High Kick when you were in high school?
Oh, then there's no one who hasn't seen that, Kiki
oh my god
It's back again this time!
Oh right, I saw that on the internet, Kiki
This is awesome ㅜㅜ
I really liked it, but this time, Seo Min-jeong is coming out!
Oh right
Seo Min-jeong is coming out, and I think Park Min-young is coming out too?
Oh right Kiki
It looks like everything is going to be great ㅜㅜ
I'm most looking forward to that pumpkin sweet potato shoutout
Kiki, I saw what Mrs. Namunhee did. It was so much fun. Kiki
Do you know the exact date?
No, it only appeared briefly on YouTube, so I don't know the details yet!
I still don't know the information ㅠㅠ
Kiki I'll let you know later when I watch YouTube!
that's right
You watch a lot of YouTube, you watch it and tell me Kiki
Kiki Oki
But as we all get older, it's kind of sad ㅜ&quot;
Oh but Mrs. Moon Hee is still the same, it's amazing
Oppa, do you have a favorite movie star?
I really like Shin Se Kyung Kiki
Kiki, oh my gosh I like it too
I also watched Tazza 2 recently!
Oh but that's not fun Kiki
Oh really?
I had so much fun watching it!?
Maybe because I enjoyed Tazza 1 so much, it wasn't as good as I expected Kiki
Ah, when compared to Tazza, but when I just watched it as a movie, it was really fun!
But it seems like it's not enough to beat 1
So Kiki
But since One Eyed Jack appears in Tazza 2, they say it's fun too.
Oh, are you talking about Tazza 3?
I didn't even see that Kiki
Oh, that's the one with Lee Kwang-soo and Ryu Seung-beom!
I'm sorry to Kwangsoo hyung, but it's already been rumored that it's not fun.
Kiki Oh me too but I haven't seen Tazza 3
That's why it's not fun Kiki
right
I told you not to look like that, Kiki
I'll see you on TV Kiki
I like Kiki
But it doesn't seem like it will be on TV
There's an extreme job, Kiki
Hey, Kiki, you'll be on TV someday
Extreme job is the best
Oppa, what is your favorite flavor of ice cream?
I like vanilla the best Kiki
Kiki, really?
Me too Kiki
When I was little, chocolate was the best!
that's right
I liked chocolate when I was little too Kiki
Kiki, right
At that time, I didn't taste anything other than chocolate.
Chocolate is the best
Strawberry doesn't even look at Kiki
Kiki me too
But now avocado tastes so good~
Oh, I don't think that's very good, Kiki
Kiki, really?
I don't like coffee, but I like this!
Oh, that?
I thought I was talking about something else for a moment Kiki
Kiki what
Are you talking about fruit?
that's right
That's what I'm talking about
I can't remember the name Kiki
Oh, I'm talking about that green, tasteless thing!
that's right
That's tasteless Kiki
Kiki, I thought you said that
Kiki, you put that in salad!
Yeah Kiki
People eat that a lot
Honey, is the house you live in now rented?
no
I live with my parents now Kiki
Oh, I see
Then, the house would be yours now, right?
Yeah, my parents...
It's not my car Kiki
Kiki is right,
When are you planning to become independent?
Kiki, we won't be together until we get married.
Kiki Oh, you don't have anyone to marry, so you'll be there for a while?
that's right
You can live with your parents for the rest of your life
Kiki Ai, not to that extent
I'll introduce you later~
okay
Please introduce me to someone Kiki
Kiki, I understand
But how old were you, oppa?
I'm 28 now Kiki
Exactly like you guys
Kiki Wow, that's right Kiki
Brother, then get me a house.
I'll get you a real girl!
Then, if I just have a house, I'll get married
Kiki, a man just needs to find a nice house!
that's right
I'll do everything, so just come, Kiki
Oppa, didn't you say you paid the fine last time?
I think that's what happens every day, Kiki
Kiki, wow, my older brother says he does it all the time
No, I really don't think the Navi update is working Kiki
Kiki, surely it's not Genie Navi?
Kiki, that's not it
That's really lame
Kiki right that's really awesome that's Kiki
Bro, what kind of navigation is this?
Am I Artran?
Free Navi Kiki that I have been using for a long time
First time hearing about Kiki
You might as well install T-map!
But since it's something I used before, it's easier to see Kiki
Wow, instead of being comfortable, you're paying the country a fee? Kiki
Kiki Ah, I hear that, so I guess I'll have to switch Kiki
Kiki: So, how much is the late fee you pay every month, oppa!?
I think I'm around 20-30 Kiki
Wow, awesome, brother, change the navigation right now.
Uh... I guess so
I'll change it next week or so Kiki
What was the worst part-time job your brother ever had?
I really find serving meat at a restaurant hard Kiki
Wow, my brother also flies charcoal?
Oh, of course Kiki
I'm going to change the grill too
Wow, awesome
Does your brother do the dishes too?
no
There was someone else who did that Kiki
Oh my gosh ㅜㅜ
Oppa, you must have sweated a lot then.
This is really the worst
I even did the first step in front of the fire Kiki
Kiki oh my gosh
If it's the first time, will my brother grill the meat for me?
Yeah, I'll bake it first and then take it out.
Wow, awesome
Oppa, you even do that for me?
Yeah, you have to keep grilling it in front of the fire, Kiki.
Kiki oh my gosh
Do the customers there have to tip?
But there was no one to give it to Kiki
Wow, awesome
Shouldn't the customer be the one to provide that and the owner be the one to take better care of it?
no
At that time, I just worked for the lowest wage Kiki
When you were in the military, did your friends come to visit you?
Yeah, I have a lot of friends here, Kiki
Kiki, where did you get your assignment at that time?
I came out to Incheon at that time Kiki
Incheon?
Then the kids will definitely go
Yeah, there are a lot of places to play there, so I came and played. Kiki
that's right
I also went to Incheon Chinatown Kiki
I don't know where Kiki went, I was just jealous of Kiki
Kiki dog laugh
How many times have your friends come to visit you, brother?
I think I've been here about six times, Kiki
I don't remember very well
I see
Oppa, what did you usually do when you got your vacation?
I mostly met the kids, drank, and played Kiki
Digging Kiki
Oppa, did you say you didn't have a girlfriend at that time?
Oh, so you played a lot with your friends, Kiki
Kiki Oh, I guess all your friends are good people~
Everyone went to the military at that time and met up and talked to each other.
Oppa, don't you want to learn things like electric guitar?
Wow, awesome
Are you cool? Kiki
no
I want to play drums Kiki
Oh, drums?
Someone I know is learning that too Kiki
Oh really? Kiki
No, let's learn and form a band.
Hey it's not me Kiki
I'm far from arts and physical education Kiki
Kiki Ah, then isn't there anyone around you who is good at singing?
There are quite a few singers around me Kiki
Oh my gosh Kiki
Let me introduce myself. Let's make our band!
okay
Then I guess I'll have to tell my friend to do it as a hobby Kiki
Kiki, then you can be our manager
Manager Kiki
I'm going to die from driving all day Kiki
Kiki, you have to set a schedule for me too~
We're going to be busy~
Then I'll take care of everything and give you the money
Kiki, no!
Accidents can't happen!
Kiki, who just had a minor accident and is taking a break
Oppa, doesn't your family have a family chat room or something?
We have a house but we don't talk to each other Kiki
really?
Same goes for us
Kiki, we only celebrate each other's birthdays
that's right
Kiki celebrates birthdays but doesn't really say anything
Kiki, we're even 13 people and nobody talks
Wow, what kind of big family are you guys?
no
Kiki, a chat room with my cousins
Wow, you guys all seem to get along really well, Kiki
Oh, I think so, Kiki
Instead there is no word
What is it Kiki
In the end, it's just a chat room where no one says anything, Kiki
Oh right Kiki
Now is the time when I really have a lot to say, when I say New Year's greetings Kiki
Oh, right
I'll talk a lot on holidays and such, Kiki
Kiki is right
But we all just sleep during the holidays
Kiki eat and sleep, eat and sleep, it's all like that Kiki
Kiki is right
Wake up, eat, sleep, wake up, eat fruit, sleep, Kiki
You really start drinking at lunchtime, Kiki
When was your last relationship?
My last relationship was a month or two ago?
Oh my gosh ㅜㅜ Did you say that you were a car owner back then?
Oh, right...
I'm a bad kid who got ripped off for a lot of money...
Kiki, did you say you got ripped off 30 to 50 times that time?
Yeah Kiki
Now that I think about it, I wonder why I did that Kiki
Kiki, no, I'll give you the account number, so write it down.
No you don't need an account Kiki
No one gives it to me anymore
Kiki, yeah,
It's better for you to collect it yourself rather than giving it to me!
Gather!
Now I'm going to save that money
Yeah, that's a good idea.
Then buy a house and meet a good woman!
Then you guys I'll be waiting Kiki
Kiki: Then I'll make time for you sometime soon!
Hey, can you give me a seat, Kiki?
Kiki Oki Oppa, do you have time in November?
Oh, then feel free to leave time anytime~
Oppa, I don't want to raise a turtle
turtle?
turtle?
Why are you suddenly talking about turtles Kiki?
Kiki the turtle
I want to raise one, but my family can't raise one, so Kiki
I can't raise it either
Kiki, I'm not confident
It's not Kiki
This guy is great if you just get the temperature right!
Then you can raise it ㅠㅠ
Why are you doing this to me~
Kiki no
I want to raise one, but the conditions are not right
Oppa, you can do it!
No, I can't because I lack responsibility Kiki
Kiki, then there's nothing I can do
Then, oppa, is there any animal you would like to raise?
I like looking at animals, not raising them. Kiki
Then raise fish
fish!
fish?
That also needs a lot of cleaning
I hate Kiki
Kiki no
Just buy a small fish tank and raise them~
But if you're going to raise it, you should raise it well Kiki
Kiki: Then, oppa, is there any fish that you're interested in?
Don't all fish raise guppies?
Oppa, is the Olympics coming this spring?
I saw it, but I didn't see it that well, Kiki
Why are men only good at soccer and board games!
I watch soccer, but I don't really watch other sports. Kiki
I see
This time I saw it
gymnastics!
gymnastics?
Was that at this Olympics too?
Oh right
I saw that gymnastics and it was really cool.
I should watch it later too Kiki
Medal sweat?
Kiki, I got it!
That first journey?
Player Yeo Seo-jeong!?
Do you know him?
Oh I know that guy Kiki
I saw the video uploaded
Oh right
She is the daughter of a gold medalist!
that's right
That edited one out really hurts, Kiki
Kiki is right ㅜㅜ
And it also appeared in What Do You Do When You Play?
Oh really?
I'll have to look for that and see Kiki
Oh, click click on the YouTube video~
Then Kiki, you have to look at that again
Oppa, have you tried playing the Brumbull game?
Oh, I did that a lot when I was little, Kiki.
I have Marvel Kiki from all the apps
Kiki I've been there too Kiki
Kiki and that guy, I saw a YouTuber who made 200 million won!
Wow, how about that much real estate?
I don't know
But everyone's Marvel is ultimately a game of chance Kiki
Yeah, but they say you win more if you do it right, Kiki
Kiki A admits
Of course, those who are smart should benefit!
right
But it's a bit unfair, Kiki
Why why?
How much did you earn, oppa?
I have 500 thousand won?
I did this much but I lost often Kiki
Wow Kiki, is that how much you spend in a month?
Oh, I've been to that extent in a month, Kiki
Kiki and daebak kiki
Oppa, give me that money!
no
Why do you ask for money no matter what I do?
Oppa, have you ever been to Tongyeong?
Oh, there's a famous ride there, Kiki
I haven't been there
Kiki, really?
I went there this time~
Oh, how is it there?
Was it good? Kiki
Oh my gosh, this is so good ㅜㅜ
The ocean is just awesome!
That would have been really nice, Kiki
How long have you been playing?
Kiki, I went for 2 nights and 3 days!
Oh, is 2 nights and 3 days enough to have fun?
Kiki, but personally, I can easily get a month's worth if I have the money.
A month?
I guess it was really nice there, Kiki
Oh really
I really like the ocean!
There is no one who hates the sea
How about the mountain?
no
The mountain is not that great because there are a lot of bugs~
Kiki why is it good to be healthy
Go hiking
Kiki no u
I went hiking and threw up last time~
Kiki, why don't you go and eat some pajeon with makgeolli Kiki?
Do you like looking at stars, oppa?
star?
It's been a long time since I've seen that, Kiki
Kiki, where do you live now?
I live in Nonsan now Kiki
If it's Nonsan, you'll still be able to see the stars, right?
But I don't lift my head because I'm looking at the stars, Kiki
Kiki Oki
Kiki I like looking at stars so I'm going to go look~
To see the stars?
So are you going to Gangwon-do to play? Kiki
Kiki no
This time I'm going to Anseong!
Anseong?
Is there a place to see the stars? Kiki
He said there was one
You can also see flowers during the day!
Did you make a stargazing spot in the flower viewing area?
Oh, so
But I think people are going to explode lol
Kiki, when there's no one around, choose wisely and play a game of wits Kiki
Kiki Ha, you absolutely have to go on a weekday!
Oh, I have to use my monthly salary and go play Kiki
Wow, awesome
Someone got vaccinated 4 times Kiki
Oh, can you give me permission to do number 4?
Should I tell you how it turned out?
Are you curious~?
Yeah I'm curious now Kiki
Tell me what it is
This guy got hit twice when he went to the US and got hit twice when he came back to Korea. Kiki
Why did that guy get hit so many times?
This person used to travel a lot for business!
But don't most people think that getting hit twice is the end?
Oh, but you said you came back to Korea and got it twice in the US, do you have the certificate of issuance?
He didn't give it to me
What? So you were forced to hit me twice more?
Is he okay?
Oh, Kiki, I'm living well without any symptoms.
That's a relief, Kiki
But where is something like that
Dangerously - -
therefore
This person had to keep going on business trips, but since Korea wouldn't issue him with a certificate, he couldn't go on business trips and just got hit twice more.
Wow, that guy must have been really anxious when he got hit ㅠㅠ
Right ㅜㅜ
So I guess that's why you're suing me?
right
Even if it were me, I'd be angry because it's dangerous
Carcinogen found in Malaysian national snack!
There are a lot of companies playing around with national items these days ㅡㅡ
But it's a national snack ㅜㅜ
I think it would be so shocking!
This isn't the imported snack we know, is it?
Oh right
I saw the cover and it's a snack I've never seen before!
Oh, that's good, Kiki
I would have been annoyed if I had eaten it
Kiki, this snack looks a bit like a nougat cracker
Who's Cracker?
Is that a popular snack in Taiwan?
Yeah, that's right
It has chewy caramel inside!
They say it tastes good if you microwave it a little bit Kiki
Oh right Kiki
I absolutely love that!
I tried that once too and it was delicious ㅠㅠ
Kiki, I admit
But it's a Malaysian snack, and they announced in Hong Kong that a carcinogen was detected? Kiki
Oh, you didn't find out because it was strange in Hong Kong? Kiki
Kiki, did you do any inspection on imported snacks from Hong Kong?
Oh, so that's what it was about, Kiki
How do you dress, oppa?
I just wear whatever I want
Kiki, aren't you interested in fashion?
I'm wearing a t-shirt with pants Kiki
Kiki Oppa, wear some branded clothes,
Hey, all my clothes are brand name. Why is that...
Kiki, are you sure?
What brand is it?
Tell me~
I wear a lot of street brands and Nike Kiki
Hey Nike is okay~
Oppa, do you like wearing hats?
no
I don't wear hats much Kiki
Kiki: Then what about accessories?
Aren't you going to do it?
That's annoying, what can I do? Kiki
Kiki: Then, oppa, just wear jeans and a t-shirt?
I think of my cousin,
Why does your cousin dress so well?
Yeah, just dress like a human being.
No
If you're like me, Pappy Pappy Kiki
Does your brother get a lot of cavities?
I had a lot of them when I was young, Kiki
Not now
Thank goodness Kiki
I don't have it anymore either!
Kiki, they say that when you become an adult, you won't get cavities easily.
that's right
I'm maintaining it now, but I have to go to the dentist!
My tooth hurts. Do I need root canal treatment too?
no
My gold crown fell out!
Oh, then I have to do that again ㅠㅠ
Oh right
But this is only 250,000 won
Are you kidding me?
Isn't it cheap?
Isn't it just over 300 thousand won?
no
Instead of refinishing it with gold, I'll just do it normally.
It doesn't make much difference, but it's made of gold so it's sturdy.
It's not Kiki
Since it's a spot that shows when you smile, I was just going to make it white ^^
Oh, then you can't get in with gold, Kiki
Kiki, that's right
It's white and 250,000 won is so sweet~
Okay then
They say there is no difference these days, but it's cheap there~
Did your brother say he uses 11st?
Yeah, that and Auction Gmarket and stuff like that
Wow, it's been a really long time since I've been to Gmarket
But don't you use Coupang a lot these days?
that's right
I've heard a lot of people use Coupang, but I don't use it often.
Then, where do you usually write?
Just search on Naver and you'll find the cheapest one
Wow goosebumps
The benefits of Naver Shopping right now are no joke!
Oh really?
What are the benefits there?
Is there a Naver account there?
If you make that, you'll get a discount when you shop!
Oh, what? So you're telling me to open a bank account, Kiki?
Kiki, that's right
But if you're going to keep using Naver, that's better!
When did you make that Kiki
I can't do it because it's annoying Kiki
Wow~
okay
Don't do it~
Kiki, later you will join me~
Kiki: Hmm, then do I have to enter my shipping address?
Ah, it would be a hassle to enter the delivery address too.
Don't do it Kiki
Oppa, do you know what a crime scene is?
This is so much fun!?
What is that? I'm hearing it for the first time Kiki
Oh really?
This is a mystery entertainment game, Kiki
reasoning?
Is that the feeling of the great escape, Kiki?
Oh right Kiki
That's Kang Ho-dong and who else is in it!
Oh, there, Yoo Byung-jae, Pio, and Shindong are appearing. Kiki
Kiki, that's right
And Fio is also coming out, right?
Oh, it came out last time
Not coming out now?
Isn't that season over now?
I think I said I'd do that again
Haven't done it yet?
Kiki, I don't think you've done it yet
Didn't that come out until season 8 now?
I don't know what season it is Kiki
Have you seen it often?
Kiki, I absolutely love you~
Kim Dong-hyun is also very funny, Kiki
He was secretly cute
Oh, that's right
Is that person coming out too?
Yeah Kiki but she's really scared and a coward
If I go to the movies with my girlfriend, who will pay for the movie ticket?
Of course, it's not something I should pay for?
Wow, awesome
It's awesome
I asked my boyfriend to buy me food Kiki
Oh, you're such a cool woman.
You're doing well
Kiki but food is more expensive
commonly!
But when I watch a movie, I think about popcorn and stuff... Kiki
Kiki, we don't eat popcorn or anything like that!
Then you don't even drink beverages and just watch movies?
Oh, if you drink a beverage, you'll feel better~
No~
How can you not drink while watching this movie Kiki?
Kiki no
I don't drink Kiki
My bladder is very small
How often do you go to the bathroom, Kiki?
Kiki: Well, if you have a diuretic feeling, you absolutely have to go!
Kiki, you'll need to get that treated later
Kiki, I think so too,
Take care of yourself in advance when you're young, Kiki
Hey, your little brother said he was coming out this time!
Yeah but it got cut off because of corona!
As expected, Corona is the best of the best, Kiki
That's what happens, but he'll be discharged soon.
Wow, is it that time already?
I'm so scared of what I'm saying Kiki
But when was his original vacation day?
Um, wait a minute, I thought it was around mid-August?
So you were calling people at the end of July?
Oh right Kiki, you're really wide-eyed
So they sell liquor there too, Kiki
You became a businessman just like your dad!
Still doing well!
That's right, I gained weight quickly ㅠㅠ Oh my!
Hey, why did he gain weight after going to work out? ㅜㅜ
Still, I exercise hard
It's coming out soon, so let's take a look together!
Did you do well on your test this time?
No, I was completely robbed...
It was too difficult
What kind of test was that?
Do you know that this is a Camco intern interview test?
What? Is there such a test?
Kiki, public corporations are hiring interns for the second half of the year
Can you even call that a test?
Yeah, an interview is a test too!
It was so hard ㅠㅠ
Ha, it's the hardest interview test in my life ㅜㅜ
When I tried to speak in front of Ai, my mouth wouldn't open
Does AI look like a human?
Oh no it's just a program Kiki
Then where should I report it?
Just look at the computer camera and say it!
Wow, they really said it was the era of the 4th industrial revolution, Kiki
I really hope that sticks!
Did you say your little dad had an accident?
Oh right, there was a car accident. What the heck~
So you said you were hospitalized at that time?
Yeah, that's right, I was lying down for about 3 days ㅜㅜ
Oh, is this true? ㅜㅜ
Were you in a lot of pain?
No, that's not it. It's nylon.
Nylon, it's been a long time since I've heard that word!
It can't be helped since it's 100% the other party's fault~
What is the age range of your opponent?
Are you a beginner at driving?
Oh, you're so cute~
I'm a beginner at driving.
Was the other person a man, a woman, or young?
Kiki, how can a man have such an accident?
What kind of car did that guy drive?
Ray, but the front bumper is gone? What the...
Kiki, isn't that the type of car that just falls over when you're Ray?
Still, we reached a good agreement
Kiki nice!
Hey, how's your boyfriend doing?
Wow, I can only sigh!
The day before yesterday was still 400 days
Wow, it's already been 400 days for you guys?
That's right, time really flies Kiki
How did you two meet?
I met Kiki as a travel companion on my trip to Europe.
How old was he when he went on a trip to Europe?
You must be amazing, you came here right after graduating at 20!
Wow, but the travel expenses must be a lot. Where did you get the money?
I think my parents gave it to me as a graduation present
I envy Kiki
Wow, I'm so jealous of the bourgeoisie
I haven't been there either ㅜㅜ
I think I was with him for about two weeks
Hey, did your travel routes overlap like that?
Yeah, we discussed and planned it!
Wow, I guess we liked each other from then on. Yoohoo~
Oh my! My big picture got caught~
There's one thing I'm curious about.
Yeah, what is that, honey?
Where does little Daddy get those Pungsan dogs from?
Oh, I know someone who runs a dog training center!
Oh my goodness, you're not doing it now?
Um... well I'm not sure?
You just said that Pungsan dog has purebred dogs!
Oh, that's right! The trainer from Animal Farm gave me a present, Kiki.
Oh my gosh, is this the person I know?
Yeah, that's right, I think so!
Wow, what a great incident! But our Jin broke the leash and ran away ㅜㅜ
As expected, our Jin yearned for freedom, Kiki
Did you know there's a dog farm near my house?
Oh my god, what should I do?
Weren't you dragged away?
Have you looked around?
At that time, the news was telling us to be careful because there were a lot of dog thieves. ㅜㅜ
Oh my, it's our Jin Oh my, it's our Jin
What exercise have you been doing recently?
I went hiking!
Have you ever climbed Mt. Gwanak?
Where is Mt. Gwanak?
Is that a mountain in Gwanak-gu?
It's near my sister's house, Kiki
Oh, thanks for the great info!
I won't go like that.
You're so decisive.
Do you know how clean the air is?
Whenever I go hiking, I get really dizzy.
No, that's because I didn't eat kimbap in the middle.
Oh no, I should have brought kimbap! My fault!
Kimbap eaten at the top of a mountain is so delicious~
What kind of kimbap did you bring, Mr. Kimbap?
Tuna kimbap with Yukgaejang bowl noodles is really delicious
Wow, but where did you get the hot water?
I took it in a thermos Kiki
Is it okay?
Oh really? That's how you cook the noodles?
Even though I went on a cold day, it was still cooked well!
Let's go eat together next time
What game did you play last?
I love overwatch so much
Kids these days are crazy about shooting games!
Sister, what games do you play?
You're not going to tease me, are you?
Oh, then what does my sister do?
I'm Ryumi Cube haha, we did it last time!
When was that the enemy~
I'm still doing it, oh my~
Hey, it hasn't even been that many months yet!
Overwatch is so much fun these days. Have you ever tried it?
I just watched Overwatch on YouTube
I can't do that ㅜㅜ
Yeah? When was the last time you went to a PC room?
First of all, the reason I went recently was to get my resume picked.
Oh no! It's a game at the PC room~
But I can't go these days because of Corona~
No, there are curtains
Let's go together next time!
As a travel veteran, is there any travel destination you would recommend?
I recently went to Busan and it was nice.
Hana, I've never been to Busan before ㅜㅜ
Oh really? Go with your boyfriend next time.
I really want to eat the pork noodle soup and wheat noodles you posted ㅜㅜ
The noodles were really tasty
Kiki, the king of the land, is on the rise
Wow, I've never even eaten meat before ㅜㅜ
The food is delicious, but there are also some nice tourist attractions nearby.
Yeah, if you go to a place like that, you should also go to the tourist map.
Recommend it!
Just having a beer while watching the night view of Gwangan Bridge is not enough
Wow, I want to go to a place like that and get my bearings!
When can I use my annual leave, sister?
The number of years doesn't matter, I'll save it for later!
Oho~ Save it well, I'll take it away ^^
Huh? You're saying such scary things?
We should go on a trip with our family!
Did it rain all day in your neighborhood yesterday?
No, I was just coming and going
How is it there now?
First of all, I don't know because I don't go outside.
Go outside, Jipsoon...
Kiki, I don't know what the weather is like
It's the weekend, what should I do? ㅜㅜ
I went to a cafe and met my boyfriend!
My boyfriend is busy so he can't meet me ㅜㅜ
Oh, then I have no reason to go out!
It's windy and cool these days
So, that's why I'm going to go out later!
Where are you going?
Wear long sleeves when you go out
It's cold, Kiki
Just a cafe in front of my house haha
The only place I went to was a cafe in front of me...
I'm going out with great courage!
Yeah, applause for your great courage...
Yes, I'm also planning on having a half-shot cafe latte!
Yeah, eat well
It's the changing of seasons these days, so be careful not to catch a cold~
Did you see the article this time?
Yeah I saw it
Motorcycle accidents are so bad these days.
Hey, did you see that video?
Yeah, that's right. I couldn't even open my eyes.
Yeah, that was so gross ㅜㅜ
I feel so bad for both drivers
So what happened to the family of the person who rode the motorcycle? ㅜㅜ
That's why motorcycles are really dangerous
Your brother rides a motorcycle, doesn't he?
Then~ Kiki doesn't even have a driver's license
How did he live his life Kiki
Sister, that kid is the one who fails the written test. Kiki
Yeah, as long as you're nice, that's fine.
Yeah, I just want him to be healthy...
Yes, health is the best for everyone!
Yeah, take care of your health!
Have you seen the Afghan kids coming into Korea this time?
Yeah, I saw that you said you were going to Jincheon~
Oh, you said you were going there?
I haven't seen that~
Kiki, it can accommodate about 380 people
Great our country
Most of the kids said they came!
That's right, that's why I gave her a doll as a gift!
The kids are hugging it tightly ㅠㅠ
Yeah, I saw that picture and it was kind of sad and cute ㅜㅜ
I know the kids might be scared, but I hope they adapt well to our country...
How scary would it be to be away from your parents and in a foreign country? ㅜㅜ
Well, we'd love to help if we can!
But did you see the comments there?
Yeah, that's so selfish
People are bad
Right, don't you remember that America helped us when we were having a hard time!
They say that a nation that forgets its history has no future.
Hey, you look cool when you talk about famous quotes!
If others help us, we should help them in return!
The last time I saw you, your hairstyle was pretty~
Yeah, I just cut my hair cool
What is the name of that hairstyle?
They say it's a medium bob cut, but doesn't it just look like a beggar's bob?
No, it was really pretty
Is that a hush cut?
No, it's a layered cut.
I'm glad it suits you!
A lot of people are getting layered cuts these days, huh?
I guess that's the trend~
How's your hair these days, sister?
I feel like I'm from the Joseon Dynasty now.
Oh my gosh~ How long has it been since I last went to the hair salon?
I went there in April this year and my hair grew quickly.
I see! You don't dye or perm your hair?
I mastered that two years ago~
Right, back then, your sister's hair was really nice to look at Kiki
Looking at old photos, I was so dazzling Kiki
Yeah, I miss those days
Let's go to the hair salon next time!
Are you feeling sick these days?
I can't poop in the morning these days
Hey you too? Hey me too! I guess it's because I'm getting older. ㅜㅜ
Now is the age where we can start taking probiotics
I even take probiotics and other things?
What else do you eat?
Let me know too!
I'm taking vitamins and magnesium!
Magnesium is said to be really good for eye twitching!
Did it work?
That's right, I bought it because I was so nervous when I came into the company ㅜㅜ
Oh my, my eyes start to twitch when I work so much ㅜㅜ
My body has completely changed into a low quality one ㅜㅜ
Really? Then supplements are essential.
Eat well
Yeah, that's why my desk is full of medicine boxes Kiki
Eat well too
They say food is medicine
Yeah, but I eat one meal a day.
I'll buy you food
Come out right now!
Did you know I put cosmetics on Carrot Market?
What is Carrot Market?
Is this the first time you've heard of that? Is it a mart?
You little kid, don't you know about Carrot Market?
I guess I'm fat Kiki
What are you doing?
I'm dealing with the locals!
Ah~ It's not a delivery transaction but a direct transaction?
Oh, but you can also do a courier transaction by talking to the other party!
Oh it's okay Kiki
But isn't it scary?
What if he runs away with the money?
So, I tell them to bring cash if possible!
Oh... You're not transferring money?
Yeah, that can be done too, but I prefer cash if possible!
Oh, I see. What cosmetics did you sell?
You didn't sell mine without me knowing, did you?
No way~ I bought it at Olyoung, but there was a lot so I uploaded one~
If you have something like that, why are you selling it to me?
No~ The place you live is far away~
That's right, Carrot Market is useful Kiki
I didn't know, but Park Bo-gum went to the military?
Oh my, when was the last time you left~ My brother is working so hard ㅠㅠ
Yes, I heard he went to the Navyㅜㅜ
Yeah, did you see the picture?
The conquest suits you well, Bogum
Hey, people said Park Bogum is handsome.
Now you know, look at that Kiki
I thought I was watching some military drama Kiki
He was really handsome
I only saw one, but do you have more?
Share it!
It comes up a lot in Naver articles
Park Bo-gum is definitely the best!
Usually, when you look at celebrities' military photos, they look like ordinary people, but Park Bo-gum is a real celebrity. Kiki
Oh, right. Ok Taecyeon is also famous for his military photos. Have you seen them?
I haven't seen Ok Taecyeon, but is he in the Navy?
No, I think he went to the army
My physical has improved!
If you were in the army, you must have been wearing moss. Did you get discharged?
I think you've been discharged? I see you on TV a lot these days.
Oh really? I didn't know because I don't watch TV these days~
Watch some TV and live, sis ㅠㅠ
What is your favorite movie?
I saw Tenet last year and it's my favorite movie?
What about your sister?
Is there a movie called Tenet?
Oh, typo ㅠㅠ It's a movie that came out last year!
Ah, Tenet is the title of the movie.
What genre is it?
This is a science fiction movie
Sister, did you see this?
No, if it's SF, you should watch Victory Ho
Our lovely Jungki!
Oh, that's already taken over, Kiki
Yoo Hae-jin is so funny
Yeah, all the kids are cute
But who's in Tenet?
I don't know the actor very well, but the director is the director of Interstellar.
I guess the director loves science fiction~
Yeah, I think so. It's a similar genre, but they're all different. Kiki
I should take a look on my day off too!
Yeah, I recommend watching it in IMAX at the theater!
What is iMax? Moonjin is crying, dirt.
Ask for expensive tickets at the movie theater! Kiki
I ate spicy stir-fried chicken yesterday. What did you eat?
Ah~ I made and ate jjambbong
Wow, how do you make Jjamppong?
Oh, I saw the recipe on Naver yesterday and made it.
Can you share that recipe with me?
Oh, of course
Should I tell you now?
Yeah, what ingredients do I need to prepare?
I always buy a lot of squid, shrimp, and vegetables at the supermarket!
Isn't squid expensive these days?
Well, my mom bought it so I don't know either
Oh, did you eat with your mom?
Oh, I ate with my family.
It must have tasted even better because I ate it with my family!
Oh, then it was really delicious
Next time I come over, make me some Jjamppong!
Okay, let's do that unconditionally
What happened to the house you lived in last time?
I came down home because my contract expired
Didn't you get off in the middle?
Oh, that's what happened, it worked out well
Oh, there was an incident at your house last time!
Oh, that was absolutely horrible
Yeah, it wasn't a big deal back then!
I thought I was going crazy
How much was the monthly rent for the house you lived in?
The house I lived in was probably 50 years old
Is it 50 including management fee?
It turned out like that, including everything.
Still, it's cheap considering the price of houses in Seoul!
Yeah, yeah, if you think about it that way, then yes, that's true
Right, that's right. Did you say it was a one-room apartment?
Oh yeah that's right it's a studio
What do you ride home?
I take the bus home
What is the bus interval?
I think the interval between trains is about 10 minutes.
You're getting home faster than I thought!
Yeah, that's right, the bus comes often.
Are there a lot of people on the bus?
Oh, even though it's corona, there were quite a lot of them
The interval between buses to our Nonsan house is 20 minutes!
Oh, it's really harder than I thought
Yes, all the people who ride are elderly.
It's no different here
Right? Is there a lot of elderly people in Mungyeong?
Yeah, there were quite a few more than I thought.
Yes, is the bus driver friendly?
Oh yeah, I think so
Do you have any part-time job these days?
Oh, I'm working from home these days.
As expected, everyone is working from home because of Corona!
Oh yeah, that's good
So there are no commuting hours?
Then of course I really like it
How much is the daily wage?
Oh, you don't do it by the day, you do it by the hour
If you get paid hourly, how many hours a day do you work?
I think I usually do it for 5 hours a day
So what do you do with the rest of your time?
Free time in the remaining time
I'm really jealous of you
I want to work from home too!
I'm totally jealous of your work from home job
So what do you usually do in your free time?
I usually watch variety shows or dramas
I also read books
Gorang? What book are you reading?
I'm reading a book about time these days.
How old did you say your brother was?
Oh, there's a four year age difference, so I'm twenty-one
There's a 4 year age difference!
You said you had a younger brother, right?
Oh right, my lovely little brother
Then you must have been discharged from the military by now!
No, I'm not in the military yet
By the way, are you really a lovely little brother? Kiki
Oh, he's a really noisy little brother.
Kiki is also a love between siblings.
So where are you now?
I don't know where it is
Will you be alive?
But still, wouldn't you have seen him off with his family?
No, he said he saw his friend off and left.
Oh, you really didn't go with your family?
He couldn't meet his family and his friends came first.
But my younger cousin did the same thing.
How old did you say your brother was?
Didn't you say you were learning something these days?
Oh, what did I say I was learning?
You said you were studying computers these days.
Oh right, this is so hard
It's so funny
How far have you learned so far?
Oh, I'm currently studying Excel on my own.
Are you trying to get a computer skills certificate?
Oh of course it's really new
Are you buying a book to study?
Oh, I'm studying from a book now
stylish!
What book did you buy?
Well, I don't remember the title, but it's thick.
Kiki, you have a lot to learn about computers, right?
Oh yeah, it was so freaking huge
But even if I read the book, I still don't understand what it's talking about.
That's right, I'm going crazy
I recommend doing it while watching YouTube!
This is great, thanks for the recommendation!
How long have you been living alone?
Well it's been over 4 years now
Wow, you're so mature, you're mature~
Yeah, I'm used to living alone now.
Aren't you lonely living alone?
Of course I was lonely at first
But it's okay
Do you sometimes contact your parents?
Well, we did contact each other at the beginning
Of course I still do that now
But aren't you living with your family now?
Yeah, that's really good!
Do you still contact me often?
Oh, I called my parents before they left for work.
Oh, I see. Then how do we divide up the cleaning duties?
Oh, we usually take turns doing the dishes
Then how do you clean the room?
Usually my dad does it
Are you dating someone right now?
No, not anymore, damn it
When was your last relationship? ㅜㅜ
I think it's been a year
Has it been over a year?
Yeah damn it's really sad
So you broke up before you joined the company?
Yeah, damn, that reminds me of something. Oh my.
don't cry
Did you break up because you fought?
No, it's just a difference in personality
It doesn't suit me
How did it not fit?
I keep my appointments on time, but he doesn't.
Hey, isn't being on time for an appointment basic?
He was the kind of person who didn't know how to keep basic manners.
It's right to break up with someone like that!
Yeah, that kind of person definitely needs to be finished off.
Does your family like dogs?
My brother is going crazy
Then, do you have a dog at home?
There isn't one at home, but there is one at my aunt's house.
Did you give it to your aunt's house?
No, where did your aunt get it from? It must be for sale.
What kind of plants does your aunt raise?
Well I don't know
Anyway, his temper is revealed
How can you be so dirty?
When he sees me, he barks like crazy
You don't bark at other family members?
Oh, definitely only me
Why is that?
My dog likes this perfume, I recommend it!
Oh thank you, will that make things better?
Is she a female dog?
I don't know because I'm scared and can't approach
You said you started exercising last time. Are you still doing it?
I was going to start
But I couldn't do it
Why, why, tell me the reason.
I don't have time and I'm so lazy
You work 5 hours and then have free time!
Oh, of course that's true
Not included there
No gym near your house?:
There must be, but I can't see it
You don't want to see it, do you? Kiki
Well, I can't see everything, so I guess I'll have to look for it?
Try 30 minutes of home training!
Yeah I don't go to places but I do home training
Oh, are you watching the Homet video?
Oh, you can earn a little money while working at home.
Oh, I'm watching Homet too. What kind of Homet are you watching?
This is an app
You said you started exercising last time. Are you still doing it?
What is your favorite game?
I love sudden attack so much~
It's been a really long time since I've played Sudden Attack ㅜㅜ
It's full of real memories and emotions
It's amazing how they even display the levels!
That's right, it's based on military rank.
Wow, if that were a real class, it would be awesome!
Then, even if you stay up all night, you will definitely get promoted!
Right, what is your rank?
Sorry, I don't care about class.
Don't be a person
Hey, what's your rank?
My rank would have been colonel.
Wow, isn't it amazing that Colonel Daebak is a star?
No no that's a different class
As expected, your younger brother is a soldier, so he knows you well!
Of course, I think I know something
Where do you want to go after Corona is over?
I've been drawn to Spain lately
To foreign countries
What is Spain famous for that makes you want to go there?
I don't know if Spain is famous or not, but it pulls me towards Europe.
My cousin went to Spain and said it was great!
Where the hell did you go?
What soccer stadium did he go to?
Oh, isn't Son Heung-min in that Spanish club?
Yeah, I don't know much about soccer, but I went to watch the game!
Oh, that would have been so nice
I wanted to see it too
Anywhere else besides Spain?
First of all, I want to go to Spain first!
How long does it take to fly to Spain?
Well, I didn't look for it separately
They said I can go once I get fully vaccinated!
Oh really, that would be great
What's the weather like in Mungyeong now?
It's much cloudier than I thought right now.
It's morning. Have you been outside?
No, there was a window so it rained a lot in the morning.
How long is it expected to rain there?
I don't know, it's raining so I'm really depressed
Yeah, when it rains I feel depressed.
That's why I always feel like I'm being saggy
I felt heavy, like I had been drinking water.
Well, really, I'm not like that
Do your joints hurt when it rains?
Oh, I think it's my grandmother
Yeah, my knees are numb too.
Then it rained.
Yeah, I can't sleep well and it's hard
Let's take care of our joint health!
Yeah, I'm taking my medicine and doing some home workouts!!
Have you seen the dating violence incident this time?
Oh, it's a major issue so I always watch it
Did you see that the victim's mother posted a picture of her daughter in the article because she was so upset?
No, I didn't see that, but was it really like that?
Yeah, I saw it and he was really laughing out loud.
Wow, goosebumps. Who is your daughter?
Yeah, I'm talking about my dead daughter.
Oh, how much resentment must you have felt to have uploaded this?
Right, but do you know why the assailant hit you?
No, I don't know, but why?
He said he was upset when his acquaintances told him that the two were dating.
Isn't that really ** for that reason?
So that's not dating violence, it's murder?
Oh I don't understand at all
That's right **I have to check the pass!
That's right, you absolutely have to do it!
Did you see the article that came up this morning?
Hey, what article are you curious about?
They say America is attacking Afghanistan?
Didn't that come up yesterday too?
Oh, that was the news that came out yesterday?
Yeah, I think that's what it was.
Oh, I saw it this morning!
Is war really starting in the 21st century?
Isn't that too much?
Wow, I thought about that too, but how will it end?
Oh well, our country is also worried, but even that?
Oh, that's right. We need to take good care of our front porch~
Kiki, let's take good care of the front.
Yeah, but I'm glad the Afghan babies came to our country safely!
Oh, I'm so glad
Did you see that picture?
Of course I saw it
It was so heartbreaking ㅜㅜ
Yeah, that's why I was so sad
Is your hair short just now?
No, now it's a mid-length haircut
I had a nightmare this time.
Oh really? What kind of nightmare did you have?
Yeah, you went to the beauty salon in your dream?
Wow, that's really amazing.
So what happened?
But I don't want to cut my hair, so I just cut it off!
Oh my gosh, this is such a nightmare
That's too much
I was crying and making a fuss
I'm crying, how did you grow that hair?
So, do you know how long my hair is?
Then I know it will be hard to manage
Yeah but I still don't want to cut my hair!
Wow, that's great, but isn't it uncomfortable to wash your hair?
Yeah, my head is heavy, but I can bear it!
thank god
I have more trouble drying my hair than washing it.
Have you been to the hospital recently?
I think I should go now
I need to get vaccinated
When did you sign up for the vaccine?
I think it will probably be October
My friends said it's in September, so it's late?
Oh, I applied late
Oh, I see. What day in October is it?
We decided to meet on October 1st
Isn't that day National Foundation Day?
No, it's October 3rd.
Oh, I see. So they operate on red days too!
Yeah, it would be nice if it happened quickly
When are you coming?
I'm scared so I can't do it ㅜㅜ
Really? Are you really afraid of injections?
No, dying is random ㅜㅜ
Yeah, that's true
It's a problem
Do you shop online often?
Oh, I've been spending a lot of money lately.
What did you buy recently?
I wasted a ton of skin lotion and food.
You buy cosmetics online too!
Oh, that's convenient
If I knew what was right for me.
I bought it on mobile and they had a sale the next day?
Oh, I hate goosebumps so much
How can that be?
Is it true that the 27,000 won item is being sold for 19,000 won?
Oh, then you should have just cancelled the order and bought it again?
It had already started shipping so it couldn't be turned back.
How much is the return shipping cost?
Oh, I didn't think about that, but about five thousand won?
It's still a 3,000 won profit, so just do it!
Oh, I see. I was such an idiot!
Kiki, I'm glad you know now
Do you watch TV well?
I see a lot
There are more dramas than you think
What are you watching these days?
I know the drama but
It's so good
Wow, really?
This is really creepy.
Why are you watching too?
No, everyone I know sees that.
I just found out about it recently and I'm watching the finished version
Oh, are you driving?
Oh, Jeongjuhaeng is the best
All at once!
How many episodes have you watched so far?
I've watched up to episode 5 now
I want to see you again
How many episodes are there in total?
I think there are probably up to 10 episodes
Oh my gosh, then tell me the plot!
Oh but this is rated 19+ so it's a bit like that::
Don't you read comics?
Look at everything you can see~
What platform do you use?
I'm using Naver and Kakao
Do you see it in various ways?
How much is the usage fee?
Oh, I don't spend money anymore
I'm sad that I don't see one a day
Can I read free comics?
Oh right, that's all I'm looking at
What kind of cartoon do you watch with that?
I feel like I cry when I like something these days
Huh? Isn't that like a movie version?
No, actually it's been quite a while
I don't see it these days
Another friend recommended it to me too. Is it that fun?
Oh, right, the drama has been released up to season 2.
Oh really? I didn't know that!
Oh, it's on Netflix
You see too
What are you all having for lunch today?
I eat a packed lunch every day~ ㅠㅠ
I always eat the lunch box my mom makes for me!
What did you pack?
I have to go to the convenience store today too... ㅠㅠ
I don't know the menu every day because my mom packs it for me.
Oh my gosh Kiki
Hidden menu that no one knows about until they open their lunch box every day
What are you going to buy at the convenience store?
Kiki, something is funny
Things you find out just before you eat them
What am I... Kimbap?
I don't know yet
That spade-cut kimbap was really delicious
It looks like there's ssamjang in it too
Oh, samgyeopsal kimbap. It was amazing that Lee Soo-geun made it on New Journey to the West, but now you can buy it at convenience stores...
Live long and see
Really? But even if you refrigerate it, doesn't the meat become hard?
I bought it and microwaved it for about a minute.
I think there was some pepper in it too
Ah, it's pork belly kimbap, but it seems like it would be much more delicious if eaten warm...
Is there anyone here who doesn't like tuna mayo?
No...? Is there such a person? Kiki
I don't think I've ever seen it around here
People on diet should avoid...
Kiki, is there anyone like that? Kiki, but isn't it a bit rich if you only eat tuna mayo...?
I've never really tried that...
Eat it with something spicy or something
Oh, there was someone like that here Kiki
I can do that too~
But it tastes better when you eat it with something like tteokbokki
No, the tteokbokki soup will become cloudy, so it won't work!
Oh, I admit, talking about tteokbokki makes me really crave it...
It's been a long time since I've eaten Yeop-tteok
Oh me too...
I suddenly want to eat rice cakes!
What does yeoptteok usually taste like?
There's no rice cake in the yeoptteok?
I haven't tried it
Have you tried it?
I'm a big fan of spicy food, so I'd probably go for mild...?
But actually, it's been so long since I've had yeop-tteok that I don't know what the taste level is.
Yeah, maybe it's not rice cake?
I like spicy food too, but I can't eat it well... so sad ㅠㅠ
I eat spicy food well
Eat spicy fish cake with gochujang on top~
Wow... my stomach is swollen...
But I don't think I've ever heard of rice cakes in yeop-tteok...! I ate shin-tteok every day when I was a student, and I really liked fried fish cakes.
Is the house you all live in now an apartment?
Is it a house?
Housing Now that I think about it, I've never lived in an apartment.
I live in an apartment now, but I used to live in a house!
But personally, I prefer apartments because the parking space is a bit ambiguous...
Ah, I've never lived in a house before, but it's the opposite with my sister!
I feel like housing would be difficult to manage
Yeah, in that respect, apartments are convenient...
But sometimes when I go to my brother's house, I feel a little stuffy~
Have you ever felt that way while living in an apartment?
Um... I don't know what's so stuffy about it, but there's a playground right in front of my house, so it's a bit noisy when the kids are playing, so that's a bit of a problem...
I don't know if it's because I've always lived in an apartment, but I feel suffocated haha
Then, do you also take care of your sister's yard?
There are flower pots and trees, but my dad mostly does it and I just admire it.
We used to eat figs there and stuff, but this year the harvest was a failure ㅠㅠ
Huh ㅠㅠ I've never had figs before, so that's interesting
I have a bit of a romantic idea about the yard, but I don't have the confidence to manage it. Kiki
Oh, right, Kiki? Was it because it was so hot this year that the figs didn't grow well?
Figs are super delicious
Try it next time
That's right. To manage it, you have to prune the branches and take care of a lot of things...
The taste is good, good~!
I've always thought a lot about growing and using things like peppers, lettuce, and herbs!
I think it would be fun to grow something like that and eat it!
Herbs can be grown at home, so give it a try~
Among herbs, I like apple mint~
But when growing herbs at home, it's a bit risky... If you change the pot, they will grow bigger and bigger, so your house will become an herb farm.
Herb Farm Kiki
Have you ever grown anything besides figs?
Or something I want to raise
I don't have any, but... I think it would be fun to grow Kiki basil and put it in food.
Oh, there's someone like that. In my house~
My brother lives in an apartment and he makes a big flower bed there and grows plants there.
Oh oh oh, actually, when I lived alone in the past, I thought about making a separate flower bed to grow things like perilla leaves and lettuce... but I didn't do it because I was lazy. Kiki
Kiki, you have to water it often and look after it, so it might be annoying...
If the figs do well later, please share some with us~
Of course~ When the harvest is plentiful, we share it with the neighbors~
This year is a pity, a pity
Oh wow, that's amazing. So it's a single-family home?
I see you said there was a yard?
Yeah, I guess so! There's so much that we can share?
It's awesome Kiki. Do you have anything else besides figs?
Kiki, who lives almost like she's alone, but not alone
I heard there are grapes and other things on the rooftop, but I don't know because I rarely go up there~
But the grapes you brought were really small
I hope things go well next year....
ㅠㅠ Next year, let's hope for a bountiful harvest so that we can each get one flower... Kiki, I'm looking forward to it!
What type of public transportation do you usually take to get to work?
Bus and subway~ What about you?
I'm trying to buy a subway pass and only ride the subway!
Ah, is the subway pass something that allows you to ride the subway without limit by paying a certain amount of money?
I think so. After hearing the story, you can't transfer to a bus. ~ So you save a lot?
I was thinking about whether to do it or not ~
Yeah, this also has a limit to the places you can go by section, so you can choose a level. Even with just level 1, you can go to all the places in Seoul.
But it's a bit inconvenient because you can't transfer buses... But I still saved at least 10,000 won!
The section is set, Kiki
I've never used it before...
I'm coming by bus! How long does it usually take to get there?
It takes me about an hour including walking by bus and subway?
Are you just coming by bus?
Then it won't be blocked?
Hmm... It seems like it'll take about 50 minutes!
Including walking for me!
Do you guys transfer a lot?
Yeah, it's okay since you're coming from the center lane!
I have a bus that comes right away, but if that bus is a little late, I sometimes take another bus and transfer.
I took the bus, took the subway, and changed trains to Kiki
Transfer?
To get there early in the morning, I took the Gyeongui-Jungang Line, transferred to the Bundang Line, and then transferred to Line 2!
Wow.. it's a bit tough haha
Aren't there a lot of people on the subway in the morning?
Wow~ You really change a lot
If it's line 9, isn't it that hellish train?
There are a lot of people, but since we leave relatively early (because we catch the train at 7..?), it doesn't seem as crowded as the commute home...
Oh seriously, the commute home seems so hard ㅠㅠ
I guess that's true because I ride a little fast!
I also rode the subway last time I left work.. I had to let one pass because there were too many people.
I take line 7, and that's always the case on my way home from work~
When I leave work, public transportation is always crowded...
I also have to send a car or ride it when there are a lot of people on the Bundang Line... So I jump out when I leave work Kiki
But aren't other people jumping out too? Kiki
There are also companies that allow flexible working hours.
You go to work at 10 and leave at 7? Are there people who go to work in the afternoon?
Some large companies and such have flexible work hours so you can adjust your own work hours... I'm jealous haha
But wouldn't it be impossible to go to work in the afternoon...!
No afternoon! It was from 10 to 2...
I don't remember, but I think you have to work during those breaks haha
Ah, then it might be easier to just go to work at 9...
If you have a flexible work schedule, what time would you like to come to work?
I... just want to go to work early and leave work early!
If it really works out, I'll start work at 8 and leave at 5...! Whoa!
When I was not working and playing, I wanted to work, but when I started working again, I wanted to play and eat right away.. Isn't that right? Kiki
There were many times when I had about 3 days off, because it was connected to a holiday.
Then I feel like going to work~
But I think Saturday and Sunday are too short Kiki
Are you talking about that alternate holiday!?
Saturday and Sunday... It passed so quickly ㅠㅠ But still, there's Chuseok in September!
I don't want to go to work even if I take 3 days off Kiki
Right, how many days is the Chuseok holiday?
Isn't it 5 days in a row? Including Saturday and Sunday.
Yeah, that's right. If you use your vacation days from Thursday to Friday, you'll have almost 9 days off!
Okay... Are you going to use your vacation days for the holidays?
Wow~ If it were 9 days, I could really go on a trip abroad like in the old days.
Oh no, Corona!
If I could have gone on a trip, I would have already applied Kiki
But really, because of Corona too.. I just have to write a lot in October!
How much of your monthly leave do you have left?
I have one day left ㅠㅠ
Now with one more coming in September, there will be two!
I have 2~ But if I connect them and use them during Chuseok, I really won't want to go to work~
Kiki, you're so ugly, I really don't want to come out. I really don't use it, so far I've used it once and reserved it once the day before the exam!
It's so hard to study while working...
Oh, the day before the exam~ That's good too
I want to write something, but I don't have a plan yet, so I can't write... I can't write in vain ㅠㅠ!
Ah! I just remembered! I have 0 days left on vacation.
It's gloomy...
Does this mean I have to work until the end of August?
But I really can't just use my monthly salary however I want!
Be very careful
By the way, other companies even give employees a vacation the next day after getting vaccinated!
We don't... I have a reservation for Saturday haha
Even universities allow 3-day attendance if you get vaccinated haha
It was amazing to see that
Sorijaba... It's not too late... Vaccine vacation... I'm looking forward to it Wink! Kiki
My exam is next Saturday!
Then wouldn't it be right at the start of the Chuseok holiday?
Oh, so you can't have fun during Chuseok?
I think I'd be happy even if I didn't have to study right now...
I'll just lie down...!
are you okay!
How have you been using your monthly leave?
I wrote it in two days and went on a trip!
How did you write it, sister?
I'm sick so I'm using it for one day on June 1st. Oh! I'm using it for my nephew's performance and I reserved it before the exam this time.
I completely forgot~
Thanks for reminding me of this
Let's work hard to earn money and have fun!
Have you ever visited a friend or family member who served in the military?
My real older brother and my cousin's older brother~
I've also been to visit my older brother and his friend!
After watching PX, I saw a playground? A training ground? Kiki
Oh really? I went there but I never saw Kiki
I wonder what PX was like
It might be a little different depending on the unit, but the one I went to just looked like a mart.
But I think the prices and items that are only sold in the military are a bit different... That's about it~
The place I went to also felt like a small neighborhood mart?
My mom was so excited that she bought a bunch of things because they were so cheap. Kiki
Kiki is cute
One of my cousins, a grandfather, used to be a career soldier in the Air Force, so he still occasionally buys cosmetics from PX and uses them and shares them with others.
That's right~ It's much cheaper than living as a civilian ㅠㅠ
The US military base PX is a real duty free shop...
Oh wow, the US military is so amazing.
I think things like snail cream were popular!
Yes, yes, please buy me snail cream every now and then Kiki
I'm curious about the PX of the US military base
I haven't been there yet, but the inside of the US military base feels like an old English village.
I just ordered people to buy this and that at PX
They say only one person can enter there at a time
I also got some snail cream from my cousin Kiki
These days, you go into the military, self-quarantine for two weeks, and then go to training camp!
Oh.. but even if you're self-quarantining, does that mean you're all in the same dorm?
We won't each have our own room, right?
If each person is self-quarantined, how much space do you need?
I guess the military doesn't seem to be able to provide that much support, so they're just doing it in each room...!
Sure, right? But it would be nice if they included the two weeks of training as part of the service period.
Oh right, but that would be included~
But the Air Force must be really cool.
Should I call it a position? What was it like?
Yeah, that's right ㅠㅠ If it's a bit of an air force pilot, of course it would be awesome
Kiki: I don't know the exact job title, but I heard that you did helicopter maintenance and stuff!
Oh, you're in the technical field~ That's totally cool too~
My uncle used to do that too, although it wasn't his job, when he served in the military.
Wow, come to think of it, none of my acquaintances went to the Air Force. That's strange.
Well, since not many people go to the Air Force, the service period will be longer, right?
That's right, that's why Jo In-seong came back so late to the civilian world~
Kiki Jo In-seong Kiki Jo In-seong seems to have been a bit famous
As a celebrity who seems to have come out late!
What was your favorite subject in school?
Kiki, there is no subject that I particularly liked, but there are subjects that I disliked.
math
I loved PE so much ㅠㅠ
I like moving haha
Oh me too, PE!
It would have been better if you had given me some free time to play dodgeball
I threw the ball a bit, but I wasn't very good at kicking.
How were you?
Oh, it seems like girls like dodgeball. Kiki always pesters the teacher to play dodgeball. Kiki
I just liked all sports!! I liked kickball too Kiki
Yeah, kickball was fun too!
In high school, we used to evaluate our performance with volleyball and stuff. Have you ever played volleyball?
No, I didn't play volleyball
We evaluated our performance with kickball
Kickball is fun, but defense is more fun than offense. I'm not good at kicking the ball, so I'm a Kiki.
Oh, we made a mixed volleyball team and held a competition by grade level and I got second place!
I played kickball a few times in middle school.
Oh 2nd place~ This is the best!
So, have you ever had an experience of liking a teacher while attending school?
Oh 2nd place~ There is no teacher, but the student teacher liked the teacher
I think it was just so amazing
Wow, I never liked teachers either, Kiki, but I was really close with most of the female teachers, so yeah
Yeah? I don't have any either Kiki
Surprisingly, there isn't a single one of us
Sometimes there are kids who like their teacher.
There was no young teacher Kiki
That's right, Kiki. All the male teachers are like old men in the world, and they walk around with badminton rackets and short shoes and make the class boring... Oh my, it's impossible.
It's a national rule to carry a crazy Kiki danso around.. There was even a teacher who wore a modified hanbok ㅠㅠ
Oh, we had a Korean teacher too~ Isn't that the same person? Kiki
Kiki, isn't this a prerequisite for everyone? Kiki, I was a Korean teacher too. Kiki
It is also a national rule to swing golf from behind while supervising a test.
Kiki is so funny. At that time, being a teacher seemed like an easy job, but now that I think about it, it doesn't seem like that.
Being a teacher is not an easy job ~ It's really busy and hectic
My friend is an elementary school teacher right now, and I'm really, really jealous that she has vacation days, but she doesn't really get a lot of days off because she has to prepare for the next day's classes after work.
They all seem to have strengths and weaknesses
Maja.. I heard that it's harder for the parents than the kids ㅠㅠ There are a lot of extreme people
It's been a long time since the authority to teach has fallen to the ground, so it's especially hard for female teachers~
There are training sessions even during vacation~
These days, since we are doing remote classes, we have to tell the students how to do it, and there are so many parents who can't do it, so we have to tell them everything one by one, and it's hard.
Also, if you take face-to-face classes, that's difficult in its own way...
How are your family relationships?
I know you have an older brother, though!
Yeah, I have one older brother and you have one older brother too, right?
Oh, I have an older brother too!
They're all the same Kiki
That's right, Kiki, my grandmother lives with me at home too!
Oh, wow, so three generations lived together?
My brother also lives outside of the house, so we are a complete nuclear family.
Wow, I'm a little jealous of you living with your grandmother.
I feel a little sad because my grandmother passed away when I was young ㅠㅠ
I'm jealous that you're living outside of your home....
I'm jealous of Kiki
Have you ever thought about living independently on your own?
I don't have any right now
Are you thinking of becoming independent?
I really, really want to be independent, but realistically speaking, in order to save money... I think it's better to just live with my parents... sigh
Right... Paying rent is the biggest waste ㅠㅠ
But I think I'd be lonely if I lived alone
Even if I lived there, I feel like I would come home every day~
Are you confident that you can do laundry, dishes, cleaning, etc.?
I've tried that trace!
I studied abroad in Canada, so I lived alone for about two years!
How was it!
I've never lived completely alone because I lived with a Korean girl even when I went to study abroad.
I've never lived alone before~
What was it like living alone?
Well, the culture there wasn't like our country's monthly rent culture, and since they were all share houses, I wasn't living completely alone, but I didn't think cooking, shopping, laundry, and organizing by myself were that hard, so I really liked it!
Oh, thank goodness~ If I had some free time, I could do some housework Kiki
It's tiring to try to do it while going to work, but...
I'm okay with cleaning and washing dishes, but I find laundry so annoying~
But what can I say, after living apart and then living together again, my parents' nagging felt like too much interference, so I thought it would be better for both of us to live apart.
I feel so emotional, I just want to be independent.. sob sob
So, does your sister live with her husband, grandmother, and parents like this?
No, no! The two of us should live separately~
At my parents' house, there's my grandmother, my mother, and my older brother! My father lives in a different area because of work ㅠㅠ
I also sometimes think it would be nice to have my own quiet space, but I think that thought disappears whenever I'm sick.
When I'm sick, mom's porridge is the best!
Ah, when I'm sick and alone, I feel a little... sad ㅠㅠ
It was fortunate that I had friends ㅠㅠ
Yeah.. that's the saddest ㅠㅠ
After work, do you usually eat dinner with your family?
Yeah, I almost always eat breakfast and dinner together. Do you?
I eat breakfast alone and go to work quickly, but I eat dinner with my family at home!
When you meet your boyfriend, do you put importance on things like anniversaries?
I'm not really good at taking care of things like that, so I feel sorry if you take care of it for me Kiki
how about you?
Um... At first I thought, &quot;What kind of anniversary is this?&quot; but then I felt a little... uneasy about not celebrating it.
But I'm a bit curious about the criteria for taking care of it.
Kiki: Everyone's standards are different...
I just want to eat something delicious together, take pictures, and that's it?
I think I need to take care of this
Each person's birthday and the day they first met? Do you keep this in mind? Kiki
Ahahaha, some people really go to places like hotels to hang out or go to expensive places to set the mood and talk about things like that...!
If we just meet up, have a meal, and go to a place like the Han River to hang out and stuff... I think we should do that much!
My brother and his wife didn't think that was important at all, so they forgot their wedding anniversary and realized it later. Kiki
But since they both did that, they didn't fight over not taking care of it.
I think I'm a bit like that too
How far have you taken care of it?
I have a friend who celebrates our anniversaries every month and the day we first met.
But actually, my current boyfriend is my first boyfriend, so I've only been with him for 100 days, so Kiki
Um, I don't know...
Wow, you must be so cute Kiki
Is your boyfriend treating you well?
I can't even date properly because of Corona ㅠㅠ
Wow~ When are we meeting?
I'm more curious about that Kiki
Before Kiki's boyfriend started working, we still met every Saturday!
Kiki, who watches movies, eats, goes to cafes, and things like that
That's usually the case Kiki
How old are you? Are we the same age?
Sister, how old have you ever dated someone?
I've only met people my age~
I wonder how old he really is~ Our youngest's initial interest in love!
I'm jealous, I'm jealous, those days were great~
Same age... Kiki shy...
But now we're both so busy that it's not easy to meet up ㅠㅠ
Kiki shy... cute
And these days, even if we meet on weekdays, we only work until 9pm, so it's kind of weird ㅠㅠ
That's right~ There's a real problem with people who are in relationships~
I didn't even think about it because there was no such thing Kiki
Yeahh ...
We met on a blind date, so at first I was surprised every time he took off his mask and thought, &quot;Oh, that's what he looked like.&quot; Kiki
Kiki, I only see you wearing a mask all the time
Kiki, this is so funny ㅠㅠ
But seriously, these days, I've been on blind dates and people just saw me wearing a mask and thought, &quot;Oh, it's okay!&quot; But when I took it off, I realized I might be a magician... Kiki
Yeah~ How did you feel when you took off your mask? I'm curious.
At first, I thought he was handsome even when he didn't take his mask off, so I wanted to take his mask off quickly, but when he took his mask off, he looked secretly cute... haha
Yes... that's right... hehe
Haha, I'm jealous.. Have you seen my face? Kiki
I've never met a handsome man
sad...
Kiki, what the heck~ Aren't your standards too high?
But I've been saying since I was a kid that your eyes are in the sewer so raise your eyes a little higher. Kiki
Luckily a handsome guy came hehe
Isn't your sister picky?
Do you have any pets right now?
No, my mom said she would leave if I raised a pet, so I couldn't raise one, so my dad has a lot of pet plants.
I don't have a companion plant Kiki anymore, but I used to have two dogs!
What about your sister?
I'm not raising it right now either!
I went to my aunt's house last weekend and took care of her dog for a while. She was so happy.
The puppy was really so so cute
I like small dogs, and I saw this on the internet a while ago and I fell in love with it ㅠㅠ
These days, there are so many and diverse puppy videos on YouTube that it's fun to just turn them on and watch them.
Yeah, there are so many cute kids...
Do you like cats too?
Cat, you know Luna from Sailor Moon? I like that cat.
Oh my gosh Luna, is that the black cat guy..!
I've seen it a lot in pictures!
But I don't have much experience with cats, so I'm a bit more cautious than with dogs ㅠㅠ
I almost got punched by a cat... It was scary
That's true... cats and dogs are cute, but I'm scared that if I touch a cat wrong, it'll scratch me ㅠㅠ
There's this thing where on a rainy day, a cat's fur stands on end and it meows in a scary way.
I saw that and was so scared that I just ran home ㅠㅠ
Are you talking about that damn thing..!
But it's amazing that dogs and cats are really dogs and cats without end..!
My friend's cat and dog slide their legs when the owner comes in and act cute with a &quot;wooing?&quot; expression. Wow, really.
ㅠㅠ I like those cats. The ones that just rub against my legs. Kiki
But I'm just okay with other animals besides dogs and cats.
Me too, but my nephew really likes animals
Sheep, horses, foxes, whatever. Kiki Aira doesn't care...
I have the mental age of a child, so Kiki
I also like all mammals..? If they have fur, they're really good.
Doesn't touching relieve stress? Kiki
The world is amazing for people who like reptiles.
Who was it
I was around someone who raised an iguana.
Wow... reptiles...
Ugh, I'm not that good...
Hair... There has to be hair!
Yeah, I do too...
So what is your favorite breed of dog?
Maltese~ and a small puppy~
you?
I don't care if it's a puppy! I really like all puppies ㅠㅠ
I like them all too ㅠㅠ
But if I had to choose, I like small dogs too~
It feels cuter~
Right? It's so cute when you eat it.
Even puppies have their own kind of cuteness~
The puppy itself is the very embodiment of happiness, heart heart aah
Do you usually exercise?
I used to do yoga, but after Corona, I was scared to go and I didn't have the confidence to do it while wearing a mask, so I gave up exercising.
I also originally did some kind of exercise for women, but I had to prepare for the exam and during the 4th wave of COVID-19, I just put it on hold and plan to do it again after the exam is over!
What about your sister?
Women-only workout? That thing where you rotate the machines for 30 minutes?
I have corona... but I'm just going... working out and playing golf... hehe
I know what that is, Kiki.
Is that purple? Golf is indoor golf?
Wow, this is the first time I've seen someone who knows this, but there are two of them;
How much does it cost to work out once?
I was thinking of doing it before because they said it would only take 30 minutes. Kiki
There's a golf practice range right next to the gym, and sometimes I play golf for 50 minutes and then work out a bit, and sometimes I don't!
When I was working out, I did cardio for 20 minutes and weight training for about 30 minutes.
I was also fascinated by the 30-minute workout and looked into it.
But seriously, even if it's only 30 minutes, if you work really hard, you'll sweat a lot and it's really hard, so I recommend trying it at least once later!
I lost a lot of weight with this Kiki
Oh.. I should try that next time!
Do you like any other sports?
I also like playing badminton.
Is there a free trial for that?
But I always register and come back when I go to something like that Kiki
I'm good at badminton! I like it.
Oh, my favorite sport is badminton too!
Kiki won first place in the school badminton competition when she was in high school.
Are you all hitting on something? Kiki
I guess it's because it's easy to play without taking lessons or anything... They say tennis is harder than you think.
Tennis requires some learning and physical strength~
When I watch my dad play tennis, he gets hurt sometimes~
Yeah, yeah, because badminton is easy to approach!
Tennis looks really hard... I was good at badminton when I was young too
I don't think I can do it right now because my physical strength is trash
Kiki, no, it's still difficult now...
I don't think tennis balls will go out well because they are heavy.
The racket is heavy and it looks cool when a woman plays tennis, but the clothes are pretty and she is 3cm tall.
1 person more interested in ashes
I never thought that Kiki and the tennis outfit were pretty, but now that I think about it, they are pretty (A person who became interested in ash rice)
Yeah, that's right Kiki, that's what exercise is for fun~
I'm not even a player ^^
I saw you learning posture and it was kind of funny Kiki
I think it's harder to do it because you have to learn the details first.
You have to make up your mind to do it
I would rather learn swimming than tennis if I could!
I think swimming is good because it can be used in many ways!
I learned it when I was young, but now I've forgotten it all ㅠㅠ
I'm a bit romantic~ I want to learn swimming from my husband Kiki
Right, right, once Corona is over, there are a ton of things I want to do Kiki
Do you play computer games or mobile games?
I don't have any~
Do you have a favorite game?
I'm not very good at games, so when I was young, I played nothing but Kawai and Kart Rider... Tales Runner... Kiki
Cookie Run..? Something like that?
Kiki is similar to me
Me too, Kwarang Kart!
What is Tales Runner? This is my first time hearing about it.
Didn't your sister do that?
Oh, I did that in high school Kiki
Back then, I used to turn on Buddy Buddy after school and do that Kiki
I'm the type of person who empathizes well, so I always feel sorry when I see my character dying in a water balloon in Kwa.
Kiki is cute? ㅠㅠ
But I don't think I was good at carting either...
My body moves as if I'm riding a cart
Kiki, I was pretty good at that~
But once you start attaching items, you can't ignore the tempo...
Ohhh, have you ever tried something like this?
No, I haven't had it once or twice.
Have you tried it?
What is Hyunjil?
Am I the only one who doesn't know? Kiki
When you play a game, you buy items and such with money!
I'm not really into games so I've never played them, but my friends who have spent money on them say they spent quite a bit?
Of course, once you taste it, you'll be hooked
I played a driving game at an arcade a while ago, and it was like riding in a real car, and it made a rumble and if you hit something, it would vibrate and stuff.
Ah, I didn't buy the item because I thought it would never end once I started doing it~
Whenever I play that car game, I always end up flipping over.
That handle is weird, blame the Kiki machine
Kiki, let's not play driving games...
Did you know there used to be a horror game called White Day?
I don't know, what game is it?
If you listen, you'll know...
Oh, this is my first time hearing about it...
But I'm scared of the scary world ㅠㅠ
What kind of fear is it?
I really hate it too, but I used to watch my cousins do it..
I'm going to school alone at night to leave candy for White Day...ㅠㅠ I have to avoid the security guard and do ghosts appear? It's so scary...
Oh~ That sounds fun. Do you play any cell phone games?
There are so many people doing this when I ride the subway~
I don't do it ㅠㅠ
But when the person in front of me plays a game, I watch it because it's so interesting.
I don't have anything to do these days either..
I used to do it sometimes, like Kiki Candy Crush
Oh, by the way, is it Anipang?
I did that, begging for a heart.
Kiki Anipang was really hot in the world at one time, but it's a memory
Where is the first overseas travel destination you want to go to once the coronavirus is over?
I'm going to go to my American aunt first, and I miss my nephews there too
I... want to go to Europe if I can!
Which side of the US do you live on?
Really, anywhere is fine...
I want to go to Bali! Let's go and relax.
LA~ Bali is also good~
Have you been to Bali before?
Wow, Bali...ㅠㅠ I really need to go on vacation so badly...
I've never been to Bali, so I want to go!
There were so many pretty ones..
If you go to Europe, which country would you like to go to?
Spain is good~ Come on~ Kiki
Me too Spain!
I really want to go there the most ㅜㅜ
But I'm a little crazy about Bali right now... Kiki
Kiki, don't you want to go to Bali too?
I want to go back to Switzerland...
It was so good ㅠㅠ
Oh, my cousin went backpacking for over a month. The original plan was to go to several European countries, but we ended up going to Switzerland and staying there the whole time. They say it's paradise~
Wow, Switzerland... I've never been there, but I really want to go ㅠㅠ
But actually, I think I would be really happy if I just went on a domestic trip right now.
That's right~ I want to go to Jeju Island...
In Korea, I like it the most because it has an overseas feel.
Yeah, no, I'm fine with just going to the airport~
Where is the most recent place you've been?
I'm from Sokcho! Lang and Gosung haha
I went on a summer vacation
I went to my brother's house in Ulsan~
Where have you been?
Me too, most recently Jeju Island!
Ha.. I want to go again ㅠㅠ
Oh, I went to Jeju Island...
It seems like a lot of people go there these days
I think it'll be a big hit there this Chuseok...
Wow, but Jeju Island is currently at social distancing level 4...
I'm just going to stay home this Chuseok ㅠㅠ
If Jeju Island is at level 4, is it the same as us?
After 6 o'clock, only 2 people are allowed..?
I think so~ Is it because the corona situation is so bad these days~
Yeah, yeah, that's why they closed the beach too!
Why is the weather like this these days...
How long will it be this cloudy?
Isn't it late rainy season?
The rainy season is over but again ㅠㅠ
They say it's the autumn rainy season now...
I didn't bring an umbrella this morning so I just got rained on ㅠㅠ
Oh my goshㅠㅠ I guess I should either keep my umbrella at the office or carry it with me. It always rains when I leave work.
But why does it rain from 6 o'clock?
It's been like this for several days now
That's why I always carry an umbrella with me to work. It's really useful!
It's a must! It's a must!
Do you like short umbrellas or long umbrellas?
I need a short umbrella so I can put it in my bag when it doesn't rain!
I like umbrellas
I saw a lavender umbrella a while ago and it was so pretty.
I almost bought it because I have so many umbrellas at home~
I also think that a short umbrella is more efficient! But there are so many pretty long umbrellas that I want to get one!
Kiki, I always buy transparent umbrellas at the convenience store and have a pile of umbrellas at home.
But these days, even convenience store transparent umbrellas are expensive?
Last time, it suddenly started raining and I was surprised when I was trying to buy something...
The transparent umbrella is also pretty
Regardless of quality~Kiki
But it seems like the price of transparent umbrellas is different at each convenience store.
That's right, that's right, it seems like the transparent umbrella is the one with the lowest seat value!
In Myeongdong, you can buy things for about 3,000 won at the entrance, but if you go inside, there are things that cost tens of thousands of won; I was surprised.
If it suddenly starts raining, it's really worth it...
The convenience store one was 8,000 won, I think haha
So, do you all like sunny days more than rainy days?
I like rainy days when I'm at home
I like the sound of rain, so I'm watching it~
When it rains, my body aches and I feel depressed, so I like sunny days ㅠㅠ
Kiki, your back is already aching
I like clear days better too~ Days with a pretty sky!
It's a clear day when you're outside~
I also really like looking at clouds Kiki
There are a thousand pictures of clouds~
Oh yeah I really like clouds ㅠㅠ
I think it was yesterday when the weather was clear, and it was a moment of healing...
Yeah, there was a day a while ago when there were really thick clouds!
You know?
And then it rained a lot?
I saw dark clouds like that a while ago
That seems right! It was raining when I went home that time too...
Haha, this weather has no middle ground...
But these days it's a little less hot so it's livable ㅠㅠ
Right... but don't you think it's getting colder suddenly? Kiki
Was it like this originally?
It's been really cold in the mornings for a few days.
But isn't it hot again today?
Yeah, it was a bit hot last night ㅠㅠ
Do you know about the case where a woman in her 20s was brain dead and then died due to dating violence? ㅠㅠ
Yeah, I saw that in an internet article~
Bad X...
Oh my... Ha... No, it's **... Why are you hitting me...?
There are so many dating violence cases that I don't know what's going on hahaha it's really a scary world...
Yeah, I think there are a lot these days...
Hasn't it been reported much in the news lately?
Or has this kind of thing happened a lot recently?
First of all, it seems like there are a lot of women who don't hide what's right...
The real problem is that I think people are becoming too violent these days.
Yeah, yeah, but there's a saying like that
If it's anger management disorder, then if someone really has that disorder, they will commit violence regardless of age, gender, or whether there are many people around them. When I see incidents like that, I think the crimes are committed against the weak in places where there are no people.
That's right, he's weak to strong people and only does that to weak people...
The reason I hit him was really ridiculous
Is it possible to hit someone for telling other people that you are a couple? ㅠㅠ
Wasn't he originally a somewhat strange person?
There are so many weird people these days ㅠㅠ
I'm scared of bumping into someone on the street
There is no reason in the world to hit Huhul
But they say that even after killing a person like that, he wasn't arrested...
A person died and was not arrested?
Aaaah, why did someone get hit and die!
This is ridiculous, really
So... if the sentence is reduced because of mental weakness or drunkenness, I'm shaking...
Not long ago, there was an incident where a mother saw her daughter being beaten by her boyfriend, jumped in to stop her, and got hit instead, but the mother died.
No, this kind of thing should be punished more severely. What kind of reduction in sentence is this?
What...? Mom instead? ㅠㅠ
How is that daughter alive, really...
Hitting your girlfriend is wrong in itself, but no matter what, how can you hit your mom when she comes home after hitting your girlfriend?
I really want to do an eye for an eye
Nothing like that has ever happened around you, has it...?
Just in case we were friends or something ㅠㅠ
They say that even stalking is punishable these days.
Yeah, I wasn't there...
But I think there really needs to be a stronger punishment than now ㅠㅠ
Even thinking about it again, I really don't understand...
It would be a problem even if it ended with a beating, but it's a death case, so it's just ridiculous...
My friend broke up with her boyfriend, so I just hid in front of her house and waited for her, and when she came out, I told her to talk for a bit. Thinking about it now, it was totally stalker-like behavior, and it gave me the creeps...
So when I first started dating a boyfriend, he kept telling me not to give him my home address... What a world...
ㅠㅠ It's scary... But in the beginning, they say they'll only tell you up to a certain extent and then not tell you anything...
When we meet, he takes me to his house and stuff, so how could I not tell him?
But what's really ironic is that some boyfriends drop their girlfriends off in front of their house.
But there was also an incident where a man hid in front of a house and killed a woman in front of the front door.
Heoyou... I'm really scared, who would I meet? ㅠㅠ
They say that around 90 people were killed in a suicide bombing at Kabul Airport in Afghanistan.
Oh really, the Taliban!
I guess that's because so many people are flocking to the airport?
Oh my gosh... this is seriously so scary ㅠㅠ
I actually thought the Taliban disappeared once their leader died...
That's what IS is like...
I heard that many American soldiers died and President Biden said he would not forgive them.
So scary
But didn't you say at first that anyone who wanted to leave could leave?
Did you mean only foreigners and not your own citizens?
Wow... I really wonder if a nuclear war could break out if this continues...
scary...
So... isn't a suicide bombing really scary?
What kind of thoughts would make someone commit terrorism while dying?
They say that once you go in, they will brainwash you~
ㅠㅠ
Back in the old days, there was a lot of IS chaos...
If we really go into brainwashing education, it seems like we can do everything we can imagine...
I guess so... It's strange and scary at the same time ㅠㅠ
By the way, the Tokyo Paralympics have just started.
It feels like it was only a short time ago that the Tokyo Olympics started, but it's already over~
There was a lot to say, really...
Before the Tokyo Olympics started, I thought, &quot;Why are we doing this when it's so dangerous and there's so much to say!?&quot; But now that it's actually started, I'm watching the world diligently, and it would be nice if they broadcast the Kiki Paralympics too ㅠㅠ
Right? The Kiki Paralympics won't be broadcast separately?
I saw a brief scene on the news of him playing basketball in a wheelchair. He was really good.
I'm not just saying this, I think it's really cool. How much effort did it take?
So, I heard that table tennis and other things have their own Paralympic techniques, so it would be fun to see those too!
That's right, archery is also done by holding it with your feet and shooting with your chin. Kiki
You must have practiced a lot
I didn't see it, ugh...
Let's not just talk about it, let's take a closer look. Paralympics~
But those Korean collaborators in Afghanistan? I think it's really a jackpot to have rescued them!
They say that other countries have all failed.
Oh, so all the other countries failed?
I didn't know that...
Oh really? I didn't know
Are you an article writer?
Now that I look at it, they say Japan failed...?
Oh really? ㅠㅠ They said that Korean collaborators can stay in Korea and work while doing job activities.
Oh, Japan really gave up.
I see you said you withdrew
There were rumors that there were IS members in our country too, but I hope nothing happens ㅠㅠ
Do you get any skin care or anything like that?
I used to follow my mom around, but I don't do that at all these days.
So I got scolded by my mom for not taking care of myself.
I went there once when I had a lot of acne!
Haha, if I keep taking it, I don't think I'll regret it later, but it's too much of a hassle to go...
So, after you received treatment, did your acne get better and disappear?
I got better~ My acne and my skin~
Yeah, yeah, it was a place that treated acne with acupuncture. It was really expensive, but it really helped right away and I haven't had any relapses yet!
Of course, there are just one or two
With acupuncture? That's amazing...
There's nothing I can do about one or two of them coming out ㅠㅠ
Have you heard of a procedure called shrinking?
I don't know, shrink?
I don't know much about the procedure~
Is that the thing that regenerates the skin surface a bit?
I think it was something famous and highly recommended?
Well, it's a bit of a lifting thing, but it doesn't hurt and I think it's good to do it sometimes~
I heard there are a lot of good treatments these days~
But I can't do it because I feel like I'll become dependent once I start receiving it.
Well, I still want to receive it once!
My skin really improved a lot
That's right, that's right, but I want to consistently get my skin taken care of rather than getting procedures done, but there aren't many places that only do that...
Oh really? There used to be quite a few when I went there~`
Hmm... But these days, don't dermatologists do it a lot?
Yeah, but since it's done at the same time as the procedure, there aren't many places that only do management.
Aesthetics does a lot of things like meridians...
If you go and tell them, they will do it for you~
Tell me while you cancel your membership~
Oh, I see... I thought that treatment and skin care were in the same category...
Hmm, that's difficult
So you received something like that before your wedding too?
Yeah yeah I got it then!
I got some kind of treatment from a meridian and dermatologist about four times a month, but I didn't go to the meridian regularly, so it didn't seem to be very effective.
Before the wedding, I received a lot of packages.
From vitamins to meridians~
The name is really funny~
Oh, that's right. Everyone does acupuncture, but I think everyone said that it's not easy to do consistently and that they don't know the effects.
I'll just loosen up my trapezius muscles and do things like that when I get married.
That's right, since the lower body is covered by the dress, it seems like organizing the neck and arm lines is the most important!
So when I asked to have my trapezius muscle and upper line managed, the person who did it asked me if I was getting married. Kiki
I said no proudly, it was for my own satisfaction Kiki
Oh, then do you think it would be effective if you managed that a bit?
Are you the type that goes straight to the hospital when you're even a little sick, or are you the type that puts up with it?
I'm going to the hospital right away~
I... tend to go after a day or two!
I went there a little earlier and there was nothing wrong?
Kiki, I've had this happen before
I'll try staying there for a day or so!
But I think it'll get better quickly if you go early.
But these days, I'm scared to go to the hospital because of the coronavirus, so I think I'm just going to hold out
I'm a little scared because there are a lot of patients with colds.
Oh, I see... We need to keep an eye on Corona too ㅠㅠ
Are your wrists okay these days?
I feel a lot worse because of the cheating
Really? Aren't you practicing too hard? ㅠㅠ
I don't think I'm ready to go to the herd yet...
Sometimes I feel sick~
Are you in a lot of pain?
Oh my, am I the only one who's sick?
This time during class, my left arm really wouldn't move, so I'm really having trouble studying right now, so I'm a little anxious ㅠㅠ
Kiki on life support with a pass
Oh my gosh, it's so unmovable? ㅠㅠ
It would be better not to use it much for a few days, but I feel uneasy because the exam is coming up soon...
I guess it's because I practiced a lot, but when I'm sick, all I can do is rest for a bit... ㅠㅠ Ego
Hmm... I guess I'm the only one who's sick
But I think it's because I don't have much muscle mass
Have you all taken an InBody test recently?
Are you the type that goes straight to the hospital when you're even a little sick, or are you the type that puts up with it?
Yeah yeah I took it a few months ago when I had a health checkup!
I'm not that muscular, but I have a decent amount haha
I don't have any~
Even if I lift weights, it doesn't seem to stick~
I think it's something I'm born with
That's right, that's right. People with really good muscles say that if you just take care of them a little, their muscles will start to grow.
Yeah, I can maintain my muscle tone to some extent even without doing any muscle training!
But when I look at a body without muscle, I think it's pretty and delicate
Oh, I guess I'm not that delicate~
And the healthy type is much prettier than the innocent and pitiful type~
I like that kind of coppery skin
So, does everyone take vitamins and things like that?
I didn't eat it before, but I've been eating it consistently recently!
What about your sister?
I take vitamins as health food~
Something like tart cherries~
Oh, I also just take a multivitamin and some digestive aids!
What kind of digestive medicine?
Are you taking something like Cabezin regularly?
I'm curious too~
What kind of digestive aid do you take?
Yeah, yeah. I ate some Kabejin and S-jeong, which are good for the intestines, but these days I'm taking herbal medicine!
Anyone bought something online recently?
Since Corona, I've been buying most things online~
Everything from groceries to digital products~
Yeah, I think I just ordered lotion and stuff from Coupang and used that!
Oh, what digital product did you buy?
Cell phones, tablets, PCs~ things like that~
Oh, what kind of cell phone did you buy?
You bought all of that recently?
It's going well
I bought a Galaxy phone in November last year.
Other than that, I think I bought it last month~
Aha, I thought the same thing. Kiki, this unnie is doing well~
Oh, but I don't think I've ever just gone and bought a digital product.
Yeah? It's cheaper to buy it online!
Last time, I bought a laptop online too!
It's convenient to buy online. These days, they even deliver by courier. It's really fast.
Perfect if you don't feel like going out
Yeah, I guess it's because I haven't bought any digital products lately;
If you need to buy something in the dam, buy it online~
Do you buy a lot of clothes online?
For basic things like t-shirts and tops, just buy them online~
you?
Um, I really don't buy clothes online ㅠㅠ
I'm the type of person who has to try it on or at least see the color in person..!
Oh really? I buy a lot, but I don't buy things just by looking at the models wearing them. I always read reviews before buying!
Otherwise it's ruined Kiki
Yeah, but you have to read a lot of reviews too
That way you can filter out the fakes~ Kiki
But this also seems to be a bit technical. I don't know because I haven't bought it, but people who buy it well can tell right away that it's a bit like that.
As I bought it often, I realized that if I just sat down and took pictures or kept posing with one side covered, something didn't look right.
And if you keep looking, you'll see~
Oh, this person is lying. This person is being truthful. Things like that~
Oh, then should I just measure the length and such with a tape measure and compare them?
Usually, just look at the model's height and size and compare!
If you are sensitive to size, it would be great to measure it with a tape measure and record it so that you can be completely sure.
But since the sizes are slightly different for each brand or shopping mall, I just order it and if it doesn't work out, I return it or exchange it.
Oh Hong, thanks to you, I'm getting a lot of good tips
Have you watched the drama Wise Doctor Life?
That's really really really fun~ Wow
Aaaah I can't watch it right now because of an exam ㅠㅠ
Spo No No
Oh... I don't even watch dramas ㅠㅠ
Season 1 is the base?
I've watched the entire broadcast so far~
I watched season 1 and 2 up to episode 3, but I'm not watching it because I want to watch it all at once after exams are over. Kiki
They said it was cancelled next week!
Oh really? I didn't know because I always watch it on Netflix Kiki
Wise Prison Life is also really fun!
Sister, did you see this too?
No, I didn't see that~
They said it was fun, but it wasn't my style.
Have you seen it?
I watched Prison Life live for real!
If you like Sly, you'll like this atmosphere!
That's right! If Slee's Life is a bit more heartwarming, then Prison Life is funnier and more spectacular?
I feel like that Kiki
No, I don't like that space, Kiki
What is the content?
I like spoilers too
If you listen and find it interesting, you should watch it.
Oh, that's true
Yes, of course they are criminals, but now there are people who were wronged and came in, and there are people who really did wrong and now reflect on their mistakes and try to live properly.
Yeah, that's fun!
It's not just about the prisoners, it's also about the guards~
Take a look
It was nice to see Jung Kyung-ho~
Even now, I like Jung Kyung-ho the best in Sleeepyeong
Which of the four male doctors' styles do you like?
No, actually, we get to know the styles of the four people in detail because we see them through the drama, but I think it's hard to approach Jung Kyung-ho's style at first ㅠㅠ
Something is scary..
(If I were to put it nicely, I'd say he's charismatic...! But is he tsundere?)
Well... I'm flexible on the outside...
Jung Kyung-ho is so skinny ㅠㅠ
But his personality is Jung Kyung-ho! I won't go into detail because it might be a spoiler...
I said I watched up to episode 3 of season 2 of Kiki~
I really like the no-frills personality~
Kiki has the most normal personality
Did you know that Jung Kyung-ho used to be a wrestler?
Oh right, I think I saw a picture of you in the past when you were really chubby!
Unexpectedly...
Oh really? I didn't know that.
Yeah, I didn't know either until my mom told me, Kiki
I think my constitution has completely changed
I'm trying to gain weight now
Yeah, I forgot too..
I just thought it was a mother louse
So which style do you like among the four?
Tsundere isn't that great, is it?
I like Yoo Yeon-seok the best too!
Jo Jeong-seok is good, but he is better than being good to everyone in the world...
Yeah, that sounds a bit odd
Can you recommend any life movies?
Life movie~
What genre?
Zootopia! I think I've seen it...
I think I've seen it about 10 times Kiki
Do you like Disney?
Yeah, I like it!
10 times? You must really like Kiki~
I'm just asking what my sister's life movie is, regardless of genre.
Arahan Jangpung Daeseon Kiki
I wanted to be like the main character here~
Oh, I've heard that name a lot, but I've never seen it!
What movie did you see recently?
I've only heard the name of that movie haha
Hmm I saw The Kissing Booth 3!
I'm going to the pipeline and Berlin~
I also saw a movie called Eleven O'Clock~
Oh, The Kissing Booth was popular. Did you watch all the series?
Yeah yeah! It's fun~
Just a light high teen!
I like such bright movies
I like disaster movies and horror movies Kiki
Do you like horror movies?
Oh, I like bright movies too...
I can't watch horror movies, Kiki
scared
Me too... I can't watch horror movies, but I watch disaster movies, but I don't like them that much because I have to watch them while feeling anxious ㅠㅠ
Oh, I saw a bright movie recently.
New Year's Eve~
Oh, is this the first time you've heard of this Korean film?
I've only heard the title, but I haven't seen it. What's it about?
Our country's movies~
There's also a flexible seat there~
An omnibus-style love story of four couples~
Can someone explain to me what an omnibus diet is...?
Oh, I don't know if you ask like that Kiki
It's the content for each of your couples, but isn't it somehow connected?
Yeah, it's a movie that ties together different stories with one theme.
Can I explain it like this?
Ahhh, I think I get it
Oh, Yoo Yeon-seok is coming out...
I'll have to see you later
Ah, there's a movie on Netflix called Perfect Man with Jo Jin-woong in it. I didn't really expect much from it, but it's super fun...
Check it out when you have time! Recommended Recommended
I like Mr. Jo Jin-woong~
It was really cool in Assassination~
I really need to watch the movies that are out now later Kiki
Everything looks fun
Are we having a ramen party today? Kiki
Yeah~ Yay, Song Songi is shooting today!
Kiki, guys, what kind of ramen are you going to eat today?
I'm already excited
When I eat cup ramen, I usually eat a large kimchi lid, but I'm craving it now that I see it haha
I don't know what kind of ramen to eat
Recommend it~!
Anyone tried Jjapaguri? Tell me what you think.
I've tried Jjapaguri, but I heard that Red Chicken Getty is tastier~
Both are delicious honestly haha
I'm going to eat carbonara buldak for the first time in a while
I think carbonara buldak is spicy too ㅠㅠ
The older sister next to me gave us some snacks, so we have some snacks too!
Carbonara Buldak is delicious, but it's spicy.
Sister, there's a fire tomorrow!
Are you talking about the turtle chips you were given back then?
I think I got it again? What kind of snack did you get?
No, turtle chips are at home
It's like nachos and corn chips, but they gave it to me in a paper cup Kiki
Good job, I left some to share.
Kiki no why are you both so cute
The one in the paper cup is really cute, and the one you left behind is cute too, Kiki
Oh, that older sister is really good at giving things haha
Song Songi, what did you give me!
Kiki gave me the tea I drink every day
I liked it because it was delicious haha
Kiki, that's just a courtesy to pretend it's delicious^^
Song Song, don't you have a conscience? Kiki
Kiki Ana? You said it was delicious, didn't you? Are you acting? Huh?
Why do you always spread tea to everyone around you?
No~ Kiki I have jelly today too, so I'll eat it for dessert
The food today is heaven
Happy, happy, happy, happy Lulu
Empty your stomach before 6 o'clock and eat a lot!
Okay I'm always ready Kiki
I'm already ready!
Do you like apartments or houses?
I love houses because of the elevator!
I don't know because I've never lived in a house.
But I want to live in a house with a garden!
With the dog
I also wanted to live in a house, but yard maintenance is no joke...
Puppy seriously ㅠㅠ The puppy you sent me earlier was really cute...
Kiki, that's right, I really took the picture but it looks like a doll
Please watch the video quickly ㅠㅠ
That's right, I was going to watch the video during lunch time, but I forgot and couldn't watch it Kiki
Oh, so why didn't you tell me, Song Song?
Kiki, I forgot to eat the food earlier because it was so delicious ^^
Have you seen Jang Dong-min's house on YouTube?
No, I saw Noh Hong-chul's house floating around, Kiki
Why Jang Dong-min's house?
Huh? Isn't that Jang Dong-min's house?
Oh my it's so big, everything is there
It was really good
Oh, come to think of it, I saw a pro show somewhere in the past
You said you poured it all out
Oh really? If I lived in a house like that, I'm confident I wouldn't leave the house...
Yeah, there's a golf course and a PC room in the basement, and there's also a rooftop. Hurry up and take a look, Kiki.
That's right, no, look at Noh Hong-chul's house too
Have you seen that huge drawing of your own face?
No, I think I've seen Noh Hong-chul's house...Kiki
Let's watch it later while eating ramen!
No, I haven't seen Kiki
What is Noh Hong-chul's house like?
It's so weird that you drew your own unique open-mouthed smile here and there.
And Noh Hong-chul also has obsessive-compulsive disorder, so he's incredibly clean...
It's more bizarre so Kiki
Kiki, I saw you draw something on your car a long time ago. Does it feel a bit like that?
I didn't see the car
I only remember that hopi pattern Kiki
I didn't even know I had obsessive compulsive disorder
You're obsessive-compulsive disorder, but it's amazing that you've grown that much of a beard.
There really isn't a speck of dust in the house...
It was on Infinite Challenge! Haha
Kiki: That's right, I saw that car on Infinite Challenge, and the drinks in the fridge were all cut to pieces!
Commuting is so hard, there are too many people ㅜㅜ
Ah seriously, there were too many today Kiki
It's been raining lately so I know there are more people
I can't even breathe, sob sob ㅠㅠ
It's supposed to rain again tomorrow ㅠㅠ
That's right, when it rains there are more people. Stop the rain!
When it rains, there are a lot of old men, so it gets even more annoying... Kiki
But they both come out early
Are there still a lot of people?
It's better than coming out late
So I'm going to leave early ㅜㅜ
But I find it strange that there aren't many people on the bus these days.
It's amazing. Kiki Line 4 is also really crowded, but unlike Line 2, there aren't any stations per line, so it's really worse than Line 2 ㅠㅠ
Save me
What do you mean there's one per station?
If you're going to pretend, pretend, you're going to pretend, Kiki!
You said the subway comes often, right?
Yes, if you look at the Kiki electronic board, there are stands at every subway station. Line 2
So I think line 2 is better
Oh, that's the story. Kiki said it strangely, so you couldn't understand it~
That's right, Line 2 is almost straight ahead.
Song Songi is like that ^^ I'm used to it now
Kiki, what are you doing guys?
You have to understand it right away, right?
Kiki, then tell me with sense from the beginning~
Kiki, your wish is too big Kiki
People who will go to work with me~ Let's suffer together, friends
It's nice to go to work together, but it's already painful enough
Sister, choose
Do you want to commute a little longer and a little less like me, or do you want to commute a little longer and take a little more time like I do now?
Haha... that's such an extreme choice
I like my commute to work
I will live a satisfying life too haha
Just wait a minute guys, I'll work hard to save up money and buy a car!
Kiki, everyone, please stop by my commute. It's fun^^
Sister, pick up your car and come pick me up.
It's not something that can be done just by pulling out a car...
I'll decline for now ^_^ haha
I have to go out and play with my sister next to me.
I have to watch out for the person riding next to me haha
Tell me what kind of part-time job you've had~
There are too many? Kiki, I'm almost in heaven
Then tell me the most unique thing you've ever done. I'm curious.
Yes, even if there are a lot, just tell me everything~ It's mandatory
Uh... Kiki, there wasn't anything special about it, but! The art center? I don't know.
Then, among the part-time jobs you both have done, is there one that you really don't recommend?
I just had a hard time because it was all restaurants... I hate the real ones
Yeah, the restaurant is the worst.
It was a real bar, so I threw up so much that I was vomiting...
Wow, working at a bar must be really tough Kiki
Have you both met some real people?
The bar is originally on a difficult level, Kiki
The difficulty level is higher than usual due to people getting drunk and turning into dogs.
I'll say it long, but...
Hey, first of all, the worst ones are the guys who tell you to pour them drinks.
I'm really pissed
Aren't you crazy?
I'm so pissed
Seriously, don't they have hands?
I was supposed to get pickles and stuff like that myself, but they asked me why it was self-service and asked if it was one drink, and when I asked if it was okay to order one, they kept saying it was definitely one, not two.
That guy got really angry when the boss saw him...
How can I live when I'm really dissatisfied with everything in the world?
Kiki, calm down, then tell me about the part-time job that made you happy
Momter was really comfortable
If you press the vibration bell, it will come to get it and if you finish eating, it will throw it away, but if you leave it, I can just clean it up.
Song Song Ah, that never happened... haha
You said you've been in the movie theater for a long time!
How was it
Kiki When you go to the cinema, you get to know a lot of people and become friends, so it's really fun. Kiki
But busy days are really hell
Have you seen all of Avengers?
Yeah, it's a great way to socialize at the movie theater.
Yeah, you saw Avengers?
Looking at my friends, it seems like it's a place for love, Kiki
I don't really like Avengers, so I don't know if I've seen them all!
During Avengers, our fire bell rang and people were watching the movie and evacuated and got a complaint and really...
I went home at 4am that time haha
Kiki, did someone press the fire bell or is it malfunctioning?
Oh really...? Then they would have shown the movie again? Kiki
Yeah, and I watched Avengers 3 times. It was so much fun!
When I come back from the military, I think I'll just feel like I've aged
That's right ㅠㅠ Even though I took a leave of absence and graduated, my friends were still going to school
My friend's boyfriend went into the military a while ago ㅠㅠ
The later you go, the bigger it seems Kiki
Wow, we're the same age, how long ago did he go?
You're really late, ROT?
No, I met a younger person and Kiki
But that guy also goes there late? He goes there after working.
Wow, at this age, I can't be a bear. I've never been a bear before~
Kiki, I think I've been doing it for three or four months...
Kiki I haven't met a police officer except for a little while
The police uniform is so cool though!
Yeah but I like the original uniform because it looks cool
Yeah I like the uniform Kiki
My old ideal type was someone with short hair that looked good on me like a soldier.
Oh really? I like really manly things.
But I also like that short hair suits me well
Yeah, Kiki. Are you and I really opposites?
Kiki, you haven't really thought about short hair?
Have all your boyfriends been in the military these days?
Kiki, it would be funny if you didn't go and come back
Wow! That's really fortunate.
I bought it, but I think I'll be sad if I send it...
Yeah, now all the guys my age have been in the military, so before dating you have to ask them if they have been in the military.
Kiki I still feel like I'm in the military
Yeah, I admit it...ㅠㅠ
Corona is forcing me to be like a bear sob sob sob
That's right, I absolutely can't do it
Sister, you're amazing!
Kiki, just stay still and don't think about anything
Let's just prepare for the test without thinking about anything.
Is everyone working hard to prepare for the certification exam?
I'm working hard haha
Let's run again today
I like it because we're all together these days haha
That's right, I need to practice here too to study well!
I'm glad it's all there now, really Kiki
Are the exercises going well?
I'm definitely doing well here
There are too many temptations at home...impossible
Yes, and at home, Kiki doesn't sit on a chair for long periods of time.
I can concentrate well here and it's really good
When you say temptation at Kiki's house, do you mean bed or bed or bed?
Kiki, oh right, it's so strong
And just sitting down at the desk is difficult.
Is it just me?
Me too Kiki and this one has a bigger screen and better seats
No, I was originally good at it at home.
But I'm used to big screens here, so the laptop is too uncomfortable.
Kiki: Then, from now on, until the exam, you'll have everything left, every single day? Both of you?
I want to stay longer after seeing the exercise situation ㅜㅜ
You have to lie about exercising or I'll call you and get mad!
What are you going to do about exercising now?
First of all... I have to go to the hospital this week. I definitely can't go next week. I'm not good enough to exercise yet.
Yeah, just two weeks, or let's be honest and ask for two weeks off!
Because I'm anxious, I might get sick more, really ㅠㅠ
So if you don't go next week, the exam is a week away, so it seems right to postpone it until the exam.
Yeah, I'll try my best
I have to study hard until the exam haha
Yeah right, haha I'm just going to watch it comfortably now~
I'll cheer for you guys ^_^ You should definitely get 1st class
Sister, you work so hard in this world, why are you suddenly like this?
Are you feeling very weak right now?
But you have to watch it with peace of mind
If you worry too much, it won't work!
Let's all study hard and get a level 1 so we can have a party!
No... I'm confused Kiki
You work hard and just eat comfortably, right?
Kiki, you know we have so many party plans right now
Let's go after the exam!
Do you always tell your family that you love them?
Uh... Really, really sometimes...?
Backback I think you'll do well
Something haha when you need something mom ~I love you~
Kiki what are you doing why are you answering me in advance
Actually it's me haha
Kiki daebak I surprisingly don't say I love you at all
It's something I've wanted to do since I was little, but I never did it, so now I can't do it...
Kiki is cute, Song Song-ah!
I tried to do it on purpose when I was older and it was really creepy.
Kiki-chan is funny
But I usually say I love you, but I feel like I always say let's be happy
Kiki, that's right, this should have been done naturally all along~
Kiki, you can do everything except love, act cute, and dance
You dance too? I'm embarrassed. Hey, Kiki, you're really cute.
Kiki's dance is so real that when I was in elementary school, I used to cover the TV and dance to it... Now...
Kiki TV cover dance is really Song Song unnie
I only dance when I feel like it now
Then why are you always trembling like this, Kiki?
Why is Kiki really drawn? I can see you
And Song Songi must have really had the highest level of difficulty raising children.
Kiki, wasn't that the kind of dance you were talking about?
You have to dance hot when you dance, Kiki, but your body
Kiki is right, parenting is really difficult...
No, what kind of dance are you talking about? I'm just dancing for fun...?
Kiki is so funny and hot
Hey, show me something hot later, Kiki
I wonder, oh really funny
Kiki no sorry but I'm also a blocker
It was gorgeous when I was young...
I'm shy now
Kiki no, you can do it, sister
Let's go to karaoke next time~
Wow, but do you guys go to karaoke with your family?
I think I've been there once? I went there often with my cousins!
What about you?
I used to go there often when I was young, but I haven't been there recently. Kiki
Me too Kiki, and my cousins are too old to begin with...
The youngest of the youngest families
Kiki, my mom was surprised when she saw me singing at the karaoke. Kiki
Why are you surprised to see Kiki sing?
I wonder if Kiki was just curious about singing
Kiki I'm a singer ~
Since we won't be together for a while, I'll just spit it out haha
At what age do you all plan on getting married?
Marriage... when
But I'm a little worried about getting married, Kiki
Men are men... Is there any guarantee that I won't cheat?
But I thought about that too
Even if it's not the wind, how can you live with one person for the rest of your life? I can't imagine this feeling.
No, guys, don't think that you can cheat, if you're going to cheat, break up and meet again...
Just get a divorce!
Ah Kiki, I got scolded by the little girl next to me a little while ago!
I'm not saying it's just like that~ It's just a small worry haha
Oh but I'm conservative so divorce is a bit much
I don't know because I haven't tried it yet, but Kiki
Kiki But I'm also a conservative, so I want to avoid divorce as much as possible, but if my husband makes up a reason for divorce, I have to get divorced. I don't want to put up with it.
What's wrong with that? Kiki!
Me too, same as you guys... Kiki
Still, divorce is better than living with it!
What if you have a baby?! ㅠㅠ The baby is sad
There's nothing we can do. If your husband cheated on you, you should divorce him. How can we live together?
No, that's extreme, Kiki
But these days there are a lot of DINK couples
Getting married without having children... I'm all for that.
Kiki I have been having second thoughts
I think it would be hard to raise them, but if I had another one, they would be so pretty
Yeah, but I still want to have a baby at least once in my life.
How cute and pretty she is because she looks like me^^ Kiki
Don't you have a lot to say...? I guess that's what you say in this situation haha
Anyway, it was something like, if you don't have children, it'll be easier to get a divorce...
I don't know why we're even thinking about divorce.
Kiki, that's extreme. I haven't even done it yet. Kiki
Who do you think will get married first?
Kiki, I'm not thinking about divorce X!
I think Song Song unnie will do it first!
Hmm, I think you'll be the first to do it.
Wow, but if you think about it, it feels like it's all going to be a little late Kiki
But why do you think I'll go first?
Kiki Me? No~ If you just say let's get married, Song Song, I think she'll say yes! Kiki
No, isn't that too easy? Kiki
Kiki, you guys should look after each other before that haha
Kiki, get tested with us before you get married!
Kiki, if you don't like it, I'll drag you out.
Kiki, I'll be watching you with eagle eyes
Go hard
Anyone who has ever raised a pet at home~
Me~ I raised a puppy haha
Wow, I've never raised one because my mom has allergies ㅠㅠ
What was your name?
Wow, I'm jealous. That's right. What was your name?
But since it was in the countryside where my house was, it was a country mongrel that we raised in the yard haha
Bangul was cute!
Hollang, you raised that famous Sigorjabjong? Show me.
Sigorjabjong Kiki I looked at it for a long time because it was a name I didn't know
Unfortunately, there is no picture of that kid... haha
Kiki I've never raised one because my mom has allergies ㅠㅠ
I want to raise a Pomeranian
I want to raise one too, but it costs too much money.
I don't have money and I don't have time to play with my dog.
Because I don't stay at home often
Has anyone ever raised an animal other than a dog?
I raised goldfish when I was little Kiki
You raised a child who resembles you, idiot! Haha
Kiki I also really wanted to raise a hamster when I was little, but I never got to raise one...sigh...
Yes, I have a hedgehog... My friend raised one so I wanted to raise one too.
Wow, your friend raised a hedgehog?
It's really cute...
But I can't hug you^^
My boyfriend raised a guinea pig or something Kiki
Yeah but if you want to get close you have to handle it
If we become friends later, we won't have to put up thorns
Guinea pigs really do make pig sounds...
Wow, that's amazing Kiki
No guinea pigs right now?
No, I think I raised it when I was young, it was funny to hear, something like Kiki
Also, if you look on YouTube, there are people who raise ducks. Has anyone seen them? They are all yellow.
When I was in 3rd grade of middle school, there were 5 people in my grade in a new city. My science teacher and I hatched chicks and ducks and raised them. Kiki
Oh, I think I told you this
I raised him until he became a chicken!
Kiki, that's right, I heard it last time
I saw someone raising an otter and the otters were really cute ㅠㅠ
After our exams, we go climbing, right?
Of course ~ but it has to be done with 4 or more people ㅠㅠ
What time do you close there?
Ending time? Are you talking?
It's 9 or 10 o'clock now...
But I think it was originally done until around 11 o'clock
Oh really? I wanted to go right away in September, but if this keeps up, I might not be able to go right away...? ㅠㅠ
But if there are two people who have been vaccinated, we can go as a group of four, so if Hyung-hyung and Unnie don't go, can't we go after Song-Song and Unnie have completed their vaccinations?
Oh Song Songi got her second dose, haha, that's right!
But if the regulations are relaxed, let's grab Hyung by the scruff of the neck and drag him away.
Kiki Gran! Should I bring my gym clothes?
What should I wear?
What about shoes?
If I go, I'll wear the leggings I wear when I exercise!
I think you can rent shoes there, right?
You and I have to go barefoot or we won't let you in haha
You're not wearing socks, you're barefoot?
It's nice not having to bring separate shoes, Kiki
Really? So you're climbing the rock wall barefoot?
No, I was trying to joke, but you guys are too serious.. haha
If you have climbing shoes, they'll rent them out to you!
Kiki, what are you kidding me?
Kiki Ana, I really believe it because I don't know anything
Kiki, somehow I saw videos and pictures of them doing that, and they were all wearing special shoes!
So of course I thought I would borrow it but I was surprised Kiki
Idiots~ Let's just teach that class when we get there!
I think it was 30,000 won!
Climbing shoes are included too!
Whew, how to really land? I have to learn it well.
It's scary, I'm afraid my back will break. Kiki
Of course, since it's my first time and I don't know anything, I have to take a class!
Yeah but it's nothing special Kiki
And I've been sick for two days now...
The next day I felt so good that I thought, &quot;What? I'm so strong?&quot; and then Kiki
It was a bit difficult because muscles I hadn't used at all were stiff.
Kiki, if you come with me, I don't know if you'll be sick in bed Kiki
Let's go on Friday, no matter what!
Kiki Sister, why do my muscles hurt so late?
The response is really slow. You have to go on Friday no matter what!
This uses the deep muscles... I got really sore and started feeling pain in strange places.
But if you go with me, you'll have to ride a lot
I'll just take a break and keep riding
This will be really fun
If it's fun, go often!
Do you all have a favorite game?
I don't play games these days ~ but sometimes I steal Anipang from my sister and play, and I use up all my hearts and give them to her...
I'll even empty your mailbox haha
Kiki loves board games!
Let's go play board games too. It'll be so much fun.
I like board games too!
If we go there, it'll be a total mess. It'll probably end with Hyung and Unnie explaining the game rules. Kiki
No, I'm already stressed out Kiki
It's so funny to think that you'll be keeping your mouth shut...
Kiki is already stressed out. That's hilarious. Kiki
But I think it might be like that, Kiki
Ah, I can already see that we're going to be noisy
Looks like we're going to take over there...
Kiki, that's why you're stressed, but it's funny Kiki
Our real one is going to be really noisy Kiki
Uh... Kids, you have to listen to what I say, Kiki, okay?!
Kiki, when you get there, bring the mic now.
It looks like my voice will be buried~
Kiki, right, even if you win, if we raise our voices, it'll probably just get buried
I guess I'll have to look for a microphone starting today...
I can already imagine my throat getting sore Kiki
Kiki, that's funny
Just imagining it makes me think there's so much we can do ^^
Do you have a favorite board game?
We have to get together first
And there are a lot of fun ones, but I can't remember their names ㅜㅜ
If I ask what Clue is, will you tease me again? Kiki
Sister, don't you know that?
Actually, I don't know either! Haha, what is it?
Kiki is cute^^
But even if you don't know this, it's not something to be teased about
It's famous, but if you don't play board games well, you might not know about it.
It's a game to find the culprit and the murder weapon.
What is this, a brain game Kiki?
It must be very crowded and difficult
You have to teach us all!
Don't be angry!
Kiki, I'm okay, let's take care of each of us one by one! Hehe
Kiki, you're so confident, I like it
And these days, if you ask a part-timer there to explain it to you, they will do it for you, so you can use the opportunity to have someone else explain it to you.
Song Song, this is ridiculous haha, we are one ^^
Since it's Kiki, I'll tell you. If it wasn't for Kiki, I wouldn't have told you and just played the game~
Oh but I feel like it would take an hour to learn one game. Kiki
Kiki, have you ever been to a board game cafe?
Me once? I think I've been there!
I think I went there sometimes Kiki
Do you go as a group or as a couple?
Is there a place you want to travel to?
I really really want to travel abroad these days ㅠㅠ
Me, America... Seriously... I bought a ticket, but because of Corona... My trip to America was thwarted... Hehe... Anyone who has been to America?
I haven't been to America ㅜㅜ
I want to travel abroad too
I want to go to Prague, Czech Republic when the coronavirus is over
I haven't been to the US either ㅠㅠ
The Grand Canyon is crazy... I definitely want to go!
My trip to Europe was also canceled...
I thought of the Grand Canyon, but I read an article about a Korean who fell while taking pictures there... It was really scary.
Oh, I saw that too...
I'm scared. You have to be careful when you go to my sister's house.
No, really? This is my first time hearing about it...
This is really crazy ㅠㅠ
I just imagined Kiki and my legs started shaking
Why do you want to go to Prague?
The night view there is really pretty
I've wanted to go there for a while ㅜㅜ
After I heard that my high school teacher Sam went to study abroad in the Czech Republic, I saw the picture and it was so pretty that I also ranked Europe first ㅠㅠ
Kiki, really? When can we go again?
I wonder if I can go next year ㅠㅠ
Yeah, I'm really going to include Czech Republic as a must-visit destination when I travel Europe...
But even if we don't have corona, will we be able to go if we keep working?
It has to be released next year, no matter what...
If it doesn't work out, I'll cry... I'll go no matter what!
Sister, shouldn't you go to Australia first?
Let's go to Delco together!
Take me~ We are one
We have to go together~
Because it has to be released next year unconditionally ㅠㅠ
You guys are a little tired
Follow me quietly haha
So he's giving you a tour of Australia? Wow
Kiki he really likes tour kiki
Let's welcome the real thing!
Oh Kiki, but you know what?
He can't go anywhere either
Kiki we may have to do it
Kiki-chan is funny
Then why don't we go on tour together?
Kiki Really? Then let's go together and interpret.
Why don't I study hard so I can do it~ haha
Kiki, are you going to Australia this year?
It was supposed to rain this morning. Did you all bring umbrellas?
Of course ~ I brought an umbrella!
But the weather was cool and not humid today, right?
I think so, but I don't remember, Kiki
Oh I was so tired this morning I didn't have time to feel the weather Kiki
Kiki I came by subway today and I came with plenty of time to spare.
But I was so sleepy that I felt like I had my eyes closed the whole time
Yeah, but they said the rain would stop in the afternoon
Yeah, I'm so sleepy
It stopped after 6 o'clock!
I'm also really sleepy today for the first time in a long time ㅠㅠ
Take a picture later when it stops raining~ Bbaekbaek!
Kiki, you're right. Do I have to take a picture today too?
Yeah yeah I'll take a picture when it stops raining~
Or after it's over!
Okay! I'll just finish it and take a picture before it gets dark haha
I think summer clothes are almost over now Kiki
I think I'll be able to wear long sleeves soon!
Yeah, it's starting to get cold
It's cold even at night
Yeah, I think I still need to carry a thin outer layer ㅠㅠ
It's cold now when I turn on the air conditioner
I have a feeling it's going to get colder after this rain stops, don't you?
Yeah, I think so too
Also, the temperature difference between day and night seems to be severe ㅜㅜ
Yeah, when it rains, the weather changes a lot...
Let's take care of ourselves before our exam... ㅠㅠ
Don't catch a cold!
Kiki, that's right. It's cold when you go out in the morning, but the subway is hot and it's hard to adjust the temperature, so it's perfect for catching a cold.
Really be careful
That's right, it's the perfect weather for catching a cold. Let's all dress warmly.
But I'm still cold
My hands are so cold...
Really? I feel just fine when I put on my clothes!
Does the air conditioner keep blowing in that direction?
But I think the air conditioner is turned off now, but is it still cold?
The air is better now, but my hands still feel numb
Because it was already too cold
touch my arm
It's warm now! Kiki
Kiki, if it's too cold, I'll give you my clothes!
Did you see the motorcycle accident in Seolleung the other day?
I was surprised when I saw it this morning...
In Seolleung?! I didn't know ㅠㅠ
Did you see it on your way to work?
What's going on?
Explain the situation
No, I didn't see it myself, but I saw it on Facebook this morning and it was a mess.
A motorcycle cut in front of a truck waiting at a traffic light, but the truck couldn't see it because it was tall, so it just drove off when the light turned green...
Wow... What? So it's completely installed?
The motorcyclist is dead, right? ㅠㅠ
So...what happened?
curious
Yeah, I got crushed and died...
As soon as I hit Seolleung, my sister and I watched the black box footage.
If you're scared, don't watch Song Song...
No, seriously, it's too bad...
I bet truck drivers are also very traumatized?
Wow... so vain
Seriously how can that be so scary
So, the drivers who saw the accident directly from the opposite side must have had a hard time mentally...
But when I watched the video, it was even scarier because it seemed so possible
So what happened in the morning? We have to be careful too ㅠㅠ
Here, motorcycles are also going around like crazy
That's right, the motorcyclists don't obey traffic signals and just dodge around, driving around so dangerously...
I watched the video for nothing
My impression still hasn't cleared up...
Can't we all just honestly follow the traffic laws and live like this... ㅠㅠ
So, you have to be especially careful on rainy days like this ㅠㅠ
Even people who actually saw it would probably be shocked and scared
That's right, everyone, please follow the traffic lights and laws...
Looking at the video, it seems like that accident wasn't just the motorcycle driver's fault ㅠㅠ
No and first of all, we really need to get rid of the motorcycle
I always feel like I'm on a vehicle that's too dangerous to ride
Kiki, no, it's good to ride safely, but if you enjoy the thrill, the biggest problem is that it causes harm to others.
Let's enjoy the thrill alone...
Yeah, but if they get rid of all the motorcycles and the food delivery is late, there's going to be a fuss about it being late
That's the problem with Korea!
Hurry up, hurry up! But I like it when it's hurry up Kiki, a native Korean...
But motorcycles are too dangerous
I was really trying to lower the interest rate a little bit, but it really went by so quickly... ㅠㅠ
Has anyone ever ridden a Kiki motorcycle?
I have never
I don't have one either. I've never ridden in the back.
Ah, I rented one when I went on a trip to Gyeongju and rode in the back... I never wanted to ride it again Kiki
Kiki, let's all be careful!
You know, there's chaos in Afghanistan these days, right?
Oh my, the withdrawal of US troops caused a total mess ㅠㅠ
What? I don't know because I didn't look properly, but what's going on?!
The Taliban took over there and it was total chaos ㅜㅜ
There's chaos as everyone left there tries to leave quickly.
Yeah, yeah ㅠㅠ But they brought a few hundred people to our country too, and people started petitions asking people not to bring refugees.
Oh really? But can I bring it to our country right now?
I guess opinions will be completely divided for and against?
It's pitiful, but if they come to our country again, then we should do something about it... People are making a fuss about if we're going to bring in refugees, we should at least help the homeless. Kiki
Yeah, there was even an operation called &quot;bringing in people who worked with our country and their families&quot; like that!
Thank goodness everyone arrived safely
Wow, but I can't even imagine that something like that would happen in this day and age.
It's a story that you would only see in olden times, but...
I thought the same thing when I saw it
And the parents of the babies threw the babies into the iron cage of the embassy to try to save them...
But there are also babies that died because they were thrown wrong ㅜㅜ
I even saw a soldier holding a baby ㅠㅠ
You could be in danger too...
This is exactly what we see in the movies...
It's really scary if we think about it.
Yeah, it's terrible
And I especially hate how they treat women like objects...
Oh my gosh ㅠㅠ So women are protesting in front of soldiers holding guns
That's really great too
Wow, you're doing that with the intention of getting shot, wow...
Wow, this is really amazing
If it were me, I would have just lived in hiding ㅜㅜ
Yeah, but if I don't do that, nothing will change, so I'll just do it on my knees... ㅠㅠ
But I really feel like it's not someone else's business
To be honest, I'm a little scared when we hear talk about the withdrawal of US troops from our country.
Now, if war breaks out, we'll all die together, right? Kiki
Yeah, especially if you go back and forth with a nuclear bomb, it's just over Kiki
We also don't really feel like we are in a different situation because of North Korea.
Admit it... If I'm going to die, I want to die without pain^^ Sigh...
Speaking of North Korea, I thought of this. Did you see Kim Jong-un die? At the airport?
I saw it on YouTube again and it gave me goosebumps
Yes, I saw that he died, but I saw it on YouTube and wanted to watch it, but I forgot. I guess I'll have to watch it!
Oh no? Show me later when we eat!
Yeah, tell me, I might forget later!
Has anyone ever tried nail art?
I tried it once! Kiki
But it was so frustrating that I tore it all apart in a week.
Kiki I got it when my friend just started learning nail art.
It was really pretty and I liked it, but what about you?
I haven't tried it
It's so pretty that I want to try it at least once, but I'm the type that just puts on nail polish and takes it all off, so it's 100% frustrating to death
No, this is the first time I've applied it since elementary school?
But really, how do you do that?
It's so frustrating, really
Kiki I think I can do it well if I'm told to do it
But it's a bit sad that we can't have long nails, even though they are pretty if they are long...?
If you tell me to go, I think I can go! It's pretty
Really? I just want to try it once... It's uncomfortable~
If we do it, we'll do it in a flashy way, Kiki
Ugh Kiki but my friend used to get her nails done every day but now she got nail fungus and can't do anything Kiki
Is that because your hands can't breathe?
Wow, nail fungus is crazy. I've never heard of it before. Kiki
Why is the texture like that Kiki
Well, getting your nails done is good, but now we're not good at removing them either, so isn't that a bit annoying?
Wow, this is the first time I've heard of nail fungus.
That's right, lazy people like me can't do it because of the deletion...
I have to go back to get my gel nails removed again.
Yeah haha I got my hair done for the first time this summer and it's already long so I'm holding back because I'm too lazy to go get it taken off...
But I've never received it at a shop. What do you think?
Wow, show me your long, pedicured toenails! Kiki
Kiki I was a little embarrassed because my feet were ugly ^^
I have almost no baby nails, so when I apply it, I pretend it's a nail and apply it to my skin Kiki
But they created it for me this time when I went
Kiki is so funny. Why are you putting that on your body? Kiki is ridiculous.
Kiki, my little toenails have almost disappeared after falling off a few times...
You are so thick, Kiki
I just don't have any...
No, it's funny if there's no kid, so I just pretended there was one!
Are you dissatisfied?!
I'll have to see you both later. Why did your toenail fall off again?!
No, sis, you've never seen mine, so why are you trading so much?
I wore my shoes wrong once and they fell off, but after that, they kept falling off...
Really? I thought I saw toenails when you were wearing sandals, but did I see Kiki?
Song Song Ah, and I won't show you today, I'm wearing socks!
Oh, what are you doing! Oh my, but I've never fallen for it and I just went around with it painted in blue because I was dazed. Kiki
No, it's ridiculous that you painted it blue when you were drunk, Kiki
Kiki, you're so sisterly
Seriously, what are you doing?
Why is everyone so comedic, really Kiki
Kiki, no, it's embarrassing because it doesn't come out easily when you get bruised!
Let's get health checkups even though we're young...
You're going for an endoscopy this week!
I need to tell you a review
Kiki, I'm curious because I've never had an endoscopy before.
If I wake up under anesthesia, won't it hurt?
That's why I'm scared because it's my first time too
What should I do if something goes wrong with me?
Oh, but I don't think I've ever heard a review saying that sleep endoscopy is painful?
There are a lot of reviews that are just nonsense like that Kiki
I wonder what Kiki's nonsense will be called
Are you going with your parents?
Yeah, my mom said she'd go with me haha
I want to sleep quietly~
Kiki, will it be done by your will?!
But you can't do that without a guardian?
But what if there is no one to go? ㅠㅠ
But my mom had an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy while sleeping during a health checkup, and she went alone.
Oh really? I asked because if I did it, I'd probably have to go alone haha
Kiki But guys, which do you think is worse for your health, drinking two cups of strong Americano every day or drinking a sugary drink every day?
Kiki, is it too difficult...? Isn't it similar...?
Kiki I said neither of them were good!
Both need to be reduced
But when I saw it, I didn't like the sweet one much
Sugar is really bad for you!
Kiki No, I said I was more worried about Americano, but I got scolded by my sister earlier Kiki
Kiki and I are both worried about each other
I don't know if Americano is bad for your stomach or if something sweet is bad for you
If you don't like quick reactions, choose Americano!
Kiki: No, but the sweet stuff just absorbs everything...
Especially since he drinks a lot of liquids, they just absorb them straight into his bloodstream.
Kiki, you had similar thoughts to me
Yeah, I think I drink a lot more these days ㅠㅠ I can't stop eating sweets
I didn't know you like sweets either, Kiki
But it's so amazing how you can taste sweetness differently Kiki
If I eat it, my tongue will be numb, but you guys are delicious! Or maybe it's not enough
Kiki Maybe because the two of us don't drink much coffee, we're used to sweets and that might be why it's so bad?
That's right, but I was curious so I looked it up and it says that if you exceed the amount of sugar you can store, it becomes neutral fat.
I guess I'm just gaining weight
Coffee is worse~
No! I have diabetes. Be careful, Kiki. Okay?
I'm trying to cut down on coffee a lot these days!
Kiki That's right! I admit I don't drink these days.
Flip is pretty these days
People around me keep switching from iPhone...
Hey seriously... I came here this morning after watching tech youtuber reviews haha
That thing is seriously waterproof, no joke
Samsung is crazy
Kiki, I think I saw you
It's okay to just put it in the ice cup. The pink and green review Kiki colors are pretty.
Oh, I can't see it
But it's amazing that people who have Apple Watches are selling them to buy them. I don't think I'll do it because it's too much of a hassle...
Oh Song Song, that wasn't it haha
And I don't mean to be joking, but there's no pink... ^^
What! Kiki, you saw the same thing as me
I also watched Flip on YouTube a while ago
Kiki, what is it? Then what is the pink color that Song Song saw?
I think I mistook lavender for pink... but it's a bit different, Kiki
Or maybe you confused it with the hologram in version 2?
Kiki Lavender Yeah that's Kiki No anyway it's pretty!
Kiki aha kiki you look pretty
But I think the Galaxy is too short horizontally and too long vertically, so the design isn't my style ㅜㅜ
Oh, that's right. When I looked at the review today, I saw that the YouTube subtitles are cut off a bit when watching the video horizontally.
But the camera is really good...
Galaxy, but the back is okay, but the front is not so great, right?
Oh really? I don't know about that, but I didn't like it since long ago because of the design, but the subtitles being cut off is too much.
Yeah, it's famous for being a Galaxy cucumber, is that okay?
Galaxy? Isn't iPhone really that bad?
It was the same when we took our picture yesterday
No, it's cucumber galaxy Kiki
I too was a Galaxy fan and stuck with the Note, but after using the iPhone, I've always used the iPhone!
Yesterday, I didn't know if it was that cucumber, but my sister said it was, so I thought it was Kiki
When taking selfies with Galaxy, your face becomes really long, especially towards the edges rather than the center.
Wow, really? I don't really like Samsung electronic devices, so I've never used them, so I didn't know. Kiki
But this time the design is really pretty
But Samsung has been hearing that a lot lately, so isn't it no longer a cucumber?
I want to see the real flip too
I haven't seen it yet
But I've never used Samsung either Kiki
I'll take a selfie with dad, okay? Kiki
It's pretty, but I don't know if it's that pretty because my dad's is black.
Oh great! Is the flip black?
The black flip is really pretty...but it's even prettier in person, I saw it yesterday
Oh right, I saw the black one yesterday Kiki
Oh right, and as far as I know, only the black one is matte!
Really? I don't like black phones. Kiki
Then whoever buys a flip~
Kiki I want to experiment with what people around me use...
Samsung needs to think more about it because they don't want the screen to be distorted
Oh, are you thinking of changing it?
I haven't changed for long Kiki
Sisters, do you have a favorite celebrity?
But I always change Kiki
If I watch this drama, I like him, and if I watch that drama, I like him...
But I think I said it before, but I like Kim Sung-cheol consistently these days
I only follow this person on Instagram among celebrities.
Kiki I think Kim Seon-ho from Il-Nam-Il-Il is cool these days!
you?
But why do you like Kim Seong-cheol?
Because you sing well?
Every time I watch a drama, my favorite person changes Kiki
Kiki, actually, that's not really my style?
But it appeared in my dream and I felt better
Do you remember what I told you, Kiki?
Kiki, what was that? Tell me again.
Kiki, I think we talked about this before
I probably only talked to Bakbak Kiki
I had a dream about Kim Seong-cheol before, and I kept thinking about him, so I started liking him after that.
Kiki Kim Sung-chul but he looks like my sister's boyfriend!
Kiki, really? They don't look alike to me.
No, they don't look alike
Why are you teasing our Seongcheol?!
Kiki, why! It's good, you met your ideal type.
Kiki didn't say she was my ideal type, she just said she liked me but she wasn't my type!~
Phew! Seriously Kiki. So who do you guys like?
I originally really liked Song Joong-ki
You're so cool Kiki
I don't have one~ It keeps changing, but these days Junho is sexy and okay
Very foxy Kiki
No, you're not Kiki Auntie, you're Kiki the Fox Kiki
This is the real Fox Song Kang...
Seriously, everything from his physique to his face is crazy ㅠㅠ
Now all I have to do is act well!
I'm seeing Kiki Oh for the first time and he's handsome. His acting reminds me of him. But isn't Sung Hoon from I Live Alone also cool?
Song Kang liked it for a little while when he cried...
It passed by quickly^^
Seonghoon is totally not my style...
I really don't like it that much
Wow... Sunghoon, I feel so burdened Kiki
You have similar tastes to my friend Song Song-ah
Kiki, do I like slightly dark people?
I guess so, I don't like strong people Kiki
It's burdensome
I like slightly slanted eyes
My friend also likes strong people
That friend said that Cha Eunwoo and Choi Kang Changmin are handsome
Oh... but those two are really handsome, Kiki
But Kiki is a bit far from my ideal type
Listening to you, it seems like Backback and I have similar ideal types
Kiki Cha Eunwoo has a face that makes you believe he's a real face genius
He's so handsome I'm actually curious
What is your favorite movie genre, ladies?
There's nothing special about it!
But I don't really watch noir or horror movies...
Kiki I like Roco. It's sweet and funny. Kiki
Someone recommend me a romantic comedy movie~
When I actually asked, I couldn't think of any romantic comedy.
I actually don't remember the movie title very well ㅜㅜ
Have you seen Kiki A Kissing Booth too? Song Song, right?
Kiki Oh wow I just saw that!
It was fun
Oh yeah I like that feeling Kiki
I saw that too Kiki
I've watched up to part 2, but part 3 came out so I'm going to watch it soon!
Yeah Kiki that's funny
But did you know that the two main characters dated and then broke up and filmed season 2?
Kiki, really? Money is this scary, you guys.
Are you going to film season 2 and then buy it again?
How is it?
Oh right, I heard you broke up Kiki
But in foreign countries, you can be friends with your ex-lover and be very free.
I heard you were meeting your ex-husband and current husband together.
There's not really anything like that, right?
I think I saw the interview but I don't remember Kiki
I just thought, &quot;Oh, I cheated...&quot; and moved on.
Season 2, but didn't the male protagonist change? He became black.
I couldn't watch till the end of 2
In the end, I found out that she reconciled with her original boyfriend
Hmm... I don't think the main character changed?!
But that setting is funny Kiki
First-year students at Harvard University are required to live in a dormitory, so I was looking for a house to live with them.
As far as I could see, the two of them were becoming long-distance friends and growing apart, but then a black transfer student came to visit and they started to become a little closer?
Aha, this is really early days, but watch Kiki again
After seeing that, watch part 3 too
What, I barely saw it haha
See you again!
I watched Kiki 1 and then watched the second one right after, and it got boring so I turned it off
Recommend again
Yes, sister, recommend me
I just like romance too
It's burdensome^^ Kiki
I'll have to check out Netflix a bit, I think I'll remember Kiki
But if you like old movie vibes, The Notebook is also fun
Oh, really? I heard that the notebook is really famous, but I still haven't seen it. Is this true...?
Ah, I think I was trying to look at my laptop, but I think I turned it off because it was a bit boring.
Clementine, I think I enjoyed that one
If you don't like the old fashioned feel of the notebook, don't watch Kiki
It might be boring...
Clementine I didn't see that!
See you later ~haha
Kiki I like old school sentimental movies
Have you seen Notting Hill?
What's for lunch today?
I'm still undecided...
Give me some recommendations Kiki
Since you mentioned mala-tang earlier, I want to eat it, so I'm going to order mala-tang!
Wow, is there really a good spicy hotpot restaurant there?
There's a restaurant 5 minutes away from my house where people have to wait in line to eat~
Wow, I want to go there too!
I'm serious about Mala Tang Kiki
You know there's a good restaurant in Suwon~
Oh, there! They don't open for lunch these days ㅠㅠ Because of Corona
Oh my god, you can't open it because of Corona? Is that true?
Yeah, they only do delivery these days, so I have to go there and eat there.
So, originally, mala-tang should be eaten on the spot to enjoy it properly ㅜㅜ
Yes, the freshly fried kuay bao rou is so delicious Kiki
Oh, are you talking about the kuabaorou we ate together last time?
Yeah right I love that so much Kiki
I also totally love it. I want to eat it again. ㅜㅜ
Let's go eat next time, come quickly Kiki
Are you thinking of living alone when you get a job this time?
Yeah, that's right. I want to live alone soon.
If you go, which area do you want to go to?
Maybe I should go to Daejeon? It's nice there.
Send me to Daejeon too ㅜㅜ
Daejeon is really a great place to live!
Is living in Seoul really hard? ㅠㅠ
Let's go down together!
First of all, living alone is so lonely ㅜㅜ
Oh really? Let's find a two-room apartment together and go, Kiki
It'll probably be cheaper there than in Seoul, right?
Yeah, that's right, half. Kiki, this is it!
Is the real price real?
Send me to Daejeon ㅜㅜ
Okay, let's look into real estate together. Kiki, come down~
Okay, I'll cut the refund fee down a lot!
I'll look for you with my eagle eyes Kiki
We're going to be a fantastic duo!
Yeah, that's right, jump south!
Where did you go on the shuttle bus last time?
Oh, that's Everland Safari Kiki
Oh, where can I get that?
There's an amusement park called Safari World, and I took a bus there.
That bus design was really cute ㅜㅜ
Yes, I saw the animals up close through the window Kiki
Wow, wow, weren't you scared?
Yeah, it's really sturdy and safe, Kiki
Was there a bar on that window?
Yeah, that's right, it's okay because the bars are all safe.
I see. I've never been to a place like that in 25 years of living. ㅜㅜ
There are so many places you haven't been to, sis ㅠㅠ
So, give me a shuttle bus ride too~!
Would you like to take a shuttle bus and go see the animals together?
Do I have to pay for the shuttle bus?
No, it's included in the admission ticket. Kiki
When will the results come out for the place you interviewed at last time?
The result is still like this Kiki is really riding the shit rope Kiki
As expected from a public corporation, Kiki is very relaxed
Yeah, I applied to other places too!
Oh really? You applied for an office job?
Yeah, that's right, the general affairs and finance and accounting teams.
But you can do it because you have a qualification that will help you get a good job!
Thank you Kiki
But these days, I want over specs so it falls short ㅠ
Yeah, these days, if you look at people's specs, they're no joke.
Are you building up your specs well?
Then I'm going to go to a Photoshop academy soon and Kiki, I hope you get a job!
Wow, wow, how much does that academy cost?
You can learn while working part-time at a school!
Huh? Is that even possible?
They're looking for an information desk worker
If you take the class while doing that, you'll get a discount Kiki
Then it's a total win-win situation. Apply now!
Okay, I get it! Let's give it a try~
Where did your brother get his sleeping arrangements?
Ah, there's Paju, northern Gyeonggi Province. Kiki
Huh? Didn't you say you went somewhere else at first?
That's a training camp and they moved to another place Kiki
Oh, that's the training camp.
How long was your time at the training camp?
Maybe about 4 weeks? I'm not sure about that either ㅠㅠ
That's right, Nonsan is also 4 weeks, but I guess all trainees are the same!
Okay, Kiki, anyway, I'm in Paju now.
Then, would it be easy to come to Suwon in Gyeonggi-do?
Yeah Kiki but it's been a long time since I've been out Kiki
So when you came back on vacation, did your little dad come pick you up?
No, I heard you can get there by public transportation Kiki
You're an adult, you're an adult
But you're getting discharged early~
Yeah, I think I'll see your face soon ㅠㅠ
I want to see that fat pig's face~
You'll see a lot soon...
What are you studying these days?
I'm studying video editing these days Kiki
Right, you're working with that, right?
Insta reels are trending these days, so I'm learning them too Kiki
I understand Instagram, but what are Reels?
It's a short video of less than 30 seconds.
Is that popular these days?
Is that like TikTok?
Yeah right, it's like TikTok. Kiki, learn that.
Oh, but now I know why Korean kids switched to reels!
Yeah? Why are you changing?
I heard that TikTok is a Chinese app and that they can steal personal information!
Oh, that's too much ㅜㅜ
I'll have to do it in reels from now on
Reels, can we do that too?
It's a little difficult, but you'll learn it quickly. Try Kiki.
No, we should do it together. Teacher Rils, please tell me~
Ah, I'll learn it properly and tell you everything, Kiki
Did Little Daddy and Little Mommy both get their shots?
Oh, are you talking about the vaccine?
Yeah, everyone got the first one right?
Yeah, that's right. Pfizer Kiki doesn't hurt that much.
You got Pfizer. Are you having any symptoms?
My arm is swollen and my head hurts a little bit ㅠㅠ
Was Grandma right?
Yeah, my mom got the first one too!
Oh, so you don't have any symptoms?
Oh, it wasn't there, but after a week, the area I was hit swelled up!
They say that if you take Tylenol regularly, you'll get better.
That's why my sister bought that medicine!
Oh, good job! When will you meet me?
I'm going to wear a mask and go out hehe
Yeah, it's still a little scary ㅠㅠ
That's right! This time, it came out that someone in their 20s died!
Yes, we also have to think about getting vaccinated.
You went to Busan this time since it's your 400th day?
Yeah, that's right, I went on a date~
I'm jealous. Wasn't your boyfriend two years younger than you?
Yeah, that's right, Kiki, born in 2000
Are there people born in 00 in this world?
Hey, these days, everything is 00s ㅠㅠ
Wow, that's awesome. How many days have you been here?
2 nights and 3 days! It's 400 days so I went to eat steak Kiki
Oh, you went to cut the meat~
Yeah, it's our anniversary, so we should do that much~
I just sent it simply because it was our first anniversary last month
Oh, it's already been a year
I don't even remember haha
How long has it been since you and your boyfriend met?
I recently checked and it was 2500 days.
Wow... That's great. When are you getting married?
I haven't thought about it yet, I'm only 25
But damn, everyone around me keeps texting me saying they're getting married.
Hey, it's coming soon Kiki
I need to eat quickly~ ^^
If you live alone, do you plan on raising a pet?
I have a dog, a cat, and a hamster!
Are you talking about growing three types at the same time?
No, I'm going to keep increasing it!
What breed of dog do you want to raise?
I want to raise a Bichon puppy, it's so cute
Ah, that guy wakes up with his head in a mess, he's so cute ㅜㅜ
Yeah, it looks like the clouds are jumping around Kiki ㅠㅠ
Okay, then I can ask my older sister for beauty care~
That's a good idea Kiki. Kiki.
Does your sister have a pet?
Our Obok is my favorite pet~
Oh Bok-i, is there anything that hurts?
I'm taking medicine every two days now ㅜㅜ
Oh my gosh ㅠㅠ My heart hurts so much
Now my sister and mom are taking turns feeding it!
I wish there would come a day when we don't have to take medicine! Our Obok
Is there any exercise you want to do these days?
I want to learn climbing~
If you climb, you'll get it right away~
Oh, did you learn climbing, sis?
Yeah, I'm in the intermediate class.
Do you know that you can also divide that by a series?
Wow, that's great
What do you need to climb?
That's also an exercise that requires skill~
What skills do you need?
First of all, you need to have basic core strength, and you'll know it as you keep doing it~
Yeah, unnie, your core is really good~ I'm jealous!
Yeah~ I don't have any, but I got a lot of compliments for distributing my strength well overall~
Wow, how much does it cost?
When I did it, it was 100,000 won per month and 240,000 won in 3 months!
And I need to buy shoes too!
It's so cheap
The instructor taught me?
Yes, there is a teacher who teaches you!
Oh, I should learn it too!
You said you play Overwatch, right?
Yeah that's right but I'm doing something different these days
Wow, the world really does turn fast. What are you doing?
So, do you know Kiki Battle Ground?
Bag, you know, you know, I've done that too~
Oh really? That was a bit difficult. How was it?
Yeah, that's why I got headshots all the time~
Okay, Kiki, do you want to do it together next time?
If we do it together, we'll all be wiped out. Of course, that includes us.
I just want to give you the items Kiki
Right Kiki, I should follow you around and pick up things too~
Then, Kiki's strategy is to get into the top 10~
Kiki, have you ever tried chicken?
Wow, I want to try chicken ㅠㅠ
At first, I thought they were giving me real chicken too~
That's not it Kiki
I want to eat chicken!
Where was your last overseas trip?
When was the last time I went on a trip abroad? The last time was Japan!
Did you go there because you wanted to eat ramen back then?
Yes, I think I went on a day trip to eat ramen. Kiki
There's no one like you around me who can go to Japan for a day trip!
What should I do when I miss Ichiran Ramen? ㅠㅠ
Oh, but that ramen place is really delicious!
Sister, you went to Japan too! Where did you go?
I've been to Osaka and Fukuoka!
Oh, I went to Fukuoka too!
How many days did you travel to Fukuoka?
I go there so often that I don't remember ㅠㅠ
Wow, seriously, if it weren't for Corona, you would be flying right now!
That's right, my body is aching ㅠㅠ
So you went to Busan, which is the farthest place?
Yeah Kiki, I'm glad I can go there!
What is your favorite season?
I like summer because it's warm
Wow, I haven't seen anyone around me who likes summer!
Isn't that rare?
I hate the cold ㅠㅠ
Then you don't turn on the air conditioner?
Turn on the air conditioner, but don't cover yourself with a blanket!
But that's the happiest national rule!
Yeah, but I'm sad that summer is ending now ㅠㅠ
That's right, it's raining autumn now and it's going to get cold when this is over ㅜㅜ
Really? It's time to buy fall clothes now~
I also need to buy some fall clothes. Do you want to go shopping together?
Yeah, okay
There are a lot of fall clothes coming out these days, Kiki
Yeah, I've seen it in a lot of commercials too. Kiki tells you to buy some of their clothes.
Kiki, yeah, good
Let's go sometime~
Okay, let's take the other sisters too~
Yeah, I need to buy some clothes before it gets cold~
Did you see the article about the young mother who threw her newborn baby in the trash can?
Oh really? I haven't watched the news lately ㅠㅠ
As soon as the baby was born, she threw it in the food waste bin!
Wow, is that a person? I wonder if it's a devil ㅠㅠ
So, they said that people found that baby after 3 days!
That's a relief ㅠㅠ
Is that woman in custody?
I haven't gotten that far, but won't I be arrested?
That person should be arrested. He's really bad.
I know that girl is a teenager!
Huh? Really? You're young...
Yeah, right? But that doesn't mean you should throw away your life!
I wonder if I'll be properly punished as a juvenile delinquent
Sure, right? But the amazing thing is that the newborn survived there for three days!
I really hope that kid gets adopted to a good place ㅠㅠ
Yes, I really hope you meet good parents and live happily!
Yeah, I really hope so too~
Did you know that there is a Korean photographer who goes to America and takes photos for free?
Oh, is that the one that takes pictures of people who participated in the Korean War?
Wow, you know
I was so touched when I saw that ㅜㅜ
Yeah, that's right. I think I saw it on Instagram recently~
I saw it on YouTube, does he have an Instagram account?
Yeah, I went in and saw that it was there, and the scenery photos were really nice!
Yeah, when people ask how much a frame costs, isn't it absolutely creepy what the photographer says?
It was really cool, I want to learn it too Kiki
Yeah, but when I was talking to someone about it, he said something even more touching.
Didn't you see that video?
What does that mean? Tell me too, Kiki
Didn't you say the photographer already paid you so you don't have to pay?
Oh, so that means it was because you helped our country in the past.
But he said that what we paid was not originally there, that free people have the right to enjoy freedom, and that we should do the same for countries that long for freedom!
He is truly a true person Kiki is awesome!
So let's follow in his footsteps and become like that person!
Yeah, I should go see that too.
You said you were getting rid of your freckles. Did you get the procedure done?
No, I'm still saving up money ㅠㅠ The estimate is better than I expected
How much does that cost?
It probably costs about 1 million won.
That's a lot of money, isn't it?
Wow, you only went to one place and got a quote?
No, I went to a few places but they were all similar ㅠㅠ
Then you can definitely make them all disappear?
Um, it's like 6 sessions for 1 million won?
If you do it 6 times, it will all disappear!
Well, I'm worried because my freckles are deep ㅠㅠ
I see. But I've always wanted to do it, so let's save up money quickly!
Yeah, I've collected about half of it now.
Didn't your sister say she was getting her nose done?
Yeah I'm so nervous I could die!
When did you say you were going to get your nose done?
I'm planning to do it in the winter!
Oh right, I'll do that in the winter too
Then, aren't there any nutritional supplements you're taking these days?
I'm thinking about buying some nutritional supplements these days. Can you give me some recommendations?
I've been going to the hospital lately, and they told me to make sure to take my vitamins!
Really? What vitamins? Multivitamins?
Just a multivitamin!
The teacher said that because the front seat changed, his body itself was very tired!
Kiki I still have a long way to go before I can change seats hehe
Hey, I'm in my mid-teens now, even by Korean standards.
Well, I'm so tired these days, I'll just eat...
Yeah, but I definitely feel less sleepy in the afternoon after eating it!
Oh, it worked, Kiki.
Where can I buy nutritional supplements?
I used to just buy things online, but I use Coupang a lot these days!
Is the price okay?
If it's too expensive, it's a burden
The food I eat is very cheap
Should I tell you the price?
Yeah, share it with me too, Kiki
Let me try it this time~
Ah, I still have a long way to go before I can buy it, so I'll give mine away~
Yeah, I'll try it first and then buy it together
Where are you going to buy your fall clothes this time?
I'm thinking about an internet shopping mall Kiki
Hey, which shopping mall do you use?
I mostly like Ableena Zigzag
Of course, it's the shopping mall that people in their 20s love the most. It's Kiki.
Oh, you know that too, sis~ Isn't it okay?
Yes, I often use it because it gathers many shopping malls into one place~
Oh right, they sell pretty clothes cheap there too~
Yeah but the kids are so skinny it's hard to choose a size ㅜㅜ
So I always check the details before buying.
Oh, I see that too, but it's hard to buy because the sizes are different for each piece of clothing.
Then it would be better to just buy the top and buy the bottom offline.
That's true, but I'm just living a hit or miss life~
Yeah, it's cheap, so Kiki is good.
Yeah, if it's long, it's better to wear it long than short. Kiki
Now that we're on the subject, I should go shopping too~
Are you watching You Quiz these days?
That's Yoo Jae-suk's thing, but I don't get to see it often ㅠㅠ
I'm watching it on YouTube too, and I heard Yoo Jae-suk appeared as an anchor this time!
Oh, are you interviewing Yoo Jae-suk?
No, Yoo Jae-seok hosted a live broadcast as an MBC anchor!
Wow, really? Kiki is amazing
Did Yoo Jae-suk get along well with the announcer?
No, I just read the article and then I'll watch the video later!
Wow, I should see it too~
I'm a huge fan of Yoo Jae-seok ㅠㅠ
Is there really anyone who hates Yoo Jae-suk?
Yeah, that's right too, Kiki
The nation's favorite MC~
That's right, but is it true that I'm already over 50 years old?
Oh really? I guess celebrities are different.
My dad is like my grandfather Kiki
Do you know that? God Yoo Jae-seok and I are the same age. Kiki
Wow, but you look so young, I thought you were in your mid-40s.
Right? You're the ultimate self-management expert!
Wow, that's cool.
I've been wanting to see you for a long time, Yoo Jae Suk!
What movie did you see last?
I saw Mogadishu at the drive-in theater~
Oh, where did the drive-in theater go?
It was nice that it was at the Sejong Intercity Bus Terminal.
Is Sejong a new place?
There it is, Sejong Special City between the princess and the war~
Oh, there's a new drive-in theater
I know that much, right?
Ah, I've been there for a long time, Kiki
Oh, I also go to drive-in theaters often, but I've never been to Sejong!
Where have you been?
Recommend me Kiki
I've been to Pyeongtaek, Yongsan, Daejeon, and Cheonan, and among them, I recommend Daejeon!
Wow, Daejeon isn't that far away?
My boyfriend is far away, except for me~
Ah~ What did you see at Kiki's War?
I think I saw that speech!
Malmoido is also fun Kiki
I like that too
Sisters~ What did you eat for lunch today?
I ate soft tofu and bibimbap today haha!
Kiki I had bone soup! The terrace was open there so the weather was nice and it was delicious. How about you?
I ate convenience store noodles. They were delicious, but I was hungry. ㅜㅜ
ㅠㅠ The bibimbap there was a lot and it was plentiful
Next time, you come with me!
Kiki, that's right, it was 1000 won different from mine, but the quantity was huge, I'll try it later too
I want to try it too~ I like soft tofu stew too!
Oh but I got a stomachache after eating that ㅠㅠ
I guess I shouldn't eat red food anymore ㅠ
Oh really? You were eating so deliciously earlier ㅠㅠ
But my sister said it tasted like ramen soup. Was it spicy?
I guess it was provocative ㅜㅜ
But my sister said her stomach hurt since this morning, so I guess it was because she wasn't feeling well...
Because I'm a punk ㅠㅠ You should eat carefully too, because you'll often have stomach aches later on
So you're hungry today, so you're going to eat a hamburger for dinner?
Kiki Woong, that's right ㅜㅜ
Are you really going to eat a hamburger because you're hungry? You can't.
But didn't you say it was okay to eat bread?
I'd rather eat something soft than a hamburger! Haha
No, let's just eat dead!
I have to go get an endoscopy ㅠㅠ
I really want to stop eating dead... Stop eating dead!
Kiki, I can really feel your sincerity
But I think I need to eat something too
My sister also had to keep going to the bathroom today ㅠㅠ
Seriously, why are you both always sick?
I'm jealous of your healthy ** sister~
The healthiest of us all, really Kiki
My stomach hurts, but I want to eat something delicious!
Until the exam, don't eat spicy food or drink coffee!
Be healthy like me!
That's right, be careful what you eat before the test~
Yeah, that's right. I don't even drink coffee much these days!
After exams, let's go eat chicken feet!
Does anyone have any interior design ideas they'd like to try?
I originally preferred white to make it look spacious, but these days I like a warmer feel haha
Kiki I originally had a wood family, but I changed it to white when I moved!
I'm also white now, but if I were to decorate it, I'd like to decorate it with a wood and rattan feel!
Oh, I know what you mean Kiki
I want to decorate with a bit of a vintage feel! Cozy messy... Kikki
You know what it is ^^?
Kiki Woong Woong I want to decorate them both with a similar feel
It must be pretty
Kiki, you know what comfortable messiness is?
If you dress up like that later, invite me~
I don't know when that will be... haha!
Have you guys ever used blackout curtains?
Wow, the blackout curtains are really big, sis
If you don't have it at home right now, I definitely recommend buying it!
Yeah but I don't think it's completely dark
It gets a little brighter in the morning, but it's not completely dark!
Isn't that a bit bright in color?
I used to wear it in real black, but it's completely blocked Kiki
I'm currently living without curtains and I'm debating whether or not to put them up!
Since there is no blind, I wake up early and I can't sleep much anyway.
It's a must-have. There are so many pretty blackout curtains these days. I definitely recommend them.
Ah, I guess it's because I'm not black ㅜㅜ
Aha, but if you block out the light, you'll end up sleeping without even realizing it? Kiki
If you keep Kiki closed, it won't be like that
Kiki, aren't you going to be late because you can't wake up in the morning?
But when you sleep, you close it... Kiki
I guess I'll just have to live without it...
Kiki Well, if you really block out the light, you can sleep without even knowing what time it is.
Kiki then let's go to a place with a moderate amount of darkness like me
Okay, I'll think about it!
There are a lot of pretty curtains these days.
There are a lot of pretty things right now
My room curtains are gold Kiki and white translucent?
Oh my room is also a combination of gold and white Kiki
No, is this a real gold story? Show me the picture later Kiki, I'm curious
Kiki, I'll show you when we eat!
Because it rained, there were more people on the subway~
That's right, when it rains there really are a lot of people ㅠㅠ
Aren't you guys taking the bus?
Yeah, I'm glad the bus comes all at once, but the Gangnam commuter bus is absolutely impossible. Sob sob
Do you all like buses or subways?
I hate buses! I hate subways because they smell ㅠㅠ
I'm on a bus! I like being able to see the scenery outside.
I think the subway is better
The bus was shaking so much that it was hard to stand~
That's right ㅠㅠ
But the bus has a higher chance of finding a seat and it runs on a dedicated road, so it feels a bit faster, haha.
But the subway is definitely faster and the timing is accurate.
The bus is great for going out and having fun!
That's right, the subway is perfect for getting to appointments on time!
I think the bus is good when you have free time
Oh actually I think I only rode the bus for a short time haha
Kiki stupid stupid nana
But do you ride the bus with a bus seat?
Yeah, I can't ride it on the way to work because it's too crowded, and I don't mind arriving late on the way home because it's crowded, so I just ride it!
Oh, but aren't seat buses expensive?
But can't you sit on the subway when you go home?
Yeah, the seat bus is so expensive ㅜㅜ
Yeah, I ride the subway to Jamsil for a bit, but I can hardly sit down~
We also go to Sadang with Kiki ** every day, and there are always lots of people no matter when we ride.
So when we first went there late, we expected there wouldn't be anyone there, but it was the same ^^
But don't you like that there aren't a lot of people before the 9 o'clock curfew?
Oh yeah, that's right. If you go around 8:30, there won't be many people, but since the holiday period is over, there have been a lot of people ㅠㅠ!
Yes, it was a hit or miss
I used to go sitting, but now I just go standing.
Kiki, it must be hard. I think it's a bit better for me than for my sister.
I think line 7 is always crowded. Line 2 is somewhat better.
**This guy dies on line 4 every day... Kiki
Kiki is right ㅠㅠ Buy a car and come pick me up
Is there a part-time job you want to try?
Part-time jobs... don't exist anymore... haha
But I wanted to go to Everland Kiki
Kiki Everland I want to try it too, it seems fun
But the department assignments there are completely random.
I want to go to an amusement park too!
I think it will be fun
Yeah! But I think you and Nana will suit each other well.
I can imagine you waving your hands while wearing a headband Kiki
Kiki, the randomness there is so random that even the cafe is random, so if you get caught at a restaurant, it's hell ㅠㅠ
I guess it's okay since there are no people these days
Kiki is right, wearing a headband and waving her hand Kiki
The restaurant is really a mess... If you get caught in a restaurant, you should just do it for a month and then leave it alone...
Oh restaurant...ㅠㅠ Now I'm so tired I can't do that...
I feel like it's been years since I've been to an amusement park ㅠㅠ
I want to go to Everland
Me tooㅜㅜ When I was in high school, I went to Lotte World once a year...
I was a little disappointed because it rained when I went to Lotte World before ㅠㅠ
I think I went to Everland when I was in elementary school.
Do you know any weird part-time jobs? Something unusual?
No, I can't think of anything in particular!
Do you have a sister?
But there weren't any particularly special part-time jobs in the provinces, Kiki
Aren't there many things like that in Seoul?
I don't really know because I haven't done it myself, but looking at the Walkman, it seems like there are a lot of jobs!
I saw you making candy a while ago Kiki
Oh, what kind of candy? I also watch Walkman YouTube sometimes when it comes up~
Oh, is that a candy factory? Kiki
I don't think I've ever seen a Walkman
I saw it a while ago when it came up, and Kiki was making Ryan candy by hand.
It was amazing, but it looked difficult
Oh, that's the candy that comes in the shape of a character, right?
I saw that being made in Malaysia before. It's amazing.
Wow I want Ryan candy Kiki
Is that Kim Sunggyu?
Is he experiencing part-time work?
Wow, how did you see that in person? It's amazing Kiki
Was your name Kim Sung-gyu?
Kiki, no, it seemed natural for a moment so I didn't know, but aren't you Jang Sung-kyu?
I don't know, it looks like Kiki Jang Sung-kyu!
Kiki Kim Sunggyu, so it was a new moment
Is there anyone around you whose boyfriend is a career soldier?
Kiki isn't among my close friends, but I think she was among my club seniors
My friend's older brother is a career soldier!
But you said you were quitting?
Oh really? Why did you quit?
Oh but professional soldiers are cool haha
Didn't it fit well?
First of all, I can't come home often and I can't go out even more because of the coronavirus, so is this considered graduation?
He said he wouldn't do that anymore ㅠㅠ
But I asked why my boyfriend is a career soldier because he said it's hard to meet him ㅜㅜ
When I go out for an overnight stay, I can't leave the area, so I have to go there...
Oh really? ㅠㅠ This is crazy... It's torture, but just like that?
Oh, by the way, my friend was also a career soldier, but it seems like he quit when I checked his Instagram... I guess I should ask him if that was the reason.
Yeah, that's right. I also have girlfriend issues ㅠㅠ
That's why I think it would be hard for me if my boyfriend was a career soldier...
Yeah, it's hard just waiting for the military, but if your job is a soldier... I don't think I'll ever meet you...
But wouldn't it be okay to meet up when there wasn't corona?
Maybe we can meet every weekend? I don't know about that.
But due to the nature of the job, it's probably harder to meet someone with that profession than with other professions ㅜㅜ
It would be nice if we could see each other every weekend, but it would be difficult in the current situation ㅠㅠ
My boyfriend's friend also passed the military service exam this time, but I thought of my girlfriend first ㅠㅠ
What should I do if I get posted far away?
Right ㅜㅜ Is that random across all regions?
Did you have a good talk with your girlfriend...? ㅠㅠ
One of my married friends has a husband who is in the military, and they live apart from each other and raise the child, so it seems really hard. He raises the child almost alone.
Wow, really? But if you get married, won't you move into a house nearby and live together?
That's right, it's the same in the military, and even if your husband is an athlete, you can't see him for weeks when he goes to training.
I don't want to get married to someone with that kind of job ㅜㅜ
That guy had work to do, so he did that, but now he's in that military housing? Well, he moved in and lives with me. He actually moved in not too long ago...
Oh, that's a relief
If your job is in the military or if it's that far away, it seems like one side has to match ㅠㅠ
Yeah, I know how to date, but I can't think about marriage ㅜㅜ
I really don't think I can do it even if I have to give up my work ㅠㅠ
I would acknowledge someone like Park Ji-Sung! Kiki!
Kiki, that's right, let's think about that later
Anyone who tried Kumon when they were young~
Me~ I tried talent education and Kumon haha
Kiki, Kiki, I really didn't want to solve that, so I tore the paper and threw it away secretly... Sorry, Mom.
Kiki, I did that on the bus and on the street because I was pushed... Kiki
Wow you are amazing Kiki
I can't do that...
I didn't want to open the door because it seemed like I barely did my homework before the teacher came.
Kiki and Kitan math? You know that? I think I did that a lot, got scolded and cried ㅠㅠ
I did it because I was scared of getting in trouble...
I also did the math trick, I liked it, Kiki
It's been a really long time since I've heard this name
Oh... I don't know Kiki
But after I grew up a bit and started cleaning up the house, I found a lot of workbooks thrown away behind the bookshelf...
It was a collaboration between the three siblings. I guess they hid Kiki.
Kiki, there are so many books in so many different colors ㅠㅠ
But I think I'll do it later when I have a baby haha
Kiki-chan, a collaboration between the three Kiki siblings, is hilarious
Hey, is there still math in the kitan?
Kiki **I think she'll be really strict with her baby
Kiki, originally, such series would continue to come out
Going into teacher tiger mode!
Kiki ** Have a baby like your sister! Raising a baby is also a great baby Kiki
Ah Kiki, really... No, but there are kids who won't open the door if you do things like worksheets...
I've experienced that, Kiki, during lessons
Kiki, aren't you being treated rudely?
I can relate to the baby, but I think the older sister will be really pissed off.
Kiki, no, this is the first time I've heard that, it's funny Kiki
How much do you hate me that you won't open it Kiki
Sigh... It depends on whether you practice or not Kiki
It was really ridiculous, it was always war, war, really
Kiki: But usually, babies aren't alone, but with their mothers, right?
Right, how old are you? You're probably with your mom.
I was 7 when I first did it, but after I got a little older, I didn't do it often Kiki
Because the baby and I were close and we lived in the same building...
So on days when my mother isn't around, I call out the password and don't open the door from the inside, causing chaos ^^
Kiki is really just like an elementary school student, but really, uh, Kiki
Oh, but I also want to learn piano again
Kiki's password is really cute
I want to learn piano again. It's cool if you play it well.
I'll teach you guys Kiki!
Kiki is known as cool. Do you want to learn? Do you want to learn?
Do you spend a lot of time with your family?
Before coming up to Seoul, I tried to spend as much time with you as possible haha
It was my first time living with my family as an adult!
I don't really do anything outside very often, and when I do eat out, it's usually with the whole family. Kiki
Chuseok is coming soon
Oh, you lived in a dorm in college?
Yeah, I live in a dorm and I'm still living alone!
Back then, I didn't go down to my parents' house very often except for holidays... haha
So this Chuseok, it's been a while since we last saw each other?
That's right. When I was young, we traveled together a lot, but now we eat out together every weekend!
But these days, because of Corona, I've been eating at home all the time ㅜㅜ
Ah, Kiki, don't come down this Chuseok! It's so strange...
Even when we lived together, I don't think we went out to eat every week.
My family likes to stay at home, so we don't eat out much.
You don't want me to come during Chuseok because of Corona? Really?
We always do this for lunch on weekends
It's a shame I can't do it these days because of Corona...
Yeah, because of Corona... Don't ride the bus!
But in my house, we like eating at home more than eating out, Kiki
It seems like you tend to bring it home to eat?
Kiki, my mom and dad are both busy at home, so I don't move from the sofa on the weekends. I'm stuck.
Kiki, you both work on weekdays, right?
Kiki, that's my story...
I'm stuck too. I hate leaving the house.
Kiki, ugh, and my house is close to my house, so my aunts used to just come over to my house and play.
Kiki, that's amazing. I like the bed fixed the best too...
It's also fun to eat together every week!
In Jinju, it seems like they were busy going out because they had plans on the weekend.
Kiki, that's right. I also go out a lot on weekends, so I think I see you guys more.
But when we have plans, one of us has to drop out. Kiki
That's right, the people I see the most these days are my sisters
I see Jinjjang Kiki more often than my older sister who lives with me!
Kiki, you really are the one who eats with me the most
Kiki That's right, I eat the most with my sisters
Still, I'm glad you guys are here ^^ Kiki
Kiki, that's what you got here!
Does everyone have an ideal type? What is your ideal type?
I guess I don't really care about external things anymore?!
I wish I was someone who worked a little harder Kiki I hate lazy people
Kiki, right, your personalities have to match well
Externally, I am a person who likes clothes to fit well!
I'm a very manly person with a good sense of humor!
I like good physique haha
But even if you don't look at the outside, honestly, I don't think you can completely ignore it Kiki
I also like things that are a bit more manly when it comes to appearances!
Kiki But even if you leave out the external factors, if your personality doesn't match, then bye
A truly good man is the best. Let's meet a good man.
Yeah, he's nice, but isn't there anyone fun to be had? Kiki
Your ideal type is just your ideal type Kiki
If you meet your ideal type, your personality won't match and it's difficult ^^
Kiki, why are you satisfied with your boyfriend now? Just accept it.
Kiki, of course you're satisfied with your boyfriend now~
No, I never said I was dissatisfied!
I like it now Kiki
How long have you two been dating?
That's right, that's right, I'm 493 today!
I came to see you because I couldn't remember Kiki, I'm 489 days old!
Kiki Oh both but it feels like it's older
Kiki I saw it too Kiki
It's hard to remember at this point
Yeah, I think I'm older too, but not as much as I thought
I don't feel that way because I just don't meet her... Kiki
Sister, you came to Korea not long after you started dating?
Didn't you say you dated for two months? Isn't that right Kiki?
Two months? No, Kiki. About half a year?
**How long has it been!
Kiki, it's been 400 days since I applied for the exam!
Sister, let's all go to Australia together in the winter, our Delko hehe
Oh, it hasn't been two months Kiki
That's right, sis, it was 400 days back then. Let's go to Australia, let's go!
Kiki, I like you! Let's go when the border is released!
Instead of just taking pictures of the scenery, let's go take it in with our eyes!
Do you know Kang Hyung-wook?
I've watched several programs featuring Kang Hyung-wook, and it's really amazing to see how the dogs' behavior is corrected!
I know Kang Hyung-wook!
I think that guy is a real puppy Kiki
How do you know so well?
Yes, dogs need training sometimes too.
I saw a really big dog owner correct a really big biting dog.
Kiki that guy is a dog so funny Kiki
Yeah, I also find that pro funny and watch it sometimes, but when dogs do that, it's always the owner's fault ㅜㅜ
We need to educate them well
Yeah, but it seems really difficult because even the owners can't know everything ㅠㅠ
Last time, I saw a program where a dog didn't sleep well, so they thought it was insomnia and spent a lot of money to take it to the hospital, but when the dog didn't sleep, the owner came and played with it, so they pretended not to be able to sleep. Kiki
Kiki, really? You want me to play with you? You're so cute ㅠㅠ
Kiki is so cute
I told you that puppies are really smart
So, is there an episode you remember from the program that Kang Hyung-wook appears in? Kiki
I don't know because I don't watch Kang Hyung-wook's stuff much
I guess you've never seen anything like the story above?
I've seen a lot, but I don't remember anything.
It seems like I've only seen stories about dogs that bark!
Kiki, what do you think about raising reptiles?
Kiki I'm a reptile not my style
My older sister is so far away from me, do you want to raise her?
I hate reptiles too... most of them are kind of gross ㅜㅜ
I can't raise Kiki either because she's annoying
But there are actually quite a few people who like reptiles.
Yeah, when I was little, whenever I went to the aquarium, they always put a snake around my neck. Ugh, I still hate it.
I told Kiki, when I went to Thailand, I had a snake around my neck!
Kiki, I'm also in Japan...
But if you go to the aquarium, are there snakes too?
Was it a Molang zoo?
It's a national rule that each person must hang out in a cave or something like that. Kiki
Kiki zoo is right, I don't know what aquarium means~ Kiki
No, Kiki, I will never miss it!
**Oh, I was just genuinely curious ^^
Kiki-chan is funny no
But you're all used to it now, right?
Kiki is right, it's just funny and entertaining
But I can't stand teasing~ Kiki
Too much Kiki Now if you pretend, it's pretend, really!
Kiki, let's go see snakes together! Bam Bam Bam
Anyone who has ever been there~
I don't have any ㅠㅠ
Have you been there all?
In summer it's a paradise, in winter it's a ski resort!
Sister, aren't you good at riding these rides?
Sister, but I'm curious. Are there any places in the provinces that do something like that?
Don't know if you're in the province? Let's look it up later haha
I'm really good at rides!
Don't forget to go to the local area. There were a lot of swimming pools, like Ocean World.
Oh, ** Sister, are you good at that kind of thing? Like amusement rides or water sports?
Yeah, there are a lot of those!
**How do you not know this well haha
I think it was like that when I was looking into where to go, Kiki
I want to say I'm really good at riding, but I recently got blown away on a hot air balloon ride, so I'll just say I can ride it ^^
Kiki, I also rode with my hands tightly clenched so that I wouldn't fly away...
It won't work. Let's go together next time. I have to let you experience it ^^
Oh Kiki but I can handle that well
Kiki, you have to choose the place well
If you go somewhere fun, give us a long ride and then just blow us away, Kiki
I like Kiki so I have to search hard before I go~
Now that I mention it, I really want to go after a long time ㅜㅜ
Did you all go to Gapyeong?
Yeah, I'm all Gapyeong! But I heard there's one in the Han River too?
Me too, Gapyeong! I haven't heard of any other places, but I heard there's one in the Han River too?
Oh really? I'm hearing this for the first time too! **Kiki, let me know
I'll go later
Yeah, but my friends said it wasn't that great
Let's go to Gapyeong
Oh, but you have to go to a famous place
The original is the best, let's go to Gapyeong
Gapyeong is the original? Okay haha that sounds fun
I have to go to the amusement park later.
Kiki, we have so much to do, our schedule is jam-packed with cars
Kiki, that's right, we all have to do it
I can't do it because of corona ㅜㅜ
Kiki, you won't have to worry about what to do later.
Kiki, I'm already so excited, let's go, let's go
Have you ever played online games when you were young?
I really liked Tales Runner, has anyone tried it?
I've heard of Tales Runner, but what game is it? I haven't played it.
Kiki Hul Terran why don't you know it was so fun Kiki
You know what? If you can't break that hard block, you'll be in a terrible map.
Kiki Terran doesn't know~ There's a generation gap!
It's a game where you run as a character~
Yeah I think that block is hard Kiki
Kiki, this is so ridiculous, really Kiki
Tell me a game you know quickly.
Kiki ellele ellele~ Unnie, what games did you play when you were young?
Since you don't know Kiki, let's just keep talking about games you don't know~
You guys are really elementary school kids, elementary school kids~ I can't play with you, really! Kiki
No, I played the running game R2V2... Is this also a generation gap...
I've only heard of Kiki R2B2 but never actually done it. I did O2Jam!
I've heard of it all, but honestly I've never done it
Have you tried all the crazy arcades? Haha
Of course, of course, unconditionally~
I did that a bit even after I went to college, Kiki
Kiki, have you all played Maple Story?
I did it when I was in college too Kiki
It's still fun to do that with friends
Maple Story is famous so I tried it but it wasn't fun so I didn't try it Kiki
I liked maple story
But when I wasn't playing for a while, I got hacked and all my items were stolen ^^... I'm getting mad when I think about it again.
Oh really? Turns out it wasn't my older brother who did it.
It's so funny how you got caught
Kiki: So how exactly did you get hacked?
I don't know Kiki, I'm also curious, but all the good items I had were gone and my character was naked...
Kiki oh my I can't play Maple for long
It's fun to complete quests, but I'm sick of them all being the same
Kiki was funny because she was taking off her clothes Kiki
Yeah, I'm sick of it. There used to be something called Husky Express, and it was fun, but don't you know this? It wasn't that famous.
Why did you play so many games, Kiki?
I really know what's going on
I've never heard of that before. What game is it?
It was fun having a husky pull me around on a sled and doing quests Kiki
I've played a lot of different games
There was a game called Hammer on Yahoo, never played it?
Haha I don't even know how to play hammer game...
I played Grand Chase a lot when I was young.
Kiki I don't know if there's a game like that these days
Ah, right now is the perfect weather to go on a trip. It's neither too hot nor too cold. I want to go on a trip!
Seriously ㅠㅠ At this time, I'm on vacation and thinking about traveling...
I was planning to go out and play with my friends this time, but the coronavirus is so bad that I can't go.
Heoryu ㅠ I might go on a trip with my friends for 1 night and 2 days in October. Is there a place you would recommend?
So because of Corona...
** Are you planning to go out and play with your friend?
That's right ㅠㅠ There are 4 of us, but we all live in different areas so it won't be easy to meet up.
Yeah, I think we'll go together, but I haven't been able to do anything because I'm studying for exams these days. Kiki, take a walk.
Kiki **, do you have friends who live in Seoul?
** Sister, Gyeongju is also pretty these days
I'm telling you because I want to go. It's like Gangneung, but there's a sea there.
Carrots Carrots There are more in Seoul than in Jinju now Kiki
Yeah, it's a good place to go on a trip to Gyeongju, but really ㅠㅠ
But it's a bit far from Seoul so it might be a bit like that
So, I'd like to rent a car and drive it myself, but I'm not at that stage yet, so I need to look for a place with convenient transportation.
It's still a long way to go by train
Busan is okay if you take the train, but I went to Gangneung by bus and walking.
Kiki is right, and it's hard to get around Gyeongju without a car!
I haven't been to Gangneung, but I want to go.
I've never been to Sokcho without taking a car.
Are you okay with walking?
It's inconvenient to go anywhere with a backpackㅜㅜ
I think I took a taxi in Gangneung ㅜㅜ
But Busan has good transportation so it was okay to walk!
**You too, go to Busan**Like this! Haha
Well, Busan has a subway and I've been there by foot, but it's too far ㅠㅠ
Anyone who has been to Taean and wants to try a new place?
I see, I haven't been to Taean ㅜㅜ
Is there anything famous in Taean?
I guess you've never looked for it before haha
No, I heard that a lot of people go to Taean around Gunyang? Has anyone been to Jeonju, Kiki?
Oh, I've been to Jeonju! I've been there twice~
Me too haha I went to Naeilro once and just went once
There are a lot of delicious things in Jeonju, I like it
Oh really? I guess I've never been to Jeonju properly?
Is it okay to walk with a backpack?
Yeah, it's been so long that I don't remember, but I think it was okay!
It's worth a visit! If you go to Jeonju, you must try the bibimbap croquette...
Kiki Oki I need to make a proper plan after the exam is over
It's getting chilly in the evenings these days. I'll be wearing long sleeves soon!
It was a bit chilly in the morning when I woke up ㅠㅠ
Right? That's why I wore long sleeves last time, but it was still hot for me in long sleeves?
Yeah, it's still hot during the day so I'd rather wear long sleeves
Otherwise, I guess I'll just have to wear long sleeves in the morning and evening!
That's also true Kiki
But when it's hot, it's cold inside the office because of the air conditioning...
Kiki, and first of all, you can never wear long sleeves on the subway, phew
Yeah, but it's better than being hot
** Sister, why is it hot in the subway?
But since I was home on the weekend, it was a bit hot when I practiced Kiki
That's why I turned on the air conditioner...
It was very muggy.
Yeah, the subway is packed with people, so I'm going to go
No, the weather was really fantastic this weekend.
It's neither hot nor cold, it's cool itself!
Yeah, but I think it was a bit hot at home over the weekend
The air was fine, but it felt humid Kiki
Kiki, it's going to be cold again soon
Do you like winter or summer?
That's right, the daily temperature difference will become very large soon, so it'll be very cold at night ㅜㅜ
I used to like summer, but now I think I like winter better ㅜㅜ
I... hate both of them now haha
Couldn't it be appropriate? ㅠㅠ
I hate winter because the clothes are too dull, and I hate summer because they're too sticky...
I'm not sure about this year, but it doesn't seem as cold as I thought it would be this winter.
Is it because I don't go out much?
No, I don't like either of them, but I chose them anyway ㅜㅜ
Yeah, I think it was a little less cold last year!
I didn't know because I hardly went out last year. Even if Kiki goes out, is it just for a little while?
How about this year...
But I still want to see the snow!
Kiki, that's right, it definitely feels like winter when it snows
It was so pretty when I came last year!
Yeah, it's gritty and I hate it when it melts, but when I first got it, it was really pretty!
I haven't seen it come down so often!
Kiki, but it's nice to see the snow falling, but the commute to work is hell...
That's right, when it snows it's worse than when it rains, and the car can't even move forward...
When I was in high school, there was a day when it snowed a lot, so the bus couldn't go forward, so we all arrived an hour late.
I took it for granted at school too
No, Kiki, this is beyond imagination
It's never been like that before ㅠㅠ This is crazy...
Kiki, I think I saw an article last year that said it snowed so much that people were all tied up in the streets.
Have you seen the 26-year-old woman who got hired at a large corporation get beaten to death by her boyfriend?
Oh my gosh I saw that and it really pissed me off
That reason is even more ridiculous
Oh, why? I don't see you much these days, so I don't know what's going on.
Yeah, the reason is even more ridiculous
That CCTV has been released, so take a look ** Sister
But the woman followed him first and hit him on the head.
If I had just sent it, he wouldn't have died, but that was a bit much ㅜㅜ
Oh really? The man beat the woman to death?
But that guy must have studied for some safety-related certification or something, so he must have been fully aware of the Golden Time, but he kept saying it was a bit strange that he didn't report it.
What's the reason! The man beat the woman to death because she hit his head first while they were fighting?
I think those two were in the same training center, but when the guy asked to have a secret relationship, I think the girl told one of her classmates.
So we fought, but it turned out that he was flirting with other women from the same training center, and he contacted them like he was flirting.
That's why we fought because I told you we were lovers
Oh yeah, that guy is really crazy...
But they said that it might not be punishable as murder because it wasn't intentional.
Wow... Men are just trash from the beginning. Are they crazy? I really hate them...
And if someone dies, what is it if not murder? Wow... Really?
This is really ridiculous
But if you look at the fact that he didn't report it right away and dragged her into the elevator and stuff, it's because he didn't report it right away that he caused more deaths ㅜㅜ
I just looked it up again and he said he texted that other girl and said she was special to him and that he was sexually attracted to her.
No, but I think you would know better than anyone else about golden time and such...
The very idea of beating a person to death is horrifying...
But it seems like news like this comes out every year
Even I was at the airport trying to get home from Thailand and I saw two Chinese men and women fighting and hitting each other... Phew ㅠㅠ
Yeah... dating violence happens a lot.
If you touch it even a little bit at first, you have to break up right away.
It was getting more and more intense
That's right, but in most cases, people who continue to date while being physically abused are actually gaslighters.
In the old days, I was shocked when I saw a video of a man beating a woman in an underground shopping mall in Busan.
It really seems to be the same as last time
Yeah, it's gaslighting... I don't understand why you keep dating even after getting hit ㅜㅜ
Yeah, I think I saw that video too
Dating violence is very common these days, so we need to establish proper laws.
ㅠㅠ That's right, when these kinds of problems arise, gender conflict also arises a lot...
Even though it has become a social issue, the same problems keep occurring, and it's because there are too many slapped-on punishments.
But if he's your boyfriend, you love him...
It's a really sad reality. How can you be beaten to death by your boyfriend and go crazy?
Yes, they should be punished properly.
They don't even punish me properly ㅜㅜ
So how miserable would it be for someone I love to die...
I think you might not have noticed because I treated you so well while we were dating...
How could I know in advance that my boyfriend would be that kind of person... ㅠㅠ
That's true, but I'm sure there were clear signs, seriously ㅠㅠ
Yeah, usually it starts with a quick hit, but it gets worse and worse. You have to get out of it.
There was also a case where a man killed his ex-girlfriend's entire family.
Seeing that, my mom and dad were worried and told me to find a good man ㅜㅜ
There are so many crazy people...
If I see something like that, I really can't meet anyone ㅠㅠ
I have to watch the video. It's scary but I'm curious.
Did you see that foreign substances were found in the Japanese Moderna vaccine?
Oh my god, I didn't see that ㅠㅠ
What's that black stuff in the vaccine? I heard it came out, but it looks like they're still checking?
But fortunately, it seems like it has nothing to do with our country?
Huh, how does it matter?
Still, that's a good thing...
They say that Japan is also doing cross-vaccination like our country!
I'm worried that I'll get the first AstraZeneca vaccine and then the second one will be Moderna or Pfizer ㅠㅠ
So even if it's random, you might not know it and get it right ㅠㅠ I'm anxious
Which country made that?
Anyway, I don't remember, but they said that the foreign substance was found only there, but the ones that came into our country were made in the US, so it shouldn't be a problem!
Hmm really? ㅠㅠ We're about to get the vaccine too, but even just one news like that makes me a little scared
When are you all getting vaccinated?
I'm coming in September!
Did you guys see the story about someone getting leukemia after getting Pfizer? That's what scared me.
Me too, September! It's the weekend before Chuseok ㅠㅠ
But isn't leukemia really scary? And in our country too...?
Wow, how is that? There are so many variables ㅠㅠ
They say that women in their 20s often experience side effects from myocarditis.
Yeah, our country ㅜㅜ The groom-to-be has leukemia, and the bride-to-be posted this
Yes, they said not to exercise after getting the vaccine because of myocarditis and stuff.
My boyfriend also got hit and told me about the side effects related to his heart.
No... how do you get compensated for that, seriously ㅠㅠ
But isn't this person someone who originally had an illness?
It's so scary. A healthy person suddenly gets leukemia... I think the bride-to-be will be really sad.
But I haven't seen any side effects around me yet, so I'm hoping it works out well...!
Yeah, I thought he was originally healthy, working out and not drinking or smoking ㅜㅜ
I think it's acute leukemia.
I haven't seen anyone around me suffer from severe side effects yet.
The odds are slim, but I'm still scared that it might be me.
It's true! ㅠㅠ Two people around me went to the emergency room because they had a really high fever and were in a lot of pain.
Wow, both of them are already sick, so I'm worried.
That's right, during Astra, I saw people around me with high fevers and going to the emergency room!
But I don't think I've seen Pfizer or Moderna
So let's get vaccinated and hope we're all fine...
Oh my...ㅠㅠ But I heard that no one had a strange reaction to the foreign substance that came out in Japan?
Whew Whew, luckily no one was hit by the foreign substance!
My mom also got AstraZeneca, but she was really sick ㅠㅠ
Oh thank goodness I guess I saw the foreign object before I got hit~
That AstraZeneca made a lot of people suffer ㅜㅜ
My mom and dad got through it okay, so that was a relief.
Yeah, my dad got Moderna and it was fine, but my mom got it the first time
But we have Pfizer or Moderna ㅠㅠ!
Is there a hairstyle you want to try? Whether it's dyeing, perming, or something else!
I want to try ombre haha
I have a layered cut! When you say ombre, you mean hair that has colored bridges here and there?
Yeah, that's right, right?
My friend used to be pretty~
Yeah, that's right!
I really want to try platinum blonde hair Kiki
But I bleached my hair before, and since my face is pale, bright colors don't really look good.
Kiki I also wanted to do ombre, but I didn't do it because they said I had to bleach my hair.
I've never bleached my hair
I also want to bleach my hair and make it platinum blonde and ash-colored, but the hair salon won't do it...ㅜㅜ My hair is too thin ㅜㅜ
Hmm ㅠㅠ I just used the medicine I always used at the beauty salon. Kiki
Let's try a layered cut!
But my friend has the same thin hair as me, and her hair looks really messed up, so I wonder if mine will be okay...?
Sister, our thin hair already looks thinner, and if you get a layered cut, it will look even thinner, so it's a disaster Kiki
Oh, I see ㅠㅠ
Oh, but I used a new sunscreen today, and it said it was for tone-up, but it got all over my mask and it looks like foundation.
I feel so annoyed and itchy
Sister, what sunscreen did you buy? Please recommend one.
I always use sunscreen that is colorless and fluffy... I never use sunscreen that leaves a white residue!
Sister, I need to buy a new one ㅜㅜ
I'm going to sleep! It's so moist here, Kiki
It's not stuffy or uncomfortable, but I was like, &quot;Oh?&quot; when I saw it on the mask.
Wow, but it's weird that sunscreen gets on the mask
Is it a powder formulation?
I originally just used white, but at some point, it started to get on my cheeks like powder.
So I changed it to Sunfact!
I think it's because the sunscreen color is like that ㅜㅜ
Isn't it because it's dry that it becomes like powder?
Is it okay if I change it to Sunfact?
I guess that's why haha
But it's still moist so it's good...
** How about the sun pack you recommended back then?
If it's okay, keep using it haha
Oh, that's right. I'm still using that Psynic sun pack, and honestly, it does make my skin softer, but I don't really know what it does for sun protection.
It's definitely nice that there are no quirks!
Kiki Oh, if you like it, that's good
Are you tapping it with the sponge that comes with it like a fact?
It's exactly the same as the fact, but the contents are sunscreen Kiki!
But since everyone's skin type is different, it's hard to recommend?
Yeah, but I definitely don't get oily after using this, and it's fine in the summer, but I'm worried it might dry out in the winter.
By the way, I've been using the same sunscreen for years now.
Kiki, you are so like that
Yeah, I also changed my sunscreen to a moist one for winter haha
Kiki I went to Olleung yesterday and they had a sunscreen like Selfusion C Pa-de.
I was a bit surprised to see that, it's a completely faded color
Everyone, please make sure to get a health checkup ㅜㅜ
Hey, looking at you makes me feel like I really have to try it Kiki
Kiki, that's why I also knew that it comes out every two years because of you guys
I honestly didn't know
Kiki, you said you never got that mail?
But come to think of it, **ah, your mother is a nurse. Don't you listen to her nagging?
Yeah, no!
And when I took the employment physical a long time ago, my mom took an X-ray and a blood test, so I think that's why?
Oh, has your mom ever done a blood test?
Oh good haha
I have a lot to do after the exams are over
First of all, you have to go to the dentist.
Yeah, go to the hospital and do it
My mom gave me the corona shot too Kiki
Oh really? It's great that Kiki's mom is a nurse!
Wow, that's so good, really? Kiki is trustworthy
Right, sister, you really need to see a dentist urgently.
Are you still sick?
Are you still sick these days?
I really have to go as soon as the exam is over!
Oww it hurts... It hurts when I brush my teeth...
I want to go quickly, but I can't go because I'm afraid I'll have to go before the exam and get treatment for my illness.
That's right ㅠㅠ Just hold on for 2 weeks...
Or would it be okay to just get the examination and then schedule a treatment appointment afterwards?
ㅜㅜ If there was a month left I would tell them to go, but since there are only two weeks left, I feel a bit hesitant...
Yeah, I might not be able to get treatment even if I get treatment anyway... I'll overcome it! Kiki
Do you guys get regular checkups?
I'm seriously thinking about getting dental insurance.
Yeah, I definitely got braces, so I go to the dentist regularly every month, and Kiki even does scaling there!
I also get a regular checkup once a year~
This is really important so you should get regular checkups ㅜㅜ
That's right ㅠㅠ Especially, I have to brush my teeth more often because I tend to get cavities even though I brush them well.
** Do you still use it after the water pick correction? Haha
No, I thought I had a new nozzle so I threw it away to use it, but I couldn't find the new nozzle so it's just sitting there now... ㅠㅠ
I'm just going to buy the nozzle from WeMakePrice!
But you don't have to correct that!
You shoot that with water to clean it, right?
I have it at home but no one uses it
Oh really? Kiki, I wanted to buy it because I was lazy, but is that too lazy?
No, but you have to do that while brushing your teeth.
That just won't do!
But it really feels like I brushed my teeth properly, it's so refreshing
** Sister, did you buy a new laptop this time?
That's right, what do you think when you try it ** Kiki!
Wow, I'm glad I changed it! It's so fast and good!
But surprisingly, Kiki has never taken it outside yet.
There's not much reason to take Kiki out!
Kiki, are you using the gifts you received back then?
Kiki, I always bring hand sanitizer too.
I bought a stamp too, but I haven't used it yet Kiki
I already have more than enough kitchen towels and detergent bowls!
Kiki is so funny, you gave me so many gifts
Where did you buy your laptop?
Kiki, this was truly a gift, truly the best ever
I bet you felt good
I bought an LG Gram Kiki
Oh seriously, this is my first time receiving a gift like that
Kiki, that and it's super light!
If you're satisfied, you made a good purchase~
Did you buy that at the LG in your neighborhood? Kiki
I want to buy a light laptop too!
Kiki Woong Woong Our neighborhood LG Best Shop!
No, but it was definitely good because it was light and fast.
At first I was worried about buying the one with the keypad on the side, but I think I made a good decision buying the one without it!
Ah, I don't know if the keypad is there or not Kiki
Let's go to ** sister's neighborhood to buy our electronics! Kiki to get a gift
No I mean Kiki
** You used to use Samsung, but now you use LG. Isn't the screen not bright?
Samsung laptop has yellowish screen
Oh, I didn't know, but Samsung's one feels a bit more yellow? The current one feels completely bright. Kiki
Where are you two using your laptop?
Kiki I have a Samsung laptop right now, so I can't compare, so I don't know about the yellowing. I think I'll have to change it to find out. Kiki
I used to use Samsung, but now I use LG!
Honestly, LG is the best when it comes to electronics.
Kiki is right LG is okay
No, but it's expensive for a laptop, maybe because it's been so long since I bought one
It's just a desktop price
How much did you pay for your laptop?
I think I bought the Samsung I'm using now for 200 or so
Idiot the original laptop is more expensive! Kiki
Desktops are much more powerful and cheaper!
But I guess I'll accept it and buy it because it's portable...
Oh really? I thought the laptop was originally cheaper?
I give 150 and get a three-month flex~
Kiki Wow I didn't know desktops were cheaper Kiki
Oh, the lighter the laptop, the more expensive it is and the less powerful it is. ㅠㅠ
I was looking for a laptop and a desktop before and I found out about Kiki.
Kiki, I solved the laptop problem, so now I'm going to go home and set up a PC in a PC room!
Is there a drama you enjoyed watching?
There are so many fun things~
The first thing that comes to mind right now is people who have seen Goblin ㅠㅠ!
Goblin is really fun
First of all, your face is so funny it's crazy
I watched it for a while because it was so fun, but then I stopped watching because it was boring and not fun ㅜㅜ
Why is everyone having fun but me...
No, how is that boring? First of all, Lee Dong Wook is in it...
I don't think I could watch it again if I was told to, but when I watched it, it was a huge hit and all the Kiki songs were popular.
Kiki, the content is important to me!
I guess I like something a little comical, or maybe something like Signal
Signal was really fun too!
But I watched the first episode alone and it was a little scary
Kiki, that's right, Signal was really famous too.
But I don't see Kiki
I thought of something comical, do you know Eurachacha Waikiki?
Kiki, I know what it is, but I haven't seen it. Is it fun?
I haven't seen it either!
I'm looking for a drama to binge watch after exams
Kiki no that's totally for killing time Kiki
I saw this a lot when I was walking on the subway. It's so funny.
Oh, I recently watched Iron Queen and enjoyed it, but there was a lot of talk about it distorting history ㅜㅜ
But the content is really fun!
I've heard of Iron Queen, but what is this?
There was a lot of talk about the historical drama that Blackpink's Jisoo is starring in this time.
Isn't Iron Queen a really old drama?
I don't think there's any other historical drama I've watched to the end other than Haepumdal.
No, it came out recently ㅜㅜ The current man enters the body of a former queen and it's so funny Kiki
It's not a serious historical drama, it's just a comedy
Oh, I know what that is!
I saw a summary of that on YouTube. Kiki was fun.
You're a really good actress, girl
Oh really? I can watch Kiki later. I have to watch it.
Who is this guy that's been creepy lately?
Shin Hye-sun! Is that your name Kiki?
I saw the movie Innocence and it was really funny because the serious and comedic acting was all good
That's right, that's right, Shin Hye Sun Kiki
It was also in Secret Forest. Did you guys see it?
Kiki Anning ㅠㅠ I haven't watched any dramas or movies lately
I haven't seen Secret Forest either
The name is so profound, I think it will be a serious drama.
Don't you know the rainforest?
This one's been out for a while now, season 1 is seriously awesome! Please definitely watch it...
Really? Okay, that'll be fun! Wow
Was there a cartoon you liked when you were young?
Oh, this is a bit much too?
You guys, do you know Attamamma? Kiki
I know, but I haven't seen Attama Mom properly Kiki
You guys know Dada? Should I say baby and animal? That's what comes out
I saw Atta Mamma sometimes
I know, I know, I know, I know, it's right there!
So I remember it exactly~
I totally know
Oh, that's right, Yena and Kiki are there
I liked Mina because she appeared in Digimon
Kiki, oh my gosh, is Yena here? I don't know her name, Kiki
I know that and Supergirls? Kiki
Yeah the main character's female name is Yena Kiki
Mina appears in Digimon
Everyone just remember your name Kiki
I know Super Girls, it was fun to watch!
What is Supergirls? Why are you talking about something I don't know! You idiots?
Kiki, there's a generation gap~!
Then Pingu, you know?
Pingu, you know, that scary seal that comes out...?
Kiki Pingu knows carrots!
Aren't these kids talking weirdly?
Kiki Woong Woong You don't talk much, but what if you do? I really liked them.
It was so cute how the soles of his feet clacked against the snow
Yeah, that's right, you're really walking like Kiki
Kiki looks like Song Songi
Do you know the Ari character from Doctor Mercy?
I've heard a lot that when I wear glasses I look like that! Phew!
Kiki, does it look similar to something?
Hey guys, do you know Wallace and Gromit?
Oh, you know, seeing the cheese trout being eaten that month made you want to try it, right?
I don't want to play with you guys...
Is this really a generation gap...?
We're not that different... why are you like that?
Are you bullying me?
This is beyond the generation gap, my sister just lived without watching TV, stupid, stupid
Sister, you're an idiot. You don't know this. You were a model student. You don't watch much TV!
Kiki, no, I know what it is just by looking at the picture...
Kiki But we have our national cartoon, Crayon Shin-chan!
Kiki is right, if you don't know Crayon Shin-chan, you're a spy!
I even played the Shinchan game~
That's right, Kiki's Crayon Shin-chan is still fun to watch, honestly
It's a real memory, a memory, it's fun, it's fun
What did you eat for lunch?
I ate cold noodles with my mom~
Wow, did you eat Pyongyang cold noodles?
No, just Kiki at the neighborhood snack shop
They've been giving out a lot of cold noodles and meat these days~
Oh really? I just wanted cold noodles?
Where is it?
These days, the new cold noodle restaurants are like that
Have you eaten cold water?
No no, I ate bean curd
Tuna mayo kimbap and black bean curd are so delicious ㅠㅠ
Ah, since it's a snack bar, you can eat a variety of foods!
Yeah right I had lunch Kiki
Yeah, I just ate too!
What did you eat today~?
I ate the curry you recommended!
Oh, that's delicious, isn't it? How was it?
Wow, this is totally my style!
I'll buy it again next time Kiki is good
If you live alone, how will you decorate your room?
These days, wooden interiors are trendy~
If it's raw wood, isn't it quite expensive?
Oh really? Places like IKEA are cheap. Kiki
Have you already seen the furniture at IKEA?
Yeah, the showroom there was pretty well done.
Oh, I see. What's a showroom?
I'm showing you the interior of a room.
I went to IKEA too, but it was all a showroom!
Yes, that's right. You can order furniture just like it is in the showroom.
What kind of furniture did you see?
First of all, I looked at the closet because it was so old ㅠㅠ
I see. How much did it cost?
It wasn't as expensive as I thought. About 100,000 won?
It's raw wood, so wouldn't a lot of people buy it at that price?
Yeah, that's right. I think it's cheap because it's self-construction.
What do you usually ride when you travel?
I mostly travel by plane, and Kiki's boyfriend lives in Busan.
Wow, isn't the plane ticket expensive?
It's twice as cheap as KTX!
Kiki is close to the airport too
Wow, that's amazing. How many hours does it take from my house to the airport?
It takes about an hour and a half
It doesn't take as long as you think. What are you riding?
I took the airport limousine bus~ It was okay
Does the airport bus go to your house too?
Yes, that's right, go to both Incheon Airport and Gimpo Airport.
Your house is totally a honeymoon house!
The metropolitan bus runs frequently in the area around our neighborhood station.
I'm jealous. My house only has one bus going into town every 20 minutes.
Oh really? The buses there need to be reorganized soon too.
No, I mean the Nonsan house hahaha.
Ah... It'll be a bit difficult there ㅠㅠ
Tea is a must Kiki
Aren't you working any other part-time jobs besides at the convenience store?
I recently worked at Coupang
Oh my, I saw an article saying Coupang was on fire recently. Is that you?
Not there, it's in a different area
Good thing, how many times have you been there?
I think I went about 3 times a week, it was so hard ㅠㅠ
Do you still plan on going?
No, I don't want to go there again
Yeah, they say convenience stores are the sweetest part-time jobs.
Yes, it's much better if you also have a convenience store.
Right? Then what did you do at Coupang?
Packing and sending out what people ordered~
How many hours a day did you do this?
Um, about 8 hours a day?
8 hours? That must be tough.
Did you give them a break?
Of course I'll give you a break~
Did your boyfriend go to the military and come back?
Oh, so you were discharged from the military this year?
So you started dating and then enlisted right away?
No, I met Kiki a few months before my discharge.
When did you say you went on a trip to Europe?
I went there 2 years ago, but we weren't dating then Kiki
So when did your boyfriend enlist?
I enlisted two weeks after returning from my trip to Europe.
At that time I was a student~
Oh, time really flies
Is it 1 year and 6 months in the military?
Yeah, that's what it's like these days.
Then how long have you been waiting for your boyfriend?
I think I waited about 6 months Kiki
Hey, I waited longer than you thought?
Kiki I don't know for sure~
Wow, time flies?
Is this the power of love?
Yeah right... I'm embarrassed hehe
What major did you study in college?
I majored in tax accounting, Kiki
I didn't go to college so I don't know what major to take. Can you tell me?
Oh, I'm learning about taxes and bookkeeping.
So, have you tried the internship?
I haven't tried the practice yet Kiki
A quick part-time job at the tax office?
Is that not an internship or a part-time job?
Yeah, I got some money there too ~ Yahoo
Wow, that's amazing. Working part-time at the tax office.
I helped you file your return during the tax season in May Kiki
Did a lot of business owners come to report at that time?
Yeah, that's right, a thousand people came in one day...
Oh my god, you reported all those people?
I reported it with the help of other people~
This is seriously awesome! My little brother is doing such an awesome job!
I'll help you file your taxes later too~
What did your brother do after he was discharged from the military?
Well, I guess I'll work part-time since I'm still young.
At least I'm glad I can earn my own living!
I'm so worried about not going to college ㅠㅠ
What certifications does he have?
Well, maybe there aren't any? Kiki
Did he graduate from a humanities high school?
Oh right, I graduated from the humanities department Kiki
Then you might not have a license
We came from the commercial world!
That's true, but he's not interested in anything ㅠㅠ
Really? You don't even have a driver's license?
Yeah, that's right. I don't even want to take that test...
But he's still young, so he'll come out and do something!
Well, I hope so, Kiki
If you do that after I come out, I'll scold you severely!
I have to chase after them with a club
What's your boyfriend doing these days?
I'm into working out these days Kiki Health
Wow my boyfriend also got PT recently
Oh really? How much does that PT cost?
I think it was 50 thousand won at once!
Wow, really? It's expensive. Are you still getting PT?
No, it's over, but I have a one month gym membership, but I'm not going
Oh really? Has anything changed since you did Kiki Piti?
Um, my stomach went in a little bit, but I recently checked and it's back to normal haha
Hey, didn't you say you were going to take a shower last time?
Yeah, it's a story from a far away country.
Well, a happy pig is the best, Kiki
Then he convinced me that healthy people have some fat.
A boyfriend with a big belly is cute too~
There has to be a limit to everything, but it's dangerous right now.
It would be perfect if my sister could exercise with me, Kiki
You said earlier that you wanted to raise a Bichon.
Oh right~ I really like Bichon ㅠㅠ
Do you know how big a Bichon is?
It doesn't seem to be a small dog, but a medium-sized dog?
Well, it depends on the size, but you can think of it as a small to medium-sized dog!
Oh really? It's smaller than I thought. I thought it was big.
Think of it as about 5kg on average!
Oh really? Is it about the same size as Obok?
Yes, the size may be a bit bigger because of the fur!
Yes, it was cute because the fur was fluffy ㅠ
Right, since you're talking about Bichon, I want to play with a Bichon too!
If you go to a dog cafe, there are a lot of Bichons. Go there sometime.
Wow, I've never been to a dog cafe before. What do you think?
He's so active that he gets tired of playing with puppies...
Wow, I should go and play sometime soon when I get the chance!
Yeah, he said you don't have to have a dog~
Did you wear hiking clothes when you went hiking?
No, I heard that a lot of people wear leggings these days.
So you went hiking wearing leggings?
Yeah, that's right, the leggings are stretchy.
I can't wear leggings.
Why? Are the leggings uncomfortable?
It's not pretty to wear it because it makes your butt sag rather than being uncomfortable.
Oh, then I guess I should do hip-up exercises!
I do squats every day?
Then try the hip bridge exercise too.
Do you also do bridge exercises every day?
Your ass is really cursed
Have you seen your big mommy butt?
Superior genes.
Genetics can't be ignored, can it?
No, this also needs the hand of God.
No, let's work together
Since you're young, do you often play drinking games with kids?
Hey, when are we going to have a drinking game?
So what do kids these days do when they drink?
Let's talk about Dorandoran instead of drinking games
Latte, as they say, if you don't have a drinking game at a drinking party, your shoulders will fall off too~
Hey~ What was the drinking game? I don't even remember.
You know what, you game
Oh~ Hey, but the classic is 369 Kiki
Ah, 369 is creepy. Does it remind you of Baskin Robbins 31 degrees?
Well, at first I thought it was an ice cream flavor contest, Kiki.
Everyone can think that way
I played the game with caution!
Yeah? I'm always drunk because I'm so oblivious when I play drinking games. Kiki
You can't do giggles?
Oh really, I was just thirsty for alcohol~
Did you purposely lose the game and drink a lot?
I got caught, I'm actually a game expert Kiki
Please recommend other travel destinations besides Busan!
Well, I recommend Jeju Island~
I was planning to go to Jeju Island, but I don't think I can go because of Corona ㅜㅜ
That's right, Jeju Island is currently at Corona level 4 ㅠㅠ
Nonsan is still at stage 3, but Jeju Island ended up like that too.
Yeah, that's right, I think it's been about two weeks ㅠㅠ
I want to go to Jeju Island
I was planning to go in October too, but I cancelled ㅜㅜ
Oh really? Who are you going with?
I was planning to go for my 7th anniversary with my boyfriend!
Oh my, that's too bad ㅠㅠ
Still went and came back
What are you going to do if you go? You'll have to pack everything and eat it!
It's okay because vacations are going well these days
Right, the price has gone down a lot, right?
The package is better than I thought, so it's worth going at least once.
I've never been on a vacation before, but I need to go make a reservation!
I think I'll go to Jeju Island soon, so I should make a reservation~
Were you in Busan this week?
Yeah that's right but it rained the whole time ㅠ
Right, I heard a typhoon came there?
Yeah, Typhoon Omais hit us directly.
The typhoon's name is Oh My! What an interesting name!
The rain was so heavy that I couldn't see ahead.
Wow, but how was your trip?
Weren't you scared?
My boyfriend rented a car and drove around, but it was scary because there was no visibility.
How did you drive so well?
Look how good your boyfriend drives!
Luckily, I guess it's because he's a local person. Kiki
They say that Busan's transportation isn't even that good!
Yeah, that's why it was so congested ㅠㅜ
They say Busan cars are incredibly violent. Is that true?
Oh, that's not it, but the lanes are complicated ㅠㅠ
Yeah, I heard the roads are bumpy in a lot of places!
Yeah, yeah, I felt that too. It's more dangerous when it rains.
I really need to be careful about food poisoning these days!
Yeah, we've had a lot of food poisoning recently because of salmonella.
They say they caught it in a group, but one person died!
Wow, it's scary. Especially the kimbap places are like that a lot.
I guess it's because there are a lot of vegetables inside
Where is the kimbap place?
It's a kimbap restaurant in Goyang, and they say there are a lot of problems with the vegetables and eggs.
That's right, that's because those eggs aren't washed eggs!
You really have to be careful with what you eat in the summer.
That's right, salmonella starts in eggs!
Do you eat eggs often?
Oh right, that's why I'm being more careful ㅠㅠ
They told me to eat eggs that are antibiotic-free, even if they are expensive!
Oh really? I didn't know that ㅠㅠ
But if you're careful, it'll be okay~
That's right. You shouldn't buy only what you'll eat and hoard it!
And I hope restaurants also manage hygiene well.
Yeah, that kimbap place is going to go out of business soon ㅜㅜ
Don't play with your food~
Have you seen the Fukushima nuclear disaster?
So how much damage was that?
How can you release it so subtly?
I heard that the Fukushima nuclear power plant released contaminated water this time. What should we do? Really?
Do you know how much contaminated water there is?
I also saw the article indirectly and I think there may have been damage to seafood.
Oh, I really like raw fish, but do I have to eat it only in Western form?
The form can also be dangerous ㅠㅠ If exposed to radiation...
But why do they release it so freely?
Japan is really selfish
Don't even think about the surrounding countries that are affected
I think it's really too much. We're going crazy because of Corona right now!
Well, I think our country needs to deal with this well too ㅠㅠ
Right, isn't there an alternative to stop that?
Diplomacy between the two countries needs to go well.
I don't think that's the case
If there are parts that need to be adjusted, I hope you do so wisely!
Yeah, I think so too
Are you doing well with your diet these days?
No I gave up on dieting Kiki
Why, why were you doing so well!
I'm just so happy eating these days~
By the way, aren't you exercising?
Yeah, just go outside and take a walk when you're bored?
It's okay though because I'm moving. I'm taking diet pills!
Oh, what kind of medicine are you taking?
I'm just taking diet pills that celebrities are promoting!
Oh, is that something like a supplement?
Yeah, that's right. If you eat that, your appetite will improve!
So you can lose weight without exercising?
No, I don't think that's it. Just maintain it?
Oh, I want to keep it!
How much weight have you gained?
I think I gained about 3kg recently ㅠㅠ
Hey, do you know that your sister is hurt?
Hey, where did you get hurt, unnie?
Sister, both of my legs are broken.
What were you doing that made you shiver? What happened? ㅠㅠ
He sprained his leg while going to buy ice cream.
But both your legs are broken? Wow...
No, he came out with half a cast on one leg, then fell and hurt his other leg too.
Oh really? That would be uncomfortable for both of us...
He said it was because he had no strength in his legs.
My sister needs to take care of me
Mom will take care of it
It's all because of lack of exercise!
So, doesn't your sister usually exercise?
Then let's not do it. Let's work hard and take care of our health!
If you have some motor skills, you won't get hurt ㅠㅠ
Okay, so let's start exercising again!
Okay, good! Let's start with light squats.
I told you I posted on Carrot Market!
Yeah, I told you that.
Did I even tell you the story of the sale?
Oh no~ Did you sell the thing you were going to put up on Carrot Market?
I posted it in August, but no one paid attention.
Yeah, that's what I said
So I wasn't paying attention, but then two people contacted me!
Oh, that's good. So who are you going to sell it to?
I told the person who contacted me first that I could sell it, but he said he bought it and sold it to someone else who contacted him!
Oh really? I guess you're secretly popular, Kiki.
No, I put it up really cheap!
Wow, you gave it to me for such a low price. I would have bought it too. Kiki
That's right, the original price was over ten thousand won, but I listed it for 4,000 won!
Wow it's really cheap Kiki
It's almost like giving away for free, Kiki
Right? I'm such an angel hahaha!
Then, put it up for cheap next time too, Kiki
Do you have a favorite celebrity?
I'm into Song Kang these days, Kiki
Have you seen the drama with Song Kang and Han So-hee?
I know, but is that right?
I saw Kiki once
My sister told me to watch it, but I didn't watch it and it was already finished
It's all on Netflix. Check it out.
But that one has low viewer ratings, is it really that fun?
Kiki, I think the development is a bit frustrating
Still, Song Kang is handsome
Song Kang appears as a bad guy, but his face is everything!
Even though he's a bad guy, I'm attracted to him.
After all, a person's face is everything!
Han So-hee who appears there is also very pretty
Since the main characters are handsome men and beautiful women, I have to watch it when I get the chance~
Yeah, there was a short highlight on YouTube.
Yeah, I saw that a little bit!
Yeah, I'm going to watch it all at once when I have time.
Do you watch cartoons?
I really like the cartoon Crayon Shin-chan
Oh, that's a national cartoon. What base is it now?
I think it's over 16?
But these days it's not that great
This is the longest-running program. Is it not so good because the voice actors have changed?
Yeah, that's right, it's not Shinchan's dad's signature voice ㅠㅠ
Right, didn't Shin-chan change either?
Oh really? It's a bit different. The old Shinchan was more fun.
Yeah, it's more humorous, isn't it? Is Bong Mi-seon still the same?
Yeah, that's right, but I still really liked the old feeling
That's right, but I think it's become less fun these days because there are so many sanctions in place.
That could be it Kiki
Sometimes I search YouTube for old videos of Shinchan.
Should I watch a movie after a long time?
Which Shinchan movie do you like?
There's that thing called going back to the old days!
Oh, I know that too. I enjoyed watching it.
Did you all have coffee this morning?
I skipped coffee today~ I drank iced tea instead~
Did you drink your morning coffee?
Good morning everyone! I'm drinking now...
I drank it to wake up in the morning, but it was too cold, so I poured hot water and drank it Kiki
I also walked in the morning and it was hot so I rode on ice, but now it's cold...
I still can't drink hot water well Kiki
Do you usually drink Americano? Without syrup?
I drink well! Well, in the past, when I wanted something sweet, I would put syrup in it and drink it, but I try not to drink syrup, so these days, I just drink it.
Me too, without syrup!
If I want something sweet, I just drink something like vanilla latte~ Other than that, I like Americano Kiki
Didn't your sister just say she doesn't eat it?
I drink Americano as an aa, but I usually drink it with syrup. Kiki, my taste buds are still young~
Have you tried almond syrup?
Oh, I've heard that almond syrup is delicious, but I've never tried it!
If you ask for it at any store, will they put it in for you...?
Are there other stores too?
I think it tastes similar to hazelnut syrup...
I don't think I've seen it much anywhere else
Usually they have vanilla syrup, hazelnut syrup, and caramel syrup, but I saw it at Mammoth before~
Oh, what I heard was hazelnut Kiki I
I have a weak stomach so I drink very weak drinks. How do you all drink it?
My stomach isn't that good either... but I like strong flavors ㅠㅠ
If you don't say anything, they usually give you two shots~
Just almond syrup~! Oh my~ I want some
Yeah yeah that's why I asked for just one shot Kiki
Do you like acidic coffee? I don't like acidic coffee;
Oh.. I don't like sour things either... Most people don't like them. What about you?
I also went to a personal coffee shop last time, and they had coffee beans by type, but the coffee bean origins weren't that great~ I tried Yirgacheffe because it was recommended, but it was sour, not so great ㅠㅠ
I think it would be better to just sue or something like that
You like things like affogato, right?
I like it~ I don't like it because it has ice cream in it, so I don't use it
But the coffee is strong so it might not suit you~ How about this?
I really like avocado Kiki, but it was really delicious mixed with ice cream.
Yeah, yeah, it's delicious. Hehe, how about something like green tea?
Green tea latte and stuff like that
I don't like the taste of green tea, so I hardly ever drink it~
I do eat ice cream, but now that I think about it, Kiki, I really have a childish palate.
So what if it's for children's taste!
I like green tea, matcha, and all that! But it's been a long time since I've had a green tea latte.
Do you like decorating your house or room?
I love it so much~ I move the furniture around in my room and decorate it by myself Kiki
Do you like it?
I don't think... I'm really interested Kiki
Just living as is... what does it feel like? If it's not uncomfortable?
Kiki I'm very interested, but I don't seem to move often!
I like looking at things that are nicely done. Going to IKEA is also fun~
I haven't been to the first IKEA in Gwangmyeong. It's far from my house.
Instead, if you have something decorated around the house, go in and take a look, and you'll end up with more stuff piling up in your room ㅠㅠ
Ah, I really want to go to IKEA Gwangmyeong ㅠㅠ I heard it's really nicely decorated and fun to look around.
So, everyone, what color and tone do you have for your rooms? Are they all the same?
My house is almost entirely white, and things like the dining table and bed are made of wood!
My house also has a bit of white wood mixed in~
My room has a sky blue point wallpaper that I like. I did it back when point wallpaper was popular.
Oh wow, that's amazing. I think white and wood are the easiest to decorate with and they feel a little less betraying.
That's right, it doesn't follow the trend very much~
But at first, I tried to keep it to a minimum so as not to create too much luggage, but it seems like it keeps increasing one by one.
That's right~ You shouldn't buy everything just because it's prettyㅠㅠ They all become trash~~
Do you have a stand or something like that at home? Or a mood light?
Woof woof! The living room lights are white? I don't like them that much, so Kiki usually has the stand on~
I bought it at IKEA!
There's a small thing~ I turn it on when I turn off all the lights at night~ I like bright things, so I usually leave the lights on!
Do you like it dark and the stand on?
Well, I like the dark and I need it to be completely dark when I sleep, so I don't use mood lighting.
But the atmosphere was good ㅠㅠ
Yeah I like it! So put something on a timer in your room Kiki
It turns off automatically when you lie down and play for a while and then go to sleep.
When I sleep, my room is completely dark~ I only turn on the light in the living room Kiki
These days, there are a lot of mood lights that have photos and humidifiers and such items.
Oh, that's right, there are so many pretty things these days ㅠㅠ
This is the first time I've heard of photos being included. It's amazing.
Yeah, that's right, I'm hearing it for the first time too!
Do you have any plants growing inside your home?
I had them, but the temperature is nice these days and there are a lot of bugs, so I put them all outside~
So, as soon as I open the front door and go in, the scent of flowers comes out~ It feels like my stress is relieved~
I have a plant growing in the living room, but my dad takes care of it so I don't really care about it. Kiki
Just when a new sprout comes out, I go, &quot;Ohhh!&quot;
Kiki, my mom grows a lot of succulents on the veranda...
Even though I kept handing it out, it kept increasing
Wow~ What is a succulent? It seems to have a very good reproductive capacity.
I heard that succulents are good for growing small plants at home, but is it popular because they don't die easily?
When it comes to cars, do you prefer sedans or SUVs?
I used to like SUVs, but these days I prefer passenger cars with a good ride quality~
Have your tastes changed, Kiki? What about you?
Hmm... I think SUV is a little better!
I like SUV better too!
Do you usually drive?
When going out to play, an SUV is better~
I don't usually drive. What about you?
I often drag you wherever I go! What about your sister?
I don't really have anything to do with it on weekdays, but I take it with me when I go out on weekends~
SUVs are more comfortable to drive~
If you are driving an SUV and then suddenly start driving a passenger car, you will be really confused and not be able to see ahead.
Oh, I don't know because I only drive SUVs and never cars!
Do you have a dream car?
The view is a bit different!
I don't have anything in particular in mind... Range Rover or Porsche Macan? ^^ Haha, because it's a dream...
Because it's a dream, I'm going to Lincoln Kiki
Have you ever driven an open car?
I heard a lot of people ride it in Jeju Island and other places.
Yeah! Last year I went to Jeju Island and rented a BMW Z4 and the weather was nice so it was really nice ㅠㅠ
It seems a bit like a servitude...
I don't like open cars because of the hot sun and wind.
Do you like it?
No, no, I haven't ridden it, but my parents said they rode it once in Jeju Island and that once was enough, so Kiki
They said it was a bit noisy even with the lid closed
Kiki, right? It's Jeju Island, so I opened the lid. I don't think I can open it here.
If you pass by Yeongdong Bridge at night, you'll see it~
I think I see at least one if I go to Konkuk University on the weekend~
But Kiki, your face is red because of the sunlight
Kiki, wow, that's really brave, but if you open it and drive around in Seoul, you'll probably inhale all the exhaust fumes.
So... is there any point in opening it when the signal will keep going on? Kiki
So~ it's self-satisfaction~
But I think it would be convenient to have my own car, but I'm worried because I heard it costs a lot to maintain it. I don't plan on buying one though...
Right... It's not the end of a car accident ㅠㅠ
Still, I hope that everyone can drive their dream car later.
Right! What's your dream car?
I don't know much about cars, so I don't have a dream car ㅠㅠ
I just wish the Kona I have now was my car Kiki
Before doing this job, what did you do or what did you want to do?
Ah, I think I wandered around a lot trying to find what I wanted to do~Kiki
But I like my current job and it seems to fit my aptitude, and although I can't pinpoint exactly what it is, I think this is something I wanted to do.
I worked part-time at a refining shop from home before I came here. Kiki, so I think I got picked...
Well, I'd like to try working in subtitled broadcasting too!
Would it be better if I worked from home?
I think it would be good because it would save commuting time.
Kiki, I'm curious too. How was working from home?
Yeah, it was good!
At that time, I was studying, so I was able to finish my work quickly and then study, so it was good to do both, but I think the fact that it wasn't a contract job and just a part-time job was a big difference!
So, is that salary determined based on the amount of work done?
It won't be a fixed salary like ours, right?
That's what they say about working from home~ They calculate it by the number of hours you work! Right?
It was per hour of work!
So back then I made a lot of money by moving quickly in the world... haha
Kiki It seems like it would be good and it seems like it would be bad. What do you think is better? Working from home or commuting.
Yeah~ I'm curious too. Which one was better?
Well, working from home is good if you start studying at the same time, but I think commuting to work is better because it allows you to build up your career!
But now I want to work from home. I want to go to Kiki's house... ahem
Kiki I'll have to try working from home later when I get the chance.
Sister, are you thinking of doing it too?
If you have the chance, try it~
Are you thinking of doing it again?
Um... If there's nothing else to do, then of course I'll do it... right...? Kiki
What kind of part-time jobs have you had before?
I've only ever done tutoring part-time work~
Have you ever worked part-time?
I used to work part-time at restaurants! Drinks, packaging, things like that!
Oh~ I worked part-time at a school and a cafe!
What subject did you take private tutoring?
All of the liberal arts in the first year of high school~ Since she came from a foreign country, I just looked at her overall because of her school grades~
I haven't done much tutoring, but my school teacher put me in touch with just that one kid~
Wow... This is awesome. Even if I had the ability, I'd be scared of someone teaching me, so I couldn't do it. ㅠㅠ
Kiki, I'm going to ask you something I don't know
I've never had a tutor before
Yeah, I was worried at first, but I couldn't refuse after being asked to do it, so it was just okay Kiki
It was fun, but I couldn't do it for long because of my studies~
First of all, I have to work hard at what I'm doing now ㅠㅠ Kiki
Is there anyone around you who served in the military as a KATUSA or in some other unusual place?
There are Marines and Air Force, but no KATUSAs~
Are you around?
Wow, there's nothing special about me since everyone around me is in the army and navy;
My brother applied to be a self-propelled artillery mechanic and got in, but the unit didn't have any self-propelled artillery Kiki
Kiki, what was your position then?
I had a few KATUSA's when I was in school!
Seriously, what the heck? You applied and went, but you got assigned to a place that didn't exist? ㅠㅠ
What is different about working as a KATUSA?
Yeah, so that's why he said he got a total honey-suck;
I didn't like it and wanted to have a hard time, but it's a real sibling relationship
Kiki: All the kids who I thought would have a hard time ended up going to good places...
I don't know much about KATUSA training, but it seems like they live with American soldiers and have a relatively free atmosphere.
Kiki, didn't you cry when you went into the army?
Oh, but I cried a little when I entered Nonsan Training Center!
I'm a little surprised that so many people go to the military every week...!
Oh... I've never cried while sending anyone off haha What about you, sis?
I cried, but Kiki later came with shoes and clothes~ Even then, I held on to them and cried Kiki
Was it your older brother or younger brother?
When my younger brother goes to the military, my older sisters cry a little... Oppa... um...
My sister is my brother too! To the point of crying...
Kiki Actually, I didn't feel anything until I followed them to the training camp, but when they finally went in, everyone saluted and went in~ I cried from then on.
I think Kiki cried more because his mom was crying too
Oh... That's amazing... I just cut my brother's hair short and it felt good so I just kept patting it Kiki
Kiki touch but I know what it feels like... I'm secretly addicted to Kiki
Are there any female soldiers around you?
Yeah, I wanted to go, Kiki
Oh, I really wanted to go for a bit too, but I gave up right away because I can't do a single sit-up...
Wow, really? I never even thought about it Kiki
Sister, but somehow the image suits you well
Kiki Whale~? If I had received support from my class, I would have gone right away~
So, it matches well with my sister's image, Kiki
I think she would have done really well even if she had been a female soldier
Yeah, it suits you well!
But I think everyone's stamina is weak
Kiki is okay as a civilian, but not good enough to be a soldier. Kiki
Have you had any female soldiers around you?
No, there isn't one around or far away ㅠㅠ
Do you have any other certifications besides a shorthand certificate? Computer or something like that?
For computers, there's MOS and information processing industry engineer. What about you?
Wow I have no shame and nothing hahaha
Even if I get a shorthand license, there are still so many things I need to get ㅠㅠ
Are there many other things that need to be followed?
I also have Morse and information processing skills! I have computer skills, but I didn't get a level 1... It's hard...
First of all, the most important thing is the shorthand~ ㅠㅠ
Well, I need to get some computer skills, and it would be good to get a secretarial license, and I also need to get Word...
I think everyone follows these three as basics...?
Ah, there is no word...
Since you're still at an age where you can take your time, just take it one step at a time~
Right~ I don't think you need to think about it so hastily~
Do you have a secretarial license?
ㅠㅠ I keep feeling impatient... I keep thinking that I have to hurry up and do it quickly.
They say that if you have a secretary's license and a shorthand license, you are exempt from the practical test!
Oh, does that apply to shorthand certification too? Gulkunang!
I have computer skills, so they exempted me from the practical test. Kiki
Kiki, you know there's something called a secretary license~ Kiki, I meant, do you have one? Kiki
Aaaah, no, there are many things that Kiki's secretary license is exempt from, so I'll get it later!
I have it! That's why I was exempted from the practical test because I have computer skills~~
Oh~ cool cool~
Are there any other qualifications you would like to obtain?
Ohhhh, personally, what I want to get is a Korean history certificate!
I don't have any qualifications... I just want to study a foreign language steadily, but it doesn't work out the way I want.
I like Korean history too~ I want to learn a foreign language~
These days, when I watch Japanese dramas, I want to learn Japanese again~ I also want to learn piano again~
Wow, I also want to learn piano, English conversation, badminton, and swimming... I'm full of desires.
Kiki, you all have a lot of things you want to do, you're so passionate~
There are a lot of things I want to learn, but I don't have time and it's annoying. I'll try to do them one by one after the Kiki exam.
Alright~ Once the exams are over, there's Chuseok so I'm happy, happy~
Wow, are you two taking the test? Where?
I'm Kyungbok! I've never been to a chamber of commerce before, so I just went there ㅠㅠ
I'm in the sky~ I've only done it there~
Oh, I can see you from above, Sister! Kiki
Have you been on a trip with your parents recently?
Even though it's recent, it was a year ago ㅠㅠ Because of Corona~
Kiki Hot Springs in Daejeon
Oh my, I came to Sokcho to play with my mom!
Even though I was almost stuck at the resort...!
Sokcho is my last too! It's been quite a while ㅠㅠ
Do you and your mom often go out to play together?
I often go out with my mom~
Before Corona, I went to many places~ It's really a shame ㅠㅠ
I used to go there often with my mom too!
Mom and Dad both enjoy traveling! It's a bit difficult these days though ㅠㅠ
But the two of you did go on a vacation though!
Right, I was looking into going on a trip to Singapore with my mom early last year when the coronavirus broke out... I was shaking.
I was planning to go see my aunt soon too ㅠㅠ
Is there a place you couldn't go because of Corona?
Originally, I was going to go to Seonjae Island with my friends last week, but suddenly the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 reached 2,000, so of course, we canceled ㅠㅠ
Seonjaedo? Where is that? This is the first time I've heard of it!
That's right, Seonjae... There are so many islands in our country, Kiki
Where are you? Introduce me~
Seonjae-do is said to be in Incheon, but I think it's in Gyeonggi-do!
But I usually go to places I've always been to, like Sokcho or Jeju Island with my family... and I don't really go to new places...!
Yes, it's too far, so I have to make a long schedule and it's hard to coordinate with my family's schedule~
Yeah, that's right~ And it's fun to go on adventures with family, so when I make a reservation, I always make a reservation at the place I stay at~
And what should I say, since it's a trip with my parents, I'm worried about trying a new place.
I think I'll just go there and rest and come back, because I don't think I'll like it if I go there for no reason.
When you go on a family trip, do you usually make plans?
Your parents will just follow you?
Yeah, I do that too. My brother used to do it mostly, but it seems like it's mine these days...
Well, when it comes to overseas travel, I almost always plan it myself, and when it comes to domestic travel... Actually, my mom and dad know a lot, so I just look for pretty cafes?
Oh my goodness, when Dad is involved, there are places he wants to go and other times it's like I'm the one who wants to go!
But when you make plans, mom usually likes it, but dad seems less satisfied. How is your house?
Um... Generally, we just go to the same places we always go, and my dad is satisfied with just traveling and healing, and my mom is satisfied with that itself?
Kiki, you only go to the same places
Kiki: Well then, it's good because it doesn't have to be hard to plan~
My dad is satisfied with just delicious food and alcohol.
My dad likes to look around~ He likes to experience things more than healing
My dad seems to like hiking... Kiki
Do you have any romantic ideas about weddings?
An outdoor wedding or a small wedding or something like that.
Ah, I wanted a small outdoor wedding~
I saw that place when I was in high school ㅠㅠ
It disappeared a while ago there ㅠㅠ
I also had a romantic idea for an outdoor wedding, but people kept saying it wasn't very good because there were no lights. Kiki
But it's still romantic, so I still romanticize an outdoor wedding.
Right, the lighting ㅠㅠ My friend is like that, so he has one outside and the bolt touch is really strong! It's like this, Kiki
I think the outdoors is really pretty when the weather is nice... but if it rains... that's a problem
My friend went to Jeju Island this time, and he prepared both indoor and outdoor activities in case the weather was bad.
Oh, that's right, that's right. The Sogun couple on YouTube had their wedding outside, but when I looked at the contract, they had a contract to have it indoors in case it rained.
That's right, you need to have a plan B...
These days, it's forced small-scale, but I think it's pretty to make it a little smaller and more cute.
I like flowers, so I wanted to arrange tables in a small square shape and decorate the surrounding area with flowers, without doing anything like a parade~
Oh right ㅠㅠ The more flowers there are at the wedding hall, the prettier it is...
I worked part-time at a wedding, holding dresses, and at that time, I felt like I was taking a picture of the bride and groom, so I thought I would not get married and travel with that money! I was a little young, but now I want to do it.
Wow, you did that kind of part-time job too? That's amazing Kiki
I thought the dress shop lady would just do it for me!
I also really hate it when they take pictures at wedding halls every 30 or 40 minutes ㅠㅠ
I hate that too, and so do wedding photos~ But I think it would be too sad not to do it again, so isn't there a different way?
So maybe that's why small weddings are popular now?
It's not just for the purpose of collecting money from my parents, but I really want to celebrate with my friends and I!
That's right, I think that's why many people want to have outdoor weddings!
But there are many parents who secretly want to get back the money they have spent...
Kiki, you're right, you've been going around too much Kiki
That's why I told you from the beginning, Kiki, don't do that because of me. I don't accept condolence money~
I just asked and my dad said he didn't care but my mom said she had to take it
Kiki: That may be true, but in the end, you'll be told to do whatever you want~
What about the dress? Is there a style you want to wear?
I used to not really want to wear dresses, but I started to want to wear them more and more~ with tube tops~
Hmm... I just want to wear the most basic things!
Mermaid is a bit shy... Kiki
Kiki Mermaid definitely looks good on tall people~
And it has to be dry... Kiki
I don't think dieting before marriage is a waste of time...
Did your sister have a wedding ceremony?
No, I wasn't there! I just read the marriage contract and the fathers of both families read the letter and the marriage declaration and that's it.
Where did you get it done? What wedding dress did you wear?
I have so many questions~ What about the congratulatory song?
Oh, a lot of people do that these days.
I also want to do it like that later, but I'm worried about the letters from my father-in-law.
Did you ever raise a hamster when you were young?
None~ I've never raised anything other than a puppy~ What about you?
I don't have a hamster either, but my friend had about 3.
Wasn't there at least one person raising one around you?
Yeah, there was one~ I tried raising one too!
It was a golden hamster... Anyway, it was much faster than the average hamster.
There are different types of hamsters~
The name of the species is so cute, Golden Hamster~
Oh, I see. I never thought there would be different types of hamsters. They're so cute.
Have you ever put your hamster in a ball or something and let it wander around?
What is a hamster ball? I've never heard of it before...
Oh, is there something like that? What is it?
If hamsters go outside their cages, they might accidentally step on something or something, so you can put them in something like a round, clear plastic ball so they can run around on their own?
There was something like that? I saw it in a webtoon Kiki
Wow Kiki is cute. At first glance, Kiki is just a ball rolling around? Kiki is so cute.
They say they protect hamsters, but will hamsters like it?
Kiki, I think you'll be frustrated
Oh, but since you can run as you please, it's like taking a walk! Everyone likes it.
I think you'd like it if you just stayed in that cage and came out!
What else does a hamster like?
Oh, do you really like sunflower seeds and things like that?
Yeah, I think I ate sunflower seeds with rice?
I don't remember what else I gave him... I was in elementary school.
Have you ever raised a chick?
In the past, they used to sell a lot of it in front of elementary schools~
I saw a lot of them for sale, but I didn't really think about buying them and just passed by Kiki
Kiki, me too... I don't like birds ㅠㅠ
Have you ever raised your sister?
No~ I couldn't raise it because I thought I'd die soon~
I think my heart will hurt too much
Oh, that's right, that's right ㅠㅠ But there were a lot of stories about how they even raised chickens, like a legend.
Never been around Kiki
Kiki, that's right, I've heard that kind of story often.
Even though they are cute like parrots, birds are so disgusting...
I don't really like birds like pigeons and such ㅠㅠ
I hate fussing too ㅠㅠ
Do you like camping or other outdoor activities?
I don't really like to sleep over, so just going for a day trip is always okay~
Oh I love it... indoors Kiki
Kiki Oh really? Why are there bugs and such?
Indoors... Where do you like to play?
Um... I don't know if there's anyone here who likes camping, but I just don't like cooking and sleeping outside because it's uncomfortable and doesn't feel like I'm resting...
I feel like I'm working a little bit... Kiki
I haven't tried it yet! Bugs are one of the big reasons! Indoors, usually in resorts or hotels...
Of course, resorts and hotels are more convenient for sleeping and washing...
That camping experience has its own unique flavor!
Eat something delicious outside and have a fire pit~
Bullmong and watermong definitely relieve stress~
I also hate sleeping in because it's inconvenient to wash up. But I love the feeling of being in nature!
Oh, I guess I don't know what it tastes like because I've never tried it!
So do you usually use glamping?
No I'll just go!
Sleeping in the car, sleeping in the tent ~
I'll just take what I have and come back later~
The food is packaged in a way that makes it easy to boil and eat, so buy that and take it with you~
These days, they sell food in aluminum containers that you can boil and eat haha
Oh wow, what is this? You all have been camping a lot.
If you sleep in the car, do you just lie down in the back seat of the car and sleep under a blanket?
Yeah, lie down and spread out a blanket or sleeping bag or something and go to sleep!
But it's definitely uncomfortable... When I wake up, I feel like I got beaten up by someone ^^
Kiki, it's hot in the summer, cool in the morning, and cold in the winter. Ugh~
Oh... how amazing... this is an unknown world, Kiki
So you have to start the fire yourself? Are you good at it?
Yeah, all by myself! Kiki, but I've never done it myself... My husband did it all... haha
These days, you put them in fire, and there are even things that make the fire change into colorful colors!
There are so many really good ones coming out these days~
But I don't have Kiki, I just have the basics~
My dad likes that kind of thing
Wow, that's crazy. The lights are so colorful...
Then how do I wash the dishes? Is there a separate place to wash them?
There is a sink where you can wash your dishes. There are some nice campsites where you can wash your dishes and other things!
Warm water also comes out
I find that annoying too, so I mostly just use disposable ones, or sometimes I just bring my own~
Oh, if I go, I think I'll just use disposable products like my sister
So, which do you prefer, the mountains or the sea?
I like them both... Hmm, but I like the ocean a little better
I like mountains more, regardless of camping~
Aaaah, no matter what, I think I like indoors better... haha
Did you go to the arcade often when you were young?
I went to high school often, Kiki
When I go to the movie theater, I always stop by the arcade first and then watch the movie~
There wasn't really an arcade, but there was one attached to a snack shop? I've never been there. Kiki
Is there an arcade in the snack shop? You mean the one with one or two machines in front of the store...?
What did you usually do when you went to the mask?
Something that kills by shooting a gun, and something that looks like a pump and a ping-pong table, but you can block it with your hand... I don't know the name of it~
Ahhh, that arcade! There's no one around the school, so I rarely go there ㅠㅠ
I've been there once or twice, but I just watched friends beating drums to the beat of music.
Oh, that ping-pong table thing is a flat plastic thing? Kiki
Are you talking about the push-in thing...? I don't know the name.
Oh, I was doing that Kiki, and I was late for the movie once~
There were things like buddy buddy and riding a motorcycle, and there were a lot of fun things~
Oh right, I've done that a few times Kiki
It's really nothing special, but I got competitive and tried to block it somehow.
Kiki, right? That's fun. What's something like buddy buddy?
Have you ever played the classic game Buddy Buddy?
Popping balloons~ It was there back in the days when Tetris existed...
Are you talking about Bubble Bubble...?
Those two dinosaurs come out and pout?
What is it... It's not bubble bubble...? It's something where you stick Kiki marbles on and pop them... All sorts of names are coming out.
Yes, that's Kiki. In my opinion, it's the ancestor of Anipang~
What's the exact name Kiki?
Ah, Bubble Bubble Kiki, I did this and that Snow Brothers too
What is the progenitor of Anipang?
I haven't played Anipang...
Ah, Bubble Bubble, that's the ancestor of Anipang, Kiki
The ending of Bubble Bubble is so touching... if you kill the first boss, your curse will be lifted and you'll turn into a human, if you kill the second boss, your girlfriend will be released, and if you kill the last boss, your parents will be released from the curse...
Wow... I didn't know there was a story like that Kiki
Is your name Bubble Bubble?
Oh, so there's a story to that too?
I guess you didn't make it to the end~ I've never seen it before
Yeah, I looked it up and it's Bubble Bubble, Kiki
Of course, I never went all the way to the end, but I once went around with a bubble bubble ending.
Do these games usually have zombies in them?
A game where you shoot directly at the screen with a gun?
I'm worried that zombies or monsters might appear... I haven't tried that ㅠ
I think I was a human~ If I were a police officer, wouldn't I have been an enemy?
Oh wow, that's amazing. The stories seem to be quite diverse.
Where do you travel most often in Korea?
It's not a tourist destination, but I go to Daejeon often~
Oppa, you're from Ulsan, so we'll meet in the middle. Kiki, what about you?
My family goes to Sokcho a lot to play!
Is it easy to go to rest?
I also go to Sokcho or other areas in Gangwon-do
I've never been to Daejeon properly. Is there a lot to see?
There's not much to see~
I have a nephew, so we go to an amusement park or a zoo~ We sit at a cafe and play, and Kiki and the adults go to a hot spring or a bakery~
There's a bread road in Daejeon~
If you have a little niece, you'll probably go to a lot of cute places like that. Kiki is so cute. ㅜㅜ
I really want to go to a hot spring...
Recommend a good place
That's right. I've only been to ryokans in Japan and I've never been to a Korean hot spring... I want to go. Please recommend one!
There used to be famous places like Daejeon and Chungju~
These days, the hot spring water has dried up, so there are many places that only have a name.
The Daejeon I'm going to was also famous for its Yuseong hot springs in the past, but it's become a bit less popular now...
But it was okay after doing it. It was close so I went there and I heard that Deokgu and Punggi hot springs were good~
Oh, really, after my exams are over, I want to go somewhere like that and relax... But I think the coronavirus situation needs to calm down a bit before I can go somewhere with peace of mind ㅠㅠ
Yeah, hot springs and swimming pools are especially a bit like that... A vacation isn't complete without swimming, though...
Are you all good at swimming?
Before Corona, did you enjoy swimming when you traveled?
Oh, I learned it in elementary school, but I forgot it all. Kiki
Is it because I don't have the stamina I had back then? Kiki, that's why I want to learn again ㅠㅠ
I learned it when I was in elementary school, and now I just flounder around. But since it's not like swimming on a rail, but just playing in the water, I do it often!
I also want to be a great swimmer, but my skill level is the same as my niece's, so playing with Kiki is perfect~
So do you like a pool with a bit of a rail or do you like a pool that's just like a pool?
It depends on who you go out with
I'm just like a pool!
Do you know about the resort called Parkrosi in Jeongseon? Have you been there?
No, I haven't been there. Gangwon-do is far from Ulsan, so I don't go there often.
My dad always says that the whole family has to go out and play together. Kiki
It seems like you've hardly ever been to Jeongseon!
I guess I'll have to put that on my to-do list, Kiki.
What do you usually eat when you go?
There's really nothing around there, so you have to deal with it inside, but it's really the best for healing...
It even includes yoga and exercise programs, and there's a swimming pool and jacuzzi!
If you pay extra, there are things like cooking classes. Go and try it out, Kiki.
If there's nothing around, I'll really have to play inside~
When there are a lot of things to do around, it's a shame that you often end up not being able to use anything inside.
Wow, it's so good...? Personally, for me who just likes to sit down and rest, this is the perfect place Kiki
I'm telling you because I think you'll like it!
When I go to Gangwon-do... it's different every time, but I usually eat things like raw fish, potato pancakes, and makguksu haha. Sometimes I eat fried chicken too.
Just hearing Gangwon-do is healing~
That's why ㅠㅠ I only like hoerang potato pancake and fried chicken... I'm hungry
What is your favorite season of the four seasons?
Me, summer~ Kiki, there aren't many people who like summer
What season do you like?
Hmm...I'm fall!
Summer is nice, but these days, summer is getting too humid and difficult, so it seems like there are fewer and fewer people who say they like summer.
Yeah, but if it were just a little less humid it would be okay...
I like spring the best hehe
Is there a reason why fall is better than spring?
What's the difference between spring and fall? Kiki
Oh, I have a bit of a pollen allergy... I love spring and I really, really like flowers...
Now it has become a scary thing ㅠㅠ
Aha... I also have rhinitis, so I sneeze a lot during the changing of seasons ㅠㅠ
Pollen allergies must be tough, having allergies at the most beautiful time of the year...
People with severe pollen allergies sneeze constantly~ ㅠㅠ
Is it worse even if I take medicine?
Well, I guess I go to the ophthalmologist and get a prescription for eye drops and take medicine for the respiratory system, and during pollen season, I go almost every week to get treatment? ㅠㅠ
Still spring... I like it... haha it's kind of pink
Oh my, this is so hard ㅠㅠ If I have to go to the hospital every week...
Yeah, somehow fall feels cold? And spring is warm! That's why I think spring is better.
Oh, it's the opposite~ I feel like spring is a bit cool and fall is a bit warm~
But winter is coming soon and I hate fall too Kiki
Ah, but actually, in our country, summers and winters have become a bit hard? The weather has become so in-between and normal...
Because it's too hot or too cold; it's painful
Yes, in the past, I could turn on the fan and endure the summer to some extent... but these days, it feels like it's really killing me ㅠㅠ
Sister, are you okay with this heat?
It doesn't seem to matter much since there's air conditioning Kiki, otherwise I'd die~
But I can't shake off this fresh, green feeling of summer. Isn't it so pretty?
The sky is my favorite color, the trees are a fresh green, the flowers and grass are all fresh~ So pretty
That's right, that's right ㅠㅠ When the weather was really cool, I felt like, &quot;Yes, this is summer ㅠㅠ&quot; The world was so green, the sky was blue, and the sunlight was bright... It was so nice ㅠㅠ
It would be much better if it were a little less hot and humid though ㅠㅠ
If it weren't for the humidity and mosquitoes, I think summer would be a little better Kiki
Winter is so cold it's miserable... weather with no middle ground
It's because of global warming ㅠㅠ The weather is a bit extreme, but it seems to be getting worse
No, but there are so many mosquitoes in the fall... I heard that they stopped being active in the summer because it was too hot, and they're only coming out now, Kiki
I got bitten once and my arm swelled up so much I was really surprised...
It was so hot, but they didn't die... Those guys are so persistent ㅠㅠ
If it was that swollen, was it something like a mosquito bite?
Do you get bitten by a lot of mosquitoes in the summer?
I used to feel like I was the only one bitten by mosquitoes in the world, but these days... everyone is getting bitten... Is that it? Kiki, it's less unfair
I tend to get bitten a lot... When I'm with other people, I get bitten by them.
I heard that mosquitoes like type O blood because of their blood type.
Oh really? ㅠㅠ I don't think I've been bitten by a mosquito once this year~
I guess there are people who are good at biting ㅠㅠ
Oh, I'm also type O. Is Kiki's blood type also a science?
Applications for the Corona National Support Fund will begin soon!
Did you know?
Yeah, I heard about that, but can we get it too?
What are the conditions?
Um... I only remember something like the median income of 80%... From what I know, they say that if you apply quickly, you can get it quickly and even make a reservation for an opening time in advance?
Oh really? Kiki, everything is fully booked. Since 88% of the population receives it, shouldn't we be able to receive it too?
But since it's a gift certificate and not money, what can you use it for?
Oh really? I heard you can get that in a variety of ways?
You can receive it as a local gift certificate, or you can receive it through a bank, or you can receive it in cash...
I'm not sure if that's true or not...
Still, since it's available at restaurants, beauty salons, convenience stores, and things like that, I think it'll be useful in a lot of places!
It's not a large amount, but...
Then shall we find out? Kiki
When do you apply~
Oh, I looked it up and it says you can go to the National Secretary's website and request a notification service.
They said they would guide you through Naver app, KakaoTalk, and Toss...
Yeah, I heard you can apply for Part 5 Zero starting September 6th!
According to the last digit of the year of birth
Ah, I see. I think it's a really unique idea to accept applications based on the last digit of the year of birth.
Oh, I didn't know this was a 5-part zero. Well, it's a good choice since it's obvious that the server will be overloaded again.
Did you see that motorcycle accident at Seolleung Station a while ago?
Ah ㅠㅠ I can't open my eyes and look ㅠㅠ My nose is tingling after seeing the text that his mother sent ㅠㅠ
Oh, I just saw the title of the article and couldn't bring myself to go in and look...
It's hard to see... but I think the truck driver must have been traumatized too ㅠㅠ
I guess it's his fault, though...
So ㅠㅠ I think it's even more regrettable that there's no one to blame
His mother would always text her son whenever she heard news of an accident ㅠㅠ
Oh, so it wasn't drunk driving or anything like that...? ㅠㅠ
The signal changed and just before we started moving, that motorcycle came zooming in front of the truck in the lowest lane...
And the truck was tall so of course I couldn't see the motorcycle in front of me, so I just drove off ㅠㅠ
Countermeasures are urgent...
Isn't there a good way? ㅠㅠ
Hmm... I guess there's nothing else to do but drive defensively, since they tell you to never drive near those big trucks.
Or maybe there is a need to eliminate blind spots such as side mirrors on large vehicles.
Yeah, you shouldn't be standing right in front of such a big truck, but I guess you didn't think about it because you thought you had to deliver it quickly...
Speed is important, but I think they need to be a little more careful.
First of all, I think we should start with education. Then~
These days, there are more delivery workers and the age range is becoming more diverse, so I think the biggest problem is that they are not receiving proper education.
Every time an accident like this happens, I hope that another one won't happen again... but it's not easy ㅠㅠ
Vietnam's lockdown due to COVID-19 may disrupt global coffee supply ㅠㅠ
Wow... They say Brazil's coffee production has decreased by 22% due to the cold wave...
Wow... I never thought about coffee, but now that I think about it, it's obvious... It can't be...
So that's right, Brazil suddenly got the worst frost ever?
But the funny thing is that Starbucks fixed the coffee purchase price so it's okay.
Why is it okay to keep the coffee purchase price fixed?
Do you already have that much coffee?
There may be a shortage, and when purchasing additional items, the original price would have gone up significantly, but since they can purchase them at the original price, isn't that saying Starbucks won't be affected?
Yes~ Starbucks has no problem operating because the price was already set when the contract was signed, but the problem is the company that supplies coffee to Starbucks, right? It's sad...
Ah, that's what you meant...
Hmm, then other brands will be hit hard; but looking at the comments, some people are saying that you can just drink coffee from other countries, and that Vietnamese coffee is trash... Is that true?
I knew it was delicious;
Oh really? I knew it was delicious too...
I guess we also eat a lot of it since it is the second largest in the world in terms of production.
Doesn't Vietnam originally love its own coffee very much?
The coffee looks delicious~
You say Vietnam is the only place where Starbucks doesn't work?
Yeah yeah I think I heard that too Kiki
They say that Malaysia has delicious coffee too... If the supply becomes that difficult, will they really start getting it from other countries?
Sure, right? But it'll be expensive...
The price of coffee isn't going to go up anymore, is it? ㅠㅠ
I'm worried... It's really hard to quit coffee...
They say there's a super strong hurricane in the US right now; it's scary.
Oh really? I guess it's because America is so big that I come here quite often.
It's like a hurricane ㅠㅠ
America is so big that the climate is so varied, and these days, global warming is really messing things up...
I once saw a tornado from afar and it was scary.
Wow, you've seen a hurricane before? That's awesome.
Did you see it when you went to see your family who lives in America?
Where did you see that? It must have been really scary.
I like observatories, so I went there and saw that thing far away~
Because the observatory is so high~
Wow, that's amazing... I know someone who was in the US and got a warning or alert for a hurricane or a tornado or something, but he just thought it would be okay and got in the car, but the car floated for a few seconds and then fell and he went straight home.
Oh my gosh... Still, it's fortunate that it only rose for a few seconds and then fell ㅠㅠ
If it gets worse, wouldn't the car just fly away?
Just like in the movies ㅠㅠ I've seen something like that in Korea too~
I thought I was watching Harry Potter when I saw the plane flying over the roof of the house in front of me~
The plane was flown as is without even flipping over~
So, it's a good thing that there's nothing like that in our country.
It's been a while since I've had my hair done, so I want to go to the hair salon...
Have you had your hair done recently?
I dyed my hair and cut it a bit too~
Recently, I dyed my hair and got a volume magic! I have to go get my roots dyed...
Oh Hong, you dyed your hair too?
It's not black, it's dark brown?
It's dark brown but it just looks black Kiki
My new sister looked at me and said she reminded me of high school Kiki
Since when did you have short hair, sister?
Have you ever had short hair?
That's right, I haven't had my hair cut completely bob-shaped since elementary school...
Almost always long hair or medium-length hair
I also had short hair late~
It's been 3 years since I started cutting it~ I've had hair shorter than this before~
I also got a bob cut once after becoming an adult and just kept growing my hair out.
They say that once you lose your short hair, you can't get rid of it, Kiki
That's right, people with short hair can't stand it anymore and keep cutting it.
That's me right now~ I've been holding back on growing my hair out, holding back on it, and cutting it again, and it's been going on for two years now~ Sigh
Do your sisters have a lot of hair?
Yeah, I have a lot... That's why I don't like it ㅠㅠ
It's long and thick, so it's hard to organize.
Me too~ That's why it's harder to grow hair
Ohhh I have really thin hair and my hair is really thin... I really want to try layering it Kiki
Kiki, everyone seems to be jealous of each other...
People with a lot of hair and people with not much hair
Wouldn't it be easier to grow hair if you have thin hair?
Well, I guess it's easier to grow hair out and manage it or dry it, but I'm still jealous of those with thick hair because they're pretty.
If I do a perm wrong, I'll immediately become Hagrid... If my bangs suit me well, I'll try to change my hair a bit more, but bangs don't suit me either ㅠㅠ
Have you ever let your bangs down?
Yeah~ I used to do it~ Now I don't do it because it's a hassle to manage~
Hagrid... I'm familiar with that word. I use that word to describe my hair too~
Hagrid Kiki Ah, that's really funny. I don't like bangs... I won't do it... ㅠㅠ
I also have a narrow forehead, so it looked a bit stuffy...
Management isn't easy either~
It's hot again in summer Kiki
Oh, I see. If you have bangs, you have to keep cutting them.
Have you ever broken something and had a cast or something?
No~ I don't have any. Do you have any?
Oh, I don't have any either...
But my brother has been broken and hurt so many times all over the world that I've seen him in Kiki casts a lot.
Me neither Kiki but after putting on the cast doesn't that part become very thin?
Yeah, I've seen it too~ It's because you don't move, so you don't have any muscles~
Aha... It's getting thinner. That's amazing. Why have I never seen it before? Kiki
Has anyone ever had an appendectomy?
No! It seems like something common, but I've never seen it around here.
Oh, I don't have any~ That hurt so much for a moment that I rolled around
Oh, I thought there would be at least one since it's so common, but there isn't one?!
Everyone is healthy, Kiki
If that bursts suddenly, it'll roll around, right?
If it doesn't burst, it won't roll haha
Even though it is a very common surgery, it is said to be very dangerous if you miss the timing.
Are the scars from the surgery still big these days?
My older brother had an appendectomy a long time ago, and he said that even then, there was hardly any scar left!
Oh, that's right. These days, it seems like most things don't leave scars!
Surgical techniques have really improved~
Has anyone had a health checkup recently?
Yeah I got it a few months ago! In June?
I didn't get it~ Did you get it?
I had a lot of enteritis this time, so I had a big one Kiki
So you got everything else in a big way? Kiki
When was the last time you received it, sister?
I think I only had a blood test~
Yeah, I had a colonoscopy and an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy.
But there's nothing wrong... so just live like you are now, Kiki
Kiki, right? My stomach is not in good condition either, so when I try it, I only get the same level of gastritis that everyone else has, and nothing else...
Oh, you're the captain too? It must have been really hard to prepare ㅠㅠ
You drank a lot, was it okay?
Oh man, that was really hard ㅠㅠ The enema really didn't taste good...
But these days, the really good places, although a bit more expensive by tens of thousands of won, come in pill form instead of powder that you mix with water!
Both require you to drink a lot of water, but... pills seem much more convenient ㅠㅠ
Coupang Rocket Fresh? Have you tried it?
I use Kiki every week. I don't go to the mart these days. I buy almost everything from there.
My mom seems to use it once a week too!
Honestly, it seems so good! It's good quality, comfortable, and not expensive!
If I order it today, will it arrive tomorrow? In the morning?
These days, the time is a bit earlier, so if you order by 11 PM, it will be delivered the next morning, and if you order after that, it will be delivered by 6 PM the next day~
That's right, that's right, they also do early morning delivery. If you look at Coupang sometimes, you'll see that they sell their remaining inventory cheaply if you go in at night!
Oh, you do that too? Sounds good!
The rest is similar to Market Kurly, but they don't have anything like a shaker.
I think it's because of the freshness
I've never used Market Kurly before. What do you think?
Oh, right, that must be the reason.
Market Kurly is used by many people who do mukbang videos on YouTube. It seems like they have some good meal kits.
Yeah, there are a lot of things like that, and there are also a lot of cheeses and drinks that aren't sold at the supermarket, so shopping is fun!
Something they don't sell at the mart?
What is an example?
Oh, that's right, that's right... I heard there are some rare products...
Or maybe they sell famous products like macarons or rice cakes!
Yeah, they even sell things like Notted Bread!
It's too extensive to list, but Kiki
What do you usually buy from Market Kurly or Coupang?
I don't use it, but my mom usually uses milk or something... I only know milk Kiki um
I also bought milk and eggs... I also bought things like cream cheese and all sorts of things.
I also just buy side dishes and raw vegetables there~
Because of Corona, I don't feel like going to the supermarket, so this is convenient.
Does Market Kurly also have a separate shipping fee?
Actually, I don't know because it's been a long time since I used Coupang.
No shipping fee for purchases over a certain amount!
Wouldn't Coupang be like that too?
Rocket Fresh can only be delivered if you purchase over 15,000 won~
Ahhh, right, right, that's right. Coupang also has membership...? Doesn't it have something like that?
My mom said that because of that, she got everything shipped for free and got it quickly.
Oh wow? Rocket Wow member? Is that so...
That's right~ If you pay 2900 won a month, you can become a member and get free rocket delivery Kiki
I feel like a public relations ambassador~
Kiki, are you a Coupang employee?
But it's all correct information Kiki
Have you seen the drama My Mister? The one with IU in it!
I don't know because I only watch it sporadically~
Oh my god, I really got hooked and watched it straight through ㅠㅠ
I'm still watching it in clips these days ㅠㅠ It's really a masterpiece
Right ㅠㅠ Seriously, you have to watch this, sis... It's the drama of your life ㅠㅠ
I have to see you again soon
It's been appearing briefly on tvN these days~
I think it's a collection of only touching scenes
No, that drama also had a lot of swearing at first, saying it was a love line between an older person and a younger person.
Yeah, that's right... People who see everything as a love line ㅠㅠ
I really hated Jang Ki-yong when I watched it, but it was okay when I watched it till the end.
Jang Ki-yong was scary from the beginning, so what? I thought~ but there was a story~
I first saw the actor Jang Ki-yong in that drama, and when he appeared in a romance drama later, my friends kept saying he was cool, but I was a little scared.
I guess my uncle had a big impact
Kiki, I guess so. You look cool in other places...
Is there another drama you enjoyed watching?
www was also fun because it had Jang Ki-yong in it~
These days, it's fun to see Kim Seon-ho appear in the show &quot;Geatbawi Chachacha&quot;~
Oh right, WWW was famous, I didn't see it though ㅠㅠ
Did you see your sister?
I haven't seen it either! I heard it was fun, but...
Were you talking about Naver?
It was exactly like the story about Naver and Daum~
Is the motif really Naver and Daum?
Oh, that's the kind of content it was. They said that Da-hee Lee was also really pretty in it. Some women said their hearts fluttered.
I heard that, but I'm not sure either Kiki
That's right, Dahee Lee and Soojung Lim! They're all pretty.
But there is definitely a difference in length, they are both pretty though~
Oh Hong, isn't Dahee Lee really tall? Is Soojung Lim on the petite side?
Im Soo-jung is petite... but I think Lee Da-hee is a lot taller than I thought?
Since she was a model, she must be really tall~
But it's so skinny wow
Have you seen Mr. Sunshine? It's the drama of my life...
There were a lot of people like that! I stopped watching it after watching it for a bit...
Should I take note of it?
I haven't seen it either~ I don't like Lee Byung-hun
I'm curious about what it's about~
Aaaah no no I didn't watch it because of Lee Byung Hun but I really have to watch this
This is seriously a work of art ㅠㅠ
Do you often read webtoons or comics?
I don't read webtoons, but I like comics like Conan and Crayon Shin-chan Slam Dunk. What about you?
On the contrary, I don't read comics and I read a lot of webtoons. Kiki
I can't watch it these days because of exams, but I plan to watch it all once I'm done.
Kiki I don't see either of them~
When I was in middle school, I occasionally borrowed comic books to read, but there weren't that many...
Are webtoons fun?
Which author do you like?
Do you have a favorite webtoon?
The artist who drew Yumi's cells is Lee Dong-gun. His character is really cute and his emotional lines are so detailed that you might think he's really a woman!
It's fun and there are new releases out now!
Ah, Yumi's cells! I've heard of them~
It's so famous that I think it's going to be made into a movie or drama? Kim Go-eun is the main character.
Is that right, drama Yana? There was a trailer for it~
Yeah, that's right, that's right. I heard that the webtoon was so popular that they're making it into a drama...
But personally, I don't think a drama based on a webtoon would be that interesting, so I'm not really looking forward to it.
Yeah, I think I said before that Cheese in the Trap wasn't that good either.
Both the drama and the movie are weird ㅠㅠ The content is okay though~
Yes, I remember it was made into a drama but it didn't get good reviews so it was made into a movie too, which was even worse. Kiki
I think this little bit of cohabitation went well this time?
Oh, that thing with Jang Ki-yong and Hye-ri? Is that a gumiho story...?
Oh really? I only saw it from the front~
Yeah, that's right, that's right, Jang Ki-yong is here too, that's right, Kiki
Do you like Marvel movies?
It's fun to watch, but I'm not the type to watch it all the time! Do you like it?
I don't like it~ Everyone says it's fun so I'm trying to pull myself together and watch it, but I can't really see it~ ㅠㅠ
Kiki, my sister and I seem to have slightly different tastes
I watch a lot of Marvel movies ㅠ
It's fun to watch!
I want to see everything, but there are so many that I can't even think about it, so I can't keep up...
What do you find particularly interesting about Marvel?
I definitely go with Iron Man and the Avengers!
Ah, what's going on this time... It's a Marvel movie, but there's a Chinese? Asian? hero movie. I thought it was just a third-rate Chinese movie until I saw the Marvel logo haha
What was the title?
I wanted to see that call restriction thing, but I haven't seen it yet
Aha, I think that sending restriction is also a good thing.
Can you recommend some delicious restaurants in Suwon?
Then I've been here for 24 years Kiki
What do you like?
I like everything except mushroom food!
Oh really? Do you like mala-tang by any chance?
Of course I love Mala Tang
You were the one who initiated me!
There is a good mala-tang restaurant near Ajou University in Suwon.
Anywhere else than where we went?
Yeah, that's right, it's new, Kiki
Do you remember when we ate and had a stomachache so we took medicine?
We ordered it too spicy back then
The spicy soup place there is a bit spicy
Even when we were hungry
Wow, we were really crazy
They were crazy about Mara
What's delicious at the new place?
I ordered egg fried rice and it was delicious and chewy.
Wow, did you know that egg fried rice is the best when it's fried in a wok?
You know, it's really delicious Kiki
You said you wanted your furniture made of wood!
Yeah, that's right, wooden furniture is pretty~
So, what kind of home appliance do you want to buy?
When it comes to home appliances, it's Samsung Kiki
When it comes to home appliances, isn't it LG?
No, Samsung washing machines look really good these days.
As expected, big companies are different!
I also want to buy a microwave oven ㅠ
But anyway, aren't dryers hot these days?
Oh yeah, the dryer was awesome
But that will ruin the fabric
Oh my? I go to a coin laundromat and turn on the dryer every week?
If you turn it often, it will get fluffy quickly and it's not good.
So that's why all my winter knits are damaged ㅜㅜ
Yes, if possible, you should avoid using the dryer.
But when I put towels in the dryer, they become so fluffy that I can't help but do it ㅜㅜ
I think a towel would be okay
Have you tried KTX?
Yeah, I rode it when I went to Busan this time~
Did you take the train from Suwon to Busan?
Yeah, that's right, I went to a room in Suwon.
Then how many hours does it take to get there?
I think it took about two and a half hours from Suwon
Wow, that's really fast. How much does it cost?
It costs about 80,000 won round trip, but I got a discount~
Wow, that's really expensive. How did you get a discount?
I bought a pass called Tomorrow on Korail Talk
Please tell me how to cancel that pass too!
You can choose to buy a 3-day or 7-day pass for tomorrow.
I see. How much does that cost?
A 3-day pass is 50,000 won and a 7-day pass is 70,000 won. Kiki, that's okay.
Then you must have bought a 50,000 won note?
Yeah, that's right. It was good because it was cheap.
My work life is so hard these days.
How long has it been since you got a job, sister?
How old do you think I am?
Hasn't it been half a year?
6 months? Well, I've been going for 8 months now~
What? It hasn't even been a year yet and it's hard?
That's how all office workers are~
What did you say you were doing?
I'm working on my contract!
What is the shorthand doing?
First time hearing this
Um, I'll try searching on Naver. It's too much of a hassle to talk~
Okay, I see, I see.
Your back will hurt a lot.
Yes, this is also an occupational disease.
Everyone is just like me~
Sister, are you a full-time employee or a contract employee?
No, I'm a contract worker at our company~
I wish I could be converted to a full-time employee Kiki
Did your boyfriend get discharged from the army?
Yeah, that's right, I was discharged from the army when my term was up. Kiki
Wow, that's cool. Your boyfriend must have had a hard time!
Where did your sister's boyfriend come from?
My boyfriend is in the special forces~
Wow, that's cool.
Don't you have to be good at martial arts to do that?
Yeah, I just got assigned to it.
He's just an old man now.
Oh really? Kiki, but what special forces unit are you affiliated with?
I don't know, I'm not really curious Kiki
Guys really like to talk about the military. Does Kiki's boyfriend do that too?
My brother used to talk excitedly until he was in his mid-20s, but now he's a no-nonsense person and all he does is nag.
Yeah? My boyfriend is in his early 20s, so talking about the military is a must.
Oh, I really don't know why men are like that!
Every time I hear that, I get goosebumps
Don't listen to all that and change the subject to something else!
So every time that story comes up, I hold my mouth shut
Are you studying a foreign language?
Oh, I learned Spanish a little bit before.
Real? When did you learn Spanish?
I was bored during winter break, so I learned it while watching Netflix.
Hey, can you say hello in Spanish?
How about Ola Bueno Diaz? It feels a lot different from English.
Oh, I should greet you like that next time I see you!
Kiki, no, I'm sold out,
Sister, have you ever seen Money Heist on Netflix?
Was Paper House a Spanish drama?
Oh right, that's a Spanish drama, so it's good for learning conversation.
Honestly, I thought all the kids who spoke a foreign language spoke English Kiki
Besides English, there are also many in German, Japanese, and Chinese ^^
Yeah, I'm just stupid~
Ah, learn a little~ These days, it seems like learning three languages is the basics.
I can't even speak Korean so I'm going to be a zero-language person ㅜㅜ
Really? I guess I'll have to start learning Korean again.
Do you still go hiking with your little dad these days?
I'm coming down from the mountain right now anyway
Is this true? Where are you going to go this time?
I think it's in Gangwon-do, but I don't know much about it.
How many times a week do you come?
Go to work on weekdays and two days on the weekend?
What did you bring when you got the mask?
I'm dying from boredom without digging up ginseng or picking mushrooms.
Do I need permission to get that too?
My dad has a separate farm so he got Kiki's permission.
I see. That's strange. Even ginseng is expensive, costing millions of won!
Yeah, that's true, right?
But Kiki is not doing well these days
So what are you selling these days?
These days, I pick peaches and share them with people around me.
Oh, really? It's peaches season these days!
Yeah, that's right, it rained a lot so there was a lot Kiki
It's my 7th anniversary in October and I'm having trouble deciding what to give as a gift.
Um, oppa, since you're older, how about a belt?
Belt I bought an Agatha belt a while ago.
Oh really? Let's get you something more expensive!
Agatha belt not so good?
Somehow it never got cold.
Wow, but you still gave me a gift? ㅜㅜ That's too much
So he said he didn't wear it because he didn't have any clothes that matched it!
Oh, that's too much~ Then should I buy you a luxury belt to look good?
How much does a Gucci belt cost?
Well, maybe around 70?
I'm not sure about the belt Kiki
I'm thinking about Maginot Line 50 right now!
If you're 50, then a tie would probably be okay Kiki
My brother works on a temporary contract so he wears running clothes a lot ㅜㅜ
Well, what about your wallet?
I changed your wallet last year too ㅜㅜ
Wow, you're really amazing, sis~
So what kind of cat do you want to raise?
I'm thinking of taking in a stray cat and adopting it.
The kids from the streets are pretty, like our Ohbok~
I want to raise an abandoned cat rather than a purebred cat ㅠㅠ I feel bad for it too
If your cousin's cat has kittens, don't you plan on taking them in to raise them?
Wow, this is totally great~
Mongsil is pretty too haha
What is the name of the breed Mongsil?
Maine Coon grows up to 1m tall.
That's right, I always forget
When I see him, I think of Gugucon Kiki
Why do I think of Gugucon?
The baby's fur is the color of a googocon!
Ah, the pattern is a bit like that, Kiki
Yeah, it's totally cute
I recently had a baby, what happened?
The babies went to heaven because of vinegar ㅠㅠ
Oh my gosh, that's what happened. My heart hurts so much ㅜㅜ
I hope you give birth healthily next time ㅠㅠ
You don't like camping?
I like camping, but isn't it too much of a hassle?
You are my subject too
i think so too!
How about a fully equipped caravan?
Have you ever been caravan camping?
Yeah, I went in the spring and it was better than I expected.
Wow, I've been to Taean, where have you been?
I went to Ganghwa Island Kiki
Where is Ganghwa Island located?
It was next to Incheon, it almost felt like an island Kiki
Then the view would have been an ocean view?
It was close to the ocean but had a mountain view.
That's a shame
Then there must have been a lot of mosquitoes and flies?
I guess it's because it's at the bottom of a mountain, but there's also a mosquito net!
That should be a given~
What about the amount?
It's the off-season so it's cheap at 100,000 won
Which Overwatch character is your favorite?
I'm a diva and a bombshell
Wasn't she a female character? You don't use male characters?
Yeah that's right, female character uses McCree, male character uses McCree
Then, when you see it, is there a character you would recommend that suits me?
My sister likes aiming, so I think a sniper widow would be good
What's the aim? Is Widow a female character?
A female character who can accurately hit the target in one shot!
I see. How many minutes does one game take?
It's a capture game so I think it takes about 20 minutes
That takes as long as the bag!
Yeah, it's similar to LoL, Kiki takes a while
I see. Was there a change of heart for that too?
I think team play is more important than individual play, Kiki
Isn't that just a land grab game in the end?
Yeah, I think so too, Kiki, it's fun
How much did you take with you when you traveled to Europe?
I think it was around 500
So the total travel expenses are 5 million won?
Yeah that's right but I think it got stolen in the middle so I think it cost an extra 100 or so
How did it get stolen ㅜㅜ
A robber stole my bag while I was sleeping.
But you're not hurt, right?
Yeah, I'm glad your limbs are fine.
Did you run away with all your luggage?
No, I just ran away with my important backpack.
What was in there?
Passport, money, camera, AirPods, etc. ㅠㅠ
You ran off with only the most expensive thing. What about the cell phone?
Kiki was holding the phone tightly in her hand
What would I do if I didn't even have a cell phone? ㅜㅜ
Am I really an international missing person?
You said you don't like the cold?
Yeah, that's right. I hate the cold. The weather is getting colder these days.
That's right, I don't even turn on the air conditioner much anymore ㅜㅜ
Our house air conditioner already has a cover on it Kiki
Really? You put it on that quickly?
How is it there, the wind blows so hard at night?
You know, here, there's a window right outside the window.
Oh, then it will be warm when it's cold~
I don't think so, the sunlight isn't coming in ㅜㅜ
That would be a bit uncomfortable ㅠㅠ There needs to be sunlight
The good thing though is that it's dark so you can sleep in!
That's why I wake up early because the sunlight is so good
Are you thinking of buying blackout curtains?
Even with the blackout curtains, it comes in through... like this
Your house doesn't have time for mold Kiki
That's right, Kiki's house is very fluffy
Did you see the letter Kang Ho-sun sent this time?
Huh? What letter? This is the first time I've heard of it.
He said he requested personal protection because his prison guards were making his life miserable!
Hey, you want personal protection for a criminal? That's really ridiculous.
There was already something like that in the comments
You should be thankful that you are still alive.
We think so
But I guess he doesn't think that way.
By the way, when is Kang Ho-soon going to be released? He's scary.
As far as I know, he is serving a death sentence!
It may not be the death penalty, but it would be life imprisonment.
Of course, since we have abolished the death penalty!
I hope I never get out of prison, I'm scared
He also said that he killed a total of 10 people!
This is really creepy. How did he get caught?
Well? I'm not sure about that!
Oh really? Still, I'm glad I caught that demon.
Do you know the famous prophet in India?
I think I've heard of it before, but why?
Right! He predicted Corona.
Yeah, that's right. But why?
But this time he made another prophecy!
Oh really? What kind of prophecy is this?
They say that Corona will last for about 3 years!
It's so horrible, I want it to end quickly, but Corona
But he predicted that starting next year, we will be able to live without masks!
Isn't that perhaps a declaration of coexistence?
It's still a while before Corona disappears...
That's right, and there's going to be a boom in the '23s!
Oh really...? A boom? Isn't that a good thing??
So I guess we need to gather our stocks!
Ah, stocks! I don't have money to buy stocks ㅠㅠ
But since it's what the prophet said, isn't it worth investing in?
Sister, isn't that a scam? Be careful...
Have you ever been to a dermatologist?
Yeah, I went to get my mole removed recently.
Oh really? How many dots did you take off?
I took out about 3 deep ones
Shouldn't the deep ones be cut out?
Yeah, it was really strong and it was hit hard with a laser.
Did that smell like burning meat?
Yeah I thought you were grilling squid Kiki
I know that too
I'm also a dot-headed person Kiki
Sister, did you remove all the spots?
No, I also got a deep one and it came out again, so I just lived with it.
Wow, that would be stressful too ㅠㅠ
It's okay. When I was little, I only had dots on my face, but now I have them like dots!
Hmm, I guess I achieved a mental victory?
Could you please stop talking like that?
Am I really okay?
Yeah, good luck to you, unnie!
Have you ever been to a gym and gotten a personal trainer?
Yeah I got it for a bit last year Kiki
Wow, how many months have you been going?
I did it for about 4 months and then I gave up Kiki
4 months is still a long time
But why did you quit?
Yeah but I'm losing interest so I won't go anymore
But do you admit that losing weight is the hardest?
Yeah, I can't resist something so delicious, Kiki
How much did the PT cost there?
I was hesitant because 450,000 won for 10 times was too expensive.
Are you only going to do it for an hour there?
It takes about an hour, but it feels like 50 minutes.
People usually say that one hour feels like ten because it's hard, but you're the opposite.
No, there are breaks in between~
Well, if I had done it for an hour without stopping, I would have died.
Kiki, that's what Teacher Piti did while gently coaxing you.
Do you trade stocks?
I lost money while trading stocks because I was so annoyed
Wow, where did you invest and quit?
I put it in the summer theme stocks to make a short-term investment.
You're actually good at using stock terminology, aren't you?
I learned a little bit on YouTube, but I'm still a beginner~
Have you thought about investing again?
Yeah but I think I need money so no no right now ㅠㅠ
How much did you invest when you invested in stocks?
I put in 100,000 won of my real allowance and got 5,000 won Kiki
But it wasn't a minus, was it? Isn't it a good thing?
I also experienced some minuses in the middle. It was really dizzying.
How much did it drop into the red?
I started crying when it went down to about 2,000 won.
But the amount is small, so if you put in a few balls, you'll probably cry.
Then I really feel like I wouldn't be in this world...
What songs are you listening to these days?
I'm listening to Peaches from Pishik University these days
Are you still listening to it?
Have you heard of Kiki? The cover of Pishik University is so addictive.
I also heard that and was like, what is this? I started listening to it every morning Kiki
Aren't the old men's pronunciations so cute?
Yeah this is the best Justin Bieber song cover ever!
Kiki, you probably got a lot of views on YouTube too
Really? How many times was it filmed?
I think it was a few million, Kiki
Comments are still coming in
I know I played a part in that too!
That's right, our brothers, please stream a lot~ ^^
Of course you didn't release any other songs besides Peaches?
There's also Havana, listen up.
I feel like I'm in Cuba Kiki
Kiki Havana isn't that Camila song I know, is it?
That's right, Havana is warming up~
There's a video you often watch while eating, right?
I'm watching Peninsula on Netflix these days
Is Peninsula the sequel to Train to Busan?
Oh really? I don't know for sure, but it seems similar because it's a zombie movie.
My love Kang Dong-won is in Kiki
Wow, Kang Dong-won is really handsome.
That's right, what is my love Kang Dong Won's role?
Kiki, it was cool that you saved people from zombies
As expected, my love Kang Dong-won. Who else is the actor?
I think Kim Sun-ah was in it, she's still beautiful
Are you talking about Kim Sun-ah from Kim Sam-soon that I know?
Yeah, that's right. Does Kiki know that drama too?
Of course, it's probably a 20 year old drama?
Wow, it's really been a long time. Even Kiki and Kim Sun-ah don't age.
As expected, celebrities are different. Who is the director?
I don't remember the director very well. I think he was a newbie.
Pasta Story is cheap and good, right?
Seriously! It's worth going if you're sick of buffets haha
Kiki, ugh, it was delicious, there were a lot of people
Yeah, but the store is small so I don't think there's as much as I thought, but maybe it's because it rained. If it didn't rain, there would be more!
Yes, the store is smaller than I thought, Kiki
Today, the cream sauce was delicious, so I wanted to keep eating it. Just the sauce.
Kiki, I thought you were eating soup
Let's eat pizza later!
Right, let's eat some rice together later!
I feel like I'm full because I didn't eat enough food Kiki
Yeah, that's right. If you eat Western food, it's a bit like that Kiki
Next time I go, I'll order pizza and rice and eat there too
Kiki woong woong good job adding sheep
If I hadn't done it, I would have been really hungry by 3 o'clock?
Okay okay right now I already feel like something is off
I was really full earlier, but when I came back after brushing my teeth, I felt a bit fuller. Kiki
Kiki, what do you want to eat for dinner? ^^
Kiki I'm going home to eat japchae and bulgogi~ Hehe
Wow! I'm not jealous because you eat bulgogi often~ ^^
**Ah, let's go to the convenience store...
**Hey, are you really going to eat alone?
Sister, what do we want to eat... Should we buy ice cream?
Kiki, weren't you asking what to eat for dinner?
Ice cream is a snack~
Eat seaweed and ice cream!
I don't want to eat ice cream, Merong~
Actually I want to eat it now Kiki
I was thinking about it earlier and decided not to eat it, but if you still want to eat it, then eat it!
So you said you wanted to eat, and now you're talking about what you want to eat. Kiki, go out and eat!
Yeah, I'll go with you, Kiki
But I'm sleepy for the first time in a while after eating
Kiki-sister too? I also have that same feeling. Is it because I feel uneasy?
I went to bed early at 10 last night, but I had a hard time waking up in the morning, but I didn't fall asleep!
Yeah, really? I'm so sleepy Kiki
If you're really sleepy, you should drink some coffee for the first time in a while~
Kiki, I should take some out and drink it too.
Sister, you said you were going to buy a bed, right? Why are you buying it all of a sudden?
I'm running out of storage space! Kiki
So I bought one with a lot of space underneath to store things.
Yeah, I have storage space under my bed too, and I really like it! Recommended Recommended
Oh, so there's a bed right now?
Did you bring it from your home?
No, for now, just put down a mattress and use it!
I didn't bring anything from home haha
But these days, if you look at most things, they all have basic storage space.
So you're going to just put the mattress on the bed and use it?
Woof woof carrot! I'm just buying the frame!
I don't want to have too much luggage later, so I bought something simple made of iron.
Have you already bought it? Or are you ordering it now?
I feel alive now!
What color do you want to buy?
I wanted to buy white, but when I looked for something sturdy, the only one with good reviews was black. So I bought black.
But come to think of it, how do you receive that when your house is empty on a weekday?
Wow, this is the first time I've heard of a black bed
Sister, aren't you going to regret it again like the black keyboard...?
Kiki, have you never seen a steel frame?
The steel frame is mostly black!
I don't know what you're talking about either, I'm curious!
Oh, so you're buying the iron frame because you don't want to move it around too heavily later?
Yeah, that folding and unfolding thing is the number one seller on Amazon, right?
I live by faith Kiki
Kiki, I'll let you know later, I'll flex my salary
Oh, it's easy. You don't even have to assemble it. Just fold and unfold it?
Yeah, I see. Is that so?
But I was a bit surprised because there were so many reviews saying it was sturdy. Kiki isn't that expensive!
How much are you thinking about?
It doesn't seem that expensive because it's just made of iron. I think it costs around 30,000 to 40,000 won.
It was much less than I thought Kiki
I think I can buy it for around 100,000 won?
Is it okay to just buy the Kiki frame? It's good.
But isn't the subway really noisy? I think the noise from the subway running is a bit loud.
Oh, I felt it too. It gets worse in certain areas... That's why I don't talk on the phone on the subway.
Kiki, that's right, it's really bad when you go from Bangbae to Sadang Station
I can't even hear what my sister is saying
Yeah, once in a while, there's a section so it's too noisy
In that case, the bus is better...
Seriously Kiki, we always talk right up to your ear there...
It was really noisy
Kiki, that's right, but it's raining a lot today so the buses will be really congested
Study and go ^^
Kiki, but I'm really stuck...
It's raining so I'm studying and I'm going to be late so I'll probably get stuck~ Kiki
I can see your will to go ^^
Ah ** I rode line 4 last time Kiki
When did you ride Line 4? Tell me your review Kiki
Guys, they're building a Line 4 station in front of my house! It's awesome.
I originally got on at Danggogae, the final stop, but it continues!
Line 4 is rotten... haha... wow Kiki is awesome!
When will it be completed
Kiki Yool Then I can just ride it all the way to my neighborhood haha
Kiki is too far away~
It's supposed to be completed by the end of this year, but it's been five years since that was mentioned, and finally...
Oh congratulations Kiki I went there on Line 4, Isu Station!
Kiki Oh, I often go to Isu Let's meet at Isu from now on! Kiki
Where is Kiki Isu...
Do you feel like you're too far away from me? Kiki
Oing **isn't this good for you Kiki
But it's not far from my house
Kiki, that's right, it's close to my house
How long does it take you two to get there?
I looked it up and it seems like it's not that far, with Line 7 taking 1 hour and 8 minutes and Line 4 taking 1 hour and 14 minutes!
Uh... How far? Kiki, I'll be around 30 minutes?
Kiki, if we're going to meet up later, Gangnam would be the best place, right?
It takes about the same time as Gangnam, Kiki
You know, Gyeonggi-do residents say an hour is fine, and an hour and a half is a bit long.
People in Seoul say it's far away in an hour.
Akiki-chan, you're funny. Are you saying I'm from Seoul? Haha
Kiki Yole Pro Seouler~ Take us on a Seoul tour
I think the people you work with are really important when you're working at a company!
Nana, you're thinking and talking about us, right? Haha, isn't it funny?!
Kiki: So what is company life like now?
Yes, I'm having so much fun at work with my sisters ^^
Kiki, aren't you becoming more and more childish these days?
Kiki, that's right, honestly, you guys are like middle school friends, not even high school students. I like you guys ^^
I'm not like that normally, but when I'm with my sisters, I act like an elementary school kid.
That's why the group atmosphere is important~ Kiki
Seriously Kiki guys I really do... but don't your wrists hurt?
When you move your mouse!
It hurts ㅠㅠ I guess it's because I keep clicking all day. I really need to stretch my hands often.
Really? I'm not in any pain!
But it could be because the mouse is different
** My sister's mouse click sound is really loud...
Kiki, you're right, I can hear you here too, if you're a little quiet
When I click the mouse and turn my wrist, it makes a really loud clicking sound.
Kiki, oh right, I didn't know mine was that big
I knew it when I saw that it was completely silent when my sister next to me used it.
Yeah, mine doesn't make any noise either
Last Friday, when the three of us were studying alone, it was so quiet that ** sister was bothered by the sound of the mouse clicking. Kiki
Kiki I thought mine was a bit big too, **this mouse is a bit big!
Are you guys up to speed now?
Yeah, I'm currently refining the drama, and the content is continuous and fun, so I like it!
I can work now too~
The content is so ridiculous, but it's still fun because it continues. Kiki
I don't understand a single thing right now Kiki
I've done close to 900 so far and I'm just doing it...
I can hear my heart. I didn't know this from the title, but I think I know what drama it is because I hear Hwang Jung-eum and Kim Jae-won's voices. Kiki
Kiki I did that when I was an intern at Kkondae. I didn't know the content and it ended. Kiki
I think I've heard it before, but Hwang Jung-eum is a regular in Kiki's dramas
I also did a drama with Hwang Jung-eum, Kiki
There really are a lot of dramas out there...
When you work, your voice will pop out and you can tell right away
Yeah Kiki and I've never seen this before but I thought it was famous a long time ago so I knew right away that Nam Goong Min is in it! You know?
Yeah your voice is really great Kiki no I don't know Kiki
Hmm, I don't know either ㅠㅠ
I'll let you know when I find out more info haha
I think the Army, Navy, and Air Force uniforms are all really cool!
Oh right Kiki! Your uniform is really cool. Do you know anyone who was in the Marines? Kiki
I don't think any of my close friends are Marines! Kiki
Do you have a lot of friends in the Marine Corps?
I've never seen a Marine either!
Oh really? There were quite a few Kiki around me.
I get annoyed when I drink. Phew!
Kiki, tell me the Marine Corps story? Tell me a story you remember.
Really? Now that I think about it, it's strange. How is there not a single person around?
I used to say the same thing every time I got drunk, but now I can't even remember it Kiki
I think it was even noisier because we went and came back together with our classmates.
I think I heard that there are a lot more thugs than you think when it comes to talking about the military around here. Kiki
I gathered all the really weird people together, so there's bound to be a lot of weirdos... ㅜㅜ
Oh, come to think of it, I think my boyfriend said he was a Marine too, right? Isn't it Kiki?
Kiki, do you have a boyfriend now? Pay attention to your boyfriend!
Kiki, your boyfriend is in the Marines now? I should tell him that I don't remember~
No I just asked Kiki Kiki is so funny
Kiki's closest aide was there. Ask him what he thought of her visit. Kiki
Oh, cool, you're seeing a cool guy~
I heard that you ate a lot there before... You forced yourself to eat a lot of something
Wow, really? Are you crazy? What the heck is this? Seriously...
In that incident where someone died from being bullied in the military before, they forced him to eat frozen food and he died. ㅜㅜ
There are so many kids with really bad character...
Yeah, yeah ㅠㅠ If there are really skinny kids, I make them do a lot of push-ups on purpose.
But this was kind of funny. Isn't it supposed to help you build your body?
There are a lot of people who actually died, so these days, if you do something like that, you get reported right away. That's fortunate.
Kiki, you're giving me a body
But I think I would hate it even more if someone forced me to do it~
Yeah, that's just something I heard...
Anyway, there are so many things that don't seem human ㅠㅠ
That's right, let's give a round of applause to my sister's boyfriend who went to the Marines!
When I was in school, I really liked arts and physical education classes. Do your older sisters agree?
Haha, that's right, it's better because it's a mobile class
Kiki woong woong I was like let's go out during gym class what about you guys?
Of course I didn't want to go out. Kiki MBTI was the kid in front.
I don't want to go out either... I liked it the most when it rained during gym class.
Kiki, is it really true that MBTI is like this?
How is that? It's more fun if you go outside! Right?
Yeah, but it's annoying Kiki
And I hated having to change clothes during gym class
Admit it? I wasted all my precious free time changing clothes.
Kiki, that's right, I wear gym clothes all the time, they're comfortable, but I still don't like going out...
Kiki But I also wear gym clothes often
And since it's a girls' school, I can still wear it without it getting wet
Oh my ** You said you were going to an all-girls high school!? You went to an engineering middle school?
I envy you at girls' high school! I majored in engineering, but I was almost at the level of girls' high school Kiki
Kiki, woong woong girls' high school! But the playground was shared with the foreign language high school next door, and come to think of it, my current boyfriend went there Kiki
Wow, that's amazing. It must be fate!
Yeah, really! That's amazing haha. We didn't know each other back then?
Kiki Woong Woong I didn't know that back then, thank goodness ^^
But were you two good at art?
Kiki did a good job, it could just be my opinion though ^^
Kiki, I think I did pretty well in elementary school...
Kiki I also went to art school, but I think I went there to listen to the art teacher tell horror stories.
Kiki, I also went to an art school. My mom told me that I was good at it, so she sent me to art school...
I was ruined when I colored you know what Kiki
Oh, everyone went to art school. I didn't go. ㅠㅠ
But I went there with a friend and became close with that teacher, so we went there to hang out every day...
Kiki I think I'd rather make something with something like Hanji than draw like that.
Yes, it's ruined if you color it. It was fun making Kiki too~
I finished elementary school right away haha
I don't think I was very interested after that
Kiki, I guess I should learn art again while I'm at it.
Sisters, do you have a group chat with your family?
When I create a group chat, it disappears, and when I create it, it disappears Kiki
We don't use group chats haha it only happens when I make an announcement!
Kiki I know what it is I have it too but other than the words I need to say there is no activity at all Kiki
Kiki, you know what it is Kiki, we have them too, but we don't do anything except when necessary.
But there are quite a few houses that secretly have active family group chats!
Kiki, that's right. There are a lot of houses like that. First of all, not my house. My house is mostly called.
Yes, we also usually talk on the phone and even if it's not something important, we get ignored.
Kiki, that's right, I used to do that too...
And my mom and dad keep replying to my private messages when I talk in the group chat.
So cute, really
Kiki My dad says the most to me on text: Call dad. It's just like this.
Kiki, why are you all so cute...
No, why are you replying to my texts through Gantalk? Why are you sending me a KakaoTalk message telling me to call you when you could have just called me first? Kiki
Kiki I don't know, I think that would be much more uncomfortable, but even if I tell you every day, you don't respond and come to the chatroom Kiki
Kiki, let's each tell each other about your sister and brother's strengths! ^^
Why are you suddenly talking about your brother's good points like that? Kiki
I really question whether Kiki has any real merits...
It takes too much thought
Kiki, this is what you say in such a situation. Tell me one thing quickly and forcefully.
They celebrate anniversaries well...
No, but my sister said she didn't want to buy personal color because it was expensive and it was a waste of money, so I don't feel like praising her. Kiki
Our mother's sons and daughters have no strengths, that's their strength!
Kiki, you're both so funny Kiki
Then tell me when you really want to hit me
He's so absurd, he's asking for an interview and he's his only child!
I want to hit you when you act selfishly.
Seriously, Kiki, my sister hates hair so much that she always brushes it off.
I'm dying from annoyance, but you keep telling me to come out here and there. I hate it...
Isn't it totally great? Kiki
But seriously, how come so much hair falls out?
No, it's okay to tell someone to come out even though I'm not telling them to. At least Kiki
No, I even order you to do it. Just clean it up and clean it up and clean it up again. I can't tolerate even a single bit of Kiki...
Hey, you have to experience it to know Kiki
Kiki Unnie, but I think it would look better because your hair is thick
If you have a child later, do you want to have a daughter or a son?
Definitely a daughter! As for a son, just looking at my brother...
I am a son! I wish Kiki, a good son, would help me.
Kiki, you want to use your son! I want to have a daughter too haha
**This dream is big! Haha
But in this day and age, I don't want to let go of my daughter... ^^ I'm anxious
Kiki Actually, either a son or a daughter is best, but which one do you think should come first?
Yeah, I'm anxious... The world is so scary
Yes, I also want to have a son and a daughter, but I think it's better to have a daughter as the first child.
If the first child is a son, they beat him a lot...
If I had to choose, it would be my son!
I have to tell my son to raise himself well so he can protect his younger sibling haha
Kiki, the two of you are completely different
Yeah, but I also had a bit of a romantic idea about my older brother. He seemed like he would protect me somehow...?
Everyone has big dreams. I wish they could be realized through education... Kiki
But since it's a hit or miss anyway, I absolutely absolutely don't want two sons.
Kiki But I didn't have any expectations for my son in the first place...
Just looking at my friends around me or my son... I wish my children were not born into this harsh world.
Kiki, that's right, but these days, there are a lot of houses where two people live together and travel together.
There's a name for that, what is it? What kind of tribe is it?
I said it last time, but I didn't remember, so I looked it up and it's Kiki DINK.
Kiki, that's right, I know a DINK, and my older sister is married. The two of them always travel and go camping together. They're so sweet.
That's right, that's right, DINKs! That's the correct answer.
That's why I want to enjoy the first 3 to 5 years of marriage and then have a baby. ㅜㅜ
I also have my own dream! Then, if I want to have a baby, I can have another baby haha
Kiki, it's hard for me to live alone, but I'm really amazed at how you take care of a baby and live like that.
Yes, parents are really great! Let's do our best!
Kiki, that's right, but I've always heard people say that I'll get married early and raise my children well...
But the kids who said that are getting married first... ^^
Kiki, oh no, Kiki, unnie, but I think she'll raise the baby well
If Kiki has a child, the number of people who make her angry will increase from two to three.
Kiki, phew... what can I do! If you gave birth to a child, you have to take responsibility for it~
Kiki Yeah! I'll think about it after I get married.
I saw someone walking around the neighborhood with an alpaca leash the other day.
But I looked a little strange...
Why why? Alpacas are really cute ㅠㅠ
Kiki Really? An alpaca on a leash?
Isn't this something you wouldn't see even in a zoo?
Kiki, so it's not common to raise an alpaca, so when that person brings one out, people flock to take pictures and it's chaos.
I felt like I was enjoying it so I was a bit like that ㅜㅜ
I raised it because I wanted to get attention...
Oh, that could really be true ㅠㅠ
But is it okay for an alpaca to walk around with a leash like that?
I don't know anything at all. I saw a couple raising alpacas on TV before... haha
So I think I'd be really surprised
And wouldn't it be difficult to raise them if you don't live in a house with a yard? ㅠㅠ
So I don't know if it's okay to go like that!
Yeah, it's really big, so I think it would be difficult to live in a house without a yard.
But I think the people who appeared on TV were also raised in apartments.
Kiki, no, I think it smells ㅠㅠ How do you manage it?
Wow, I feel so bad for the alpaca in the apartment ㅜㅜ
That's right, the bigger the smell, the more it comes out.
By the way, have you seen the newborn alpaca? Kiki
They're really hairy guys...
It's so thin it's disgusting... Thin and long
And how do you dispose of that poop...?
Kiki, no, I haven't seen it
Are you born hairless?
The poop guy has to clean it up... Kiki
Yeah, no fur Kiki
It's raised by someone who can handle that kind of thing!
I saw it somewhere last time, and it seems like there are various methods for raising a puppy~
If they communicate with their owners from a young age, there won't be any big problems, right?
Kiki I want to raise a dog, but on the other hand, I think it would be too sad to think about it dying ㅠㅠ
Yeah, that's why I can't raise him either
I know that he has a shorter lifespan than me, but I raise him knowing that he will die before me.
It's obvious that it'll be too hard, so you shouldn't raise it from the beginning...
That's right ㅠㅠ And raising a pet is something that you have to be careful about and study a lot before raising it, so it's not something you can easily think about.
Yeah, I feel like crying all the time
I think I should really think about it later when I get married and settle down.
That's right, you have to raise them carefully and study hard ㅜㅜ
I told you that I hatched a chick in middle school.
The first time I brought him to my house, he died. Even though it had only been two days since I met him, I cried all day long.
I cried on the way to school and I cried all the time at school...
I think it was more like that when I was young ㅠㅠ
I also received a puppy and it died of parvovirus two weeks later. I cried for a long time.
I've never been to a pet shop since then
Oh really?... Look, it was such a short period of time, but it's so sad ㅠㅠ
I don't want to be heartbroken, sob, sob
Yeah, I can't because I'm sad ㅜㅜ
May everyone around me be healthy for the rest of their lives!
Okay, let's all live long and healthy! Haha
Kiki Guren, let's raise a pretty puppy later!
Has anyone tried paragliding!?
Oh no! I want to try haha
I want to try paragliding too! Kiki
It's scary but I think it'll be fun
It's something on my bucket list that I really want to do in my lifetime!
Oh, then let's go and try it together!
It's on my bucket list every year, but I haven't been able to go... haha
Is there a place Kiki wants to see?
People usually go to Danyang to go paragliding.
Yes, yes, I go to Danyang a lot.
You have to do it in a place where there are a lot of people and somewhere safe ㅜㅜ
But I'm still afraid of what might happen...
I only know Danyang! Haha
I did it in Korea and was planning to do it later when I go to Australia, but I couldn't do it last time because of Corona!
Kiki, that's right, they even pick you up in Danyang
But my friend says that driving up the hillside in a car is scarier than Kiki.
Wow, I guess that's true because you have to climb up high to do that.
What did friends who tried it say?
I feel like I can do really well right now, but I think it'll be scary when I actually go to Kiki.
I don't remember the review very well, but it was expensive and there were two versions
I've heard that there's a regular one and one that just spins in the air.
But I want to try it, but my boyfriend says he doesn't like that kind of thing and will never do it, he just goes with me...
If that's the case, then I won't go! ㅜㅜ
Kiki, then come with us!
My boyfriend also said he didn't want to go because he didn't want to do anything dangerous.
Oh really? Do you buy that a lot?
Yeah! Let's go together!
I don't know if there are many accidents, but just in case there's a problem with the wind or the machine, I'm afraid it might fall from the sky.
Yeah, I guess it's because it doesn't look safe at first glance?!
Kiki The funny thing is, we still do what we want to do Kiki
It would be nice if we went to experience it together
Kiki No... The three of us are the same, but ** Unnie will definitely not do it, so let's drag her along...
But surprisingly, ** might like that kind of thing!
I think they said they were doing something like that in Yeosu last time haha
Kiki, really? **She just hates hard things so if you tell her to go up by car, she'll probably go haha
Kiki, let's ask what you think about this and that. I just hate anything active.
Climbing is exercise... That's why I said no, Kiki.
Kiki, right? No, but I think you'll hate it if the feeling disappears
Do you like any mobile games?
I don't install games on my phone, so I sometimes play minigames that I don't install on KakaoTalk haha
That's also secretly fun
What is that? I've never heard of it before.
So I don't know, what is that?
If you go into that KakaoTalk app, there are games you can play without installing them.
There are quite a few people who don't know this...
I'll tell you later where to do it!
Wow, I really didn't know. What games are there?
Really? I didn't know that either.
How did you find out, sister?
There are so many Kiki games, but I play Tetris the most haha
I just did it because my friend told me to.
Kiki, is that a score that breaks your friend's record?
Oh, my friend, can we compete by floating the same thing?
Is it perfect for us? ^^
Yeah, I think you could find out your score if you did this with a friend on KakaoTalk, but I don't have any friends who do this these days, so I don't know ^^...
Kiki, really? Then I'll go break your sister's record. Wait.
That's right, you're stimulating our competitive spirit again. This can't be happening! Let's fight!
Oh, right! Jump in! Go into the KakaoTalk settings menu and go into games. There's a snack game that doesn't require installation.
Is this Kiki's Snack Game? The name is cute.
I came in as soon as I heard about it. I should give it a try hehe
Somehow he picked up his phone right away. Kiki is cute.
Try it later on your commute!
I eat Kiki first
Be prepared, be prepared
Kiki, this is fun. I'll do it properly later!
Kiki, I told you something fun again~ Thank you
This one was pretty good, Sister Kiki
Something to do when you're bored
Kiki, that's why it's a great game to play on your way to and from work.
What's this?! Kiki, I always tell you only good things **Ah!
Hmm? You don't remember very well?
What season do you like to travel the most?
Me right now! Haha I want to go backpacking!
Kiki I want to go in the fall
Kiki, it seems like you've never been there
Have you both ever been backpacking?
What's the difference between backpacking and regular travel?
Kiki, you're carrying a backpack
Give me a trip to Europe! Actually, Europe is still open for tourist visas haha
Backpacking is literally carrying a ton of luggage!
Kiki: So what do you all think about traveling alone?
I really want to travel alone these days! Kiki
Kiki, that's right, you said you wanted to go on a trip alone!
I want to try it myself too, but I'm a little scared Kiki
I'm scared of traveling alone too ㅜㅜ
There are also cases of people entering a residence with a master key and committing crimes.
I can't sleep alone after seeing that ㅜㅜ
I heard that there are a lot of people who target women who travel alone when I searched for tomorrow before...
That's what makes me scared, but I still think traveling alone would be great!
Wow, I think my friend went on a trip alone rather than something like that.
He said that when he went into the cafe, he was alone and everyone was looking at him because there were couples.
Kiki was so funny
Kiki that's funny
I would never do that either because of the risk.
When I was young, my parents were against me traveling alone, but now I understand why.
Kiki Uchiyama: That would be a bit lonely...
I'll take a tripod, take some pictures, and Kiki. Next time I go, I'll film a vlog and come back!
Kiki looks like it'll be fun
If you were to travel alone, where would you like to go?
Yes, my friend also enjoys traveling alone and went to Busan again. He goes there often.
I went to Jeju Island too, Kiki
Oh really? That's cool!
When I was young, I hated eating alone, so I never went alone. Kiki
Now that I can eat alone, I'll go when the coronavirus calms down a bit~
Where do you want to go most?
Kiki: When I was little, I couldn't eat alone either, but now I'm really good at it!
I don't have a place I particularly want to go. I originally planned to travel to Europe, but I won't be able to go for a while, so shouldn't I look for travel destinations within Korea?!
How about you go with us first?
Kiki ** Sister, you definitely want to go with me. Let's go together!
Kiki, decide when to go!
Then right after the exam, Lulu
It was really cold when I went home yesterday...
Yeah I was a little surprised Kiki so today I came with long sleeves!
That's right, fall has come now
It was so hot, but it changed in the meantime
So I got off the bus yesterday and I was really shaking...
So I brought an outerwear today too!
It was hot on the bus and subway ㅜㅜ
That's right, I ventilated the room in the morning and took a shower, but it felt like winter... ㅠㅠ
Kiki, right, I think it's time to put in a fan now
I usually turn on the fan when I dry my hair in the morning, but I didn't turn it on today.
Right, now I have to put the fan in and take out the electric blanket Kiki
Hey, if you turn it on, you'll catch a cold. Seriously, I don't have an electric blanket... ㅠㅠ
I have to steal it from Jinju!
Electric blanket is really a must-have, a must-have Kiki
I'm also planning to go to my grandmother's house for Chuseok this year and bring it up.
My grandmother bought it for me Kiki
Kiki is right, it's a must in winter
** Sister, what about the electric blanket you were using before? Are you replacing it with a new one?
Oh grandma, you're the best haha
**Did you throw this away when you moved?
Yol, you're right Kiki. That's old, so I only used it until last time and then just threw it away~!
Oh, good job. It's better to just throw that away, Kiki.
Grandma is really the best!
You didn't buy mine? Haha
Kiki, sorry, unnie, I think you should think about the electric blanket haha
What comes to mind first when you think of fall?
Fall leaves? Suddenly interview mode again Kiki
Kiki, let's do an interview!
I miss the fall foliage! Where are you guys going to see the fall foliage!
Kiki, good friends ㅠㅠ I don't think you've ever been to see autumn leaves
Where did you go to see the fall foliage?
Kiki I don't really like autumn leaves either... I just look at them in the neighborhood Kiki
I asked because I was reminded of Kiki Gunyang...
I don't think I've ever gone to see fall foliage?
But now that you mention it, I want to go to the mountains~
Kiki Well, it's perfect for this kind of weather
It's not that hot and it's cool
Yeah, but I don't really like mountains...
Really? Then I guess I have no choice but to take her hiking haha
Kiki we really have a lot to do
I should put that on the list soon
Have you seen the case of the rape and murder of a 20-month-old baby?
Am I seeing things wrong? Kiki
20 months? Isn't that crazy?
20 months...? Is this true...?
He is a real bug
I don't understand that sentence itself, Kiki
So now there's chaos. There's talk of chemical castration and people are saying that the death penalty should be revived because of this.
No, is that really a death sentence...?
This is really shocking. I just looked it up and it's real. Wow...
But I really hate seeing people doing politics in the midst of all this
What are you talking about? I'm vomiting since morning. What the hell is this? It's really annoying.
They even said that she wasn't the biological daughter of the man who committed the crime.
He said he did that because he thought she was his own daughter, but when the investigation into the case revealed that she was not his own daughter, he was surprised when he told the perpetrator about it.
No, if he were president, he would have executed him.
This just sounds like something he's saying to take advantage of his popularity...
It's all just so dirty, really ㅠㅠ Wow... It's shocking in itself
No, but it was creepy, I just saw it too, and after killing the baby, he texted his mother-in-law saying he wanted to do it again.
If you do it once, I'll tell you what the current situation is. It's really urgent to get the death penalty.
Yeah ** I really hate Kiki
Yeah, he said he asked his mother-in-law to do it once too. He's just a jerk
No... It's true that she's not your biological child, but it's really absurd to think that way about your own daughter.
Even if his mother said he was intellectually normal, he would have been like that
But doesn't he show his face?
Wow but it's definitely not a real-time search, so I don't think you'll know unless you look it up yourself ㅠㅠ
I think people don't know as much as they used to!
So I have to watch the news or read articles ㅜㅜ
We shouldn't let those kids out into society. Won't their faces be revealed soon?
Honestly, it's a really scary society for women to live in...
Even 20-month-olds are exposed to sexual crimes...
When I go home and see someone suspicious around my house, I don't go in right away but instead go around in circles before going in. That really makes me feel dizzy.
ㅠㅠ You did well, even if it's hard, you really have to do it like that
I wish he would kill the real example too
Yeah, it's so scary ㅜㅜ
Those kids are only strong towards those weaker than them. The fact that they are like that to that young and weak kid
That's right, how does the world really turn?
There are too many of those guys, like the teenage brothers who murdered their grandmother...
When I watch the real news, it's so amazing and scary to see that this kind of thing happens every day.
How can it be like this all the time? There's never been a single quiet day.
So, is that person who does autopsies scary? He has seen so many deaths.
He said that I should live my life thinking that even at this moment, it is a miracle that I am alive.
That's true ㅠㅠ
Those 10 brothers killed their grandmother because she kept nagging them...
Oh my... It's really going out, it's going out
Even people who do autopsies would be dumbfounded if they heard the reasons why people die.
Right... There was a case not long ago where someone killed his older sister because she nagged him.
Let's stop nagging at others and just live well ourselves...
**Hey... I won't nag you so much anymore...
**Ah, you apologize too, quickly ㅠㅠ
Kiki ha but I can't stop nagging... Hang in there guys... Fighting!
A bus crashed off a cliff while driving on a highway in Peru...
Wasn't there a guardrail next to it? ㅠㅠ
Were you driving while drowsy? Why did you fall?
I don't know, it seems like there is no guardrail ㅜㅜ
There was an accident in the Andes Mountains just a few days ago where a bus fell off a cliff and killed 16 people, and now they're saying it's a curse of traffic accidents.
No, I think the road needs to be cleared... What the heck, seriously ㅠㅠ
Oh my, if you keep doing that, it's really scary. I'm scared of where you're going.
That's right, isn't the road itself the problem? ㅜㅜ 29 people died this time...
A few days ago, 14 people died in a shipwreck in the Peruvian Amazon River, and a few months ago, 27 people died when a bus fell off a mountain road.
Seriously, isn't this the curse of Peru...
Huh? That's what happened in the last few months?
This is crazy, this is really the curse of Peru...
Peru, what kind of construction are they doing so carelessly? How can they do that?
So this is all just a short while... Peruvians must be scared
So bus drivers must be scared when they drive too ㅠㅠ...
Or maybe it's because the weather is not so good and I slipped or something ㅠㅠ
The article said that the passengers said they hit a rock while speeding.
Sister, you said you were scared because the bus was running so fast when you went home, Kiki
I really think speeding is dangerous
Oh, but that day was really scary, Kiki
Gyeongsang Province bus drivers really drive recklessly, don't they?
Even though I was used to it, I was scared that day
What? I don't think I heard it. Let me know.
Yes, I heard that Gyeongsang Province has a lot of reckless driving Kiki
** I said it in the idiot group chat!
Seriously **Ah, could you please pay some attention to me...? ^^
When I went home on Friday, the bus driver drove really fast.
I passed all the buses going to the dedicated road in front and went first...
It usually takes 8-10 minutes? But I got there in 5 that day.
Wow, you said this in the group chat? Wow, wow?
No, but the bus driver and the running driver really step on each other so it's very dangerous
But I have a hasty personality so I like running men Kiki
I feel like I'm saving time, but seeing things like that makes me feel dangerous ㅜㅜ
It's frustrating to run too slow, but Kiki has to be moderate...
This is my first time experiencing reckless driving in Seoul.
Kiki I also feel a bit uneasy when I ride the bus sometimes.
Oh my gosh, what crime did the people on that bus commit? Seriously ㅠㅠ
So I guess it's the instinct to run in the city, Kiki
Kiki, you're driving safely though, you're carrying other passengers...
Kiki, that's right, it's so bad that sometimes I want to say it.
I really love eyelash perms. It improves my quality of life~
I'm not doing it these days Kiki
I have to do it again right after the test is over~
Kiki, that's right, when I first did it, it was a whole new world
Has anyone ever gone to a shop and gotten it?
I have to do it after my exam too
There are so many new ones, I haven't tried them at Kiki's shop ㅜㅜ
I haven't tried it at a salon either, but I've had eyelash extensions done a lot in the past haha
Oh really? It's really long even without extensions, sis. Kiki
Tell me about the extension review
So, unnie, it's long even if you didn't extend it, so why did you do it?
Kiki, I was obsessed with eyelashes... ^^...
It's so comfortable and you don't have to wear any other makeup, right?
Kiki, don't do it too harshly, just do it in the most natural way
But the shop owner always asked me why I did that
Kiki No, I do it myself but it takes too long so I'm thinking of doing it at a shop!
I've heard a lot that my sister is obsessed with eyelashes, but she still gets perms~
Oh, it's faster and more convenient to go to the shop, but I like money!
I couldn't even think about getting a perm back then!
But isn't it nice that the eyes just look dark? Kiki
It's definitely different. I was thinking of extending it even though it was long, but now I'm frustrated and can't do it.
Kiki, if you go there, can you extend just the bottom?
If you extend it, will it definitely be more frustrating than if you didn't extend it?
Yeah, I feel like I've been pulling out one strand at a time while washing my hair...
I don't know because I haven't tried the lower part.
Oh, how much did you pay for it? I wonder
Kiki, that's right, I heard that you miss that a lot every day
I can't do it because I hate being stuffy.
I think it was around 30-40 thousand won?
I did it because it was the most natural!
Kiki Oh, it's okay. I'll go to the shop after my exams are over!
Oh but I'm scared that it might fail
Why are they always doing this? They're doing a good job haha
I don't feel like doing it myself, but I'll do it during the Chuseok holidays.
Hey, you guys all go to the shop and do it? Haha, I like it, I like it~
I want to go see it after Chuseok
Kiki, try Woong Woong and if it's better there, just go to the shop, otherwise do it yourself...
It's annoying, but I just said I'll do it during the Chuseok holiday Kiki
It's a waste of money because it doesn't last long ㅜㅜ
That's right Kiki
But when I look at my friends, they seem to go to the shop and do it much better and last longer.
Oh really? I'll go and come back and tell you a review Kiki
Do you have any habits or things you eat to stay healthy?
Hmm, these days I take apple cider vinegar pills on an empty stomach in the morning! Haha
What are apple cider vinegar pills?
When I first heard about Kiki, I knew a lot of interesting things
I also find it interesting that Kiki-sister eats a lot for her health.
Kiki I'm serious about my health Kiki
I just eat it like a vitamin and I like it because I also drink water in the morning.
What are apple cider vinegar pills good for?
I've seen people eat apple cider vinegar itself, but this is the first time I've seen it in pill form.
Seriously, can your body survive by eating that kind of food? Kiki
It's the same thing, but I hate eating vinegar as is, so I eat it made into a vitamin-like substance!
What do you guys have?
I eat probiotics and vitamin B
I get a sore tongue whenever I'm a little tired, so I heard that vitamin B is good for me?
I started taking Omega Three Kiki Vitamin C because I was sick a lot these days.
Oh eat impactamine ** I really like that haha
When the tongue bumps, it almost disappears immediately
Kiki Oh really? If I eat everything I'm eating now, I'll have to buy some.
I think I'm doing okay these days. Kiki isn't here.
Come to think of it, I also get colds a lot, but I'm feeling a bit better these days!
That's why regular life is really important Kiki
When I go to work, it's automatic!
Kiki, that's right. If I sleep in even a little late, I'll be tired the next day, so I have to go to bed before midnight somehow.
Yes, it is very important what time you go to bed.
If I sleep late, I'll be very sleepy the next day.
That's right, if you go to bed early you'll definitely feel refreshed the next day!
But I still feel like I'm wasting some of my time, so I feel like it's a waste to go to bed early ㅠㅠ
These days, it's just a real robot. It's like a robot's work, food, sleep, work, food, sleep... sad
But now, even if I go to bed early, I'm still sleepy the next day
I guess I'm so tired that I can't seem to get over it...
Why is that? ㅠㅠ Nana, don't you listen to meditation music when you sleep these days?
Isn't that because you didn't rest on the weekend?
I feel more rested on the weekends than I do on the weekends?
I was at home last weekend, except for going to the hospital ㅜㅜ
Yeah, I didn't even have time to do that these days, I just passed out
Meditation music is the best...
Thanks to that, I feel much better after sleeping a little bit these days? Kiki here and there while broadcasting
Kiki But looking at our lifestyle these days, we can faint even if we just close our eyes without meditation music
You know, every time the season changes, you wonder what you were wearing before?
I have to buy it again!
I really sympathize with you Kiki
I need to get some fall clothes sent from Jinju!
It got cold too quickly
Kiki, seriously, I haven't bought clothes in a long time so I have nothing to wear.
Do you usually shop online or go in person to buy?
Sister, please send it quickly Kiki
I buy a lot online!
I like both, but I think online is a bit more important. Kiki
Kiki guys I'm still stuck in the pants swamp
I can't even choose pants these days ㅠㅠ sigh
I think I can buy more carefully online because I can compare things and buy whenever I want.
** Sister, why are your pants like this ㅜㅜ
Yes, it seems that there are clear advantages and disadvantages to both online and offline!
**What kind of pants are you going to buy!
I want to buy bootcut jeans these days, but the fit is quite different for each bootcut.
If you think it's pretty and okay, it looks long to me ㅠㅠ Please help me
ㅜㅜ Haven't you found anything you like for short people?
Well, if you cut the boot cut, the fit will be weird...
Yeah but these days the quality of clothes is good and there are quite a few pretty ones haha
I'll see you later! Show me what you saw.
Yeah, okay, but if you look at the reviews of people who wore it, it looks really big
I want something that fits well on top and a little loose on the bottom, but I can't find it.
Well, it's hard to find
You have to look at those people's heights and the length of their pants carefully. ㅜㅜ
It's hard... Kiki
I'm looking around Inshow these days, but I can't find any clothes that really appeal to me.
I need to buy some long clothes!
Kiki No, but actually, I don't even go to shopping malls these days, it's annoying
I didn't even have time to go shopping Kiki
And when there's nothing in particular you want to buy, don't look
Kiki I went to work this morning looking around!
But I'll just go and see it after the exam is over...
Where do you usually buy them when you shop offline?
I mostly buy from Apple and Brandy
Isn't that an online shopping mall?
I don't know much about offline here ㅠㅠ
I went to Yeongdeungpo Times Square!
Hey, have you been to the newly opened Hyundai Department Store?
Oh, I thought you were offline, Kiki
No, I haven't been there
More modern?! Haven't you been there?
I was going to go there last time, but I changed my route to Times Square right away because they said there was a confirmed case there.
I went there for the first time and there were so many people. I was number 100 in the Blue Bottle waiting line.
But there were a lot of clothes, so I'm thinking of going again!
Did you see that Lee Min Ho and Momoland's Yeonwoo are dating? Kiki
Huh, actor Lee Min Ho? Kiki
What do the two have to do with each other? That's strange.
Oh my goodness, but I just saw someone named Yeonwoo and she's so pretty. It's my first time seeing her. Kiki
I heard Yeonwoo was acting, so maybe that's how they met
But everyone Lee Min Ho dated said Kang Dong Won as their ideal type, so Lee Min Ho said that he was dating Kang Dong Won in real life instead of Kang Dong Won, which was hilarious.
No, Kiki Kang Dong-won is everyone's lover...
He doesn't look like Lee Min Ho at all, it's really funny
Who did Kiki Lee Min-ho originally date?
In that example, who is the female lead in Sooji and Secretary Kim? I saw her picture and didn't know they were dating, but I guess they were.
Ah, Park Min-young! You dated Kiki Park Min-young too?
He only dates pretty girls... He really is a thief!
Kiki, I think I heard that you're dating Suzy
You dated Park Min-young too, you're so far away
Kiki: But people say that you look best with Park Min-young.
And according to the article, when Lee Min-ho is in a relationship, he doesn't hide it and confidently enjoys dating outside.
We even watched a late night movie together outside and stuff.
Oh, that's nice. I saw that Joy and Crush dating too... They look good together ㅠㅠ
Kiki Joy Crush I saw Kiki
But these days, everyone wears masks, so I don't think anyone would know if celebrities were playing outside.
No, even if you wear a mask, if you know the face, you will recognize it.
I also went to Mom's Touch wearing a celebrity hat and mask, but they still recognized me Kiki
Yeah Joy Crush suits you so well and it's cute
Wow, which celebrity was there?! That's amazing.
Kiki, who's right? What do you think?
Do you know Kim Sung-oh? His eyes are the brownest I've ever seen.
It's really amazing, but I found out later that a lot of people in my neighborhood seem to have seen it.
I think we live in the same neighborhood
Oh, I know, I know! That guy is a great actor.
I also want to see a celebrity while passing by
I'm curious about Cha Eunwoo in person
Oh, I know Kim Seong-oh, he's the bad guy from That Man Kiki
If you see Cha Eun-woo in person, you won't be able to get away from him...
Kiki Really? I hate Cha Eunwoo's face the most...
And actually, I heard that your skin is really bad, so I saw that unedited photo.
Oh my, but if you just look at him, don't you think he's really handsome?
Regardless of my ideal type or anything, I just think he's handsome...
Right, what is the reason? Then what about Ssamdi? His facial features are sharp
He's more pretty than handsome... He doesn't look like a man.
Samdi is okay, but his forehead is too wide Kiki
**Hey, you're a bit picky ^^ Kiki
You must be really picky
I really want to see Kiki Kunikida and Samdi in person. They're so handsome!
I really enjoyed Haeundae when I was young, so I wanted to see it again this weekend, and it was fun!
The aftertaste is completely lingering
I think I saw Haeundae. Is it a disaster movie?
Kiki Haeundae is a really old movie
Now that I think about it, I remember the elevator filling up with water
Yeah I love disaster movies. Yeah elevator.
** Sister, you have a great memory. I only remembered Lee Min Ho.
When I saw the poster, I totally remembered it!
Are you talking about Lee Min-ki, not Lee Min-ho? Kiki
Kiki I don't remember the main character Kiki
At that time, it was so full of water that it was so shocking that I think it was memorable.
Yeah Lee Min-ki Kiki kept talking about Lee Min-ho and made a mistake Kiki
I was too young to remember much of it
No, Lee Min-ki was really memorable, and he was still so cool when I saw him again
Lee Min-ki is so charming Kiki
What movie was that with Kim Min-hee and Lee Min-ki?
I don't remember the title, but it was a completely realistic love story.
Kiki, I saw that too, Temperature of Love
Kiki, you both act so well and realistically
But I don't remember what the ending was
Yeah I like Lee Min-ki haha right I don't remember
I need to watch Kiki again, just the two fighting in an amusement park on a rainy day
I don't know the ending, but if the two break up and start dating again, people will dig up SNS and just be petty, but it's a completely realistic relationship, so people will sympathize with it. Kiki
Kiki, I think you felt a little annoyed when you came out
Do you remember the scene where they were using an umbrella in front of the subway station?
But I only watch happy endings, so if that's sad, I don't want to watch it again...
I don't think it was a pleasant ending for me either
I remember the feeling at that time more than the content
I feel like I don't really want to date Kiki
When I think of Kiki, I think of that recent romantic comedy movie, the one with Gong Hyo Jin in it!
The most ordinary love! I saw it at the movie theater~
Kiki I haven't seen that! If it's fun I'll watch it later when I have nothing else to do
Kiki Oh right, right, that's for killing time
It's fun because they're both really good at acting
My mom really likes Kim Rae-won!
When I think of Kim Rae-won, I think of Bread, Love and Dreams. He's in it.
Did Kim Rae-won appear in Bread, Love and Dreams?
I saw that, but the only thing I remember is Joo Won, Kiki!
Kiki, that's right, Joo-won was a bad guy Kiki
But I haven't seen that drama
Kiki, I'm confused. Kim Rae-won is a gourmet. They both cook, so I'm confused~
Yeah, next idiot~ Kiki, somehow the matching doesn't work out well
Kiki idiots idiots the most ordinary love affair it's been a while since I've seen you
Do you eat late-night snacks often?
I think I eat it once a week
What about your sister?
I live alone so I want to eat late night snacks but I can't ㅜㅜ
Yes, I guess the quantity was large, so delivery
Yeah and you have to meet the minimum amount ㅜㅜ
It's burdensome if the minimum order amount exceeds ten thousand won
right?
That's right, even around us the minimum order amount is 12,000 won.
Wow, that's really expensive
If that's the case, it would be better to pack it Kiki
Yeah, so I have to pack it, you know? I'm a homebody!
Kiki: Then you don't eat much late-night snacks at home?
I don't eat well
I have natto and almond breeze at home.
Oh, that really sounds like a diet menu.
It's creepy
Even the Almond Breeze tastes unsweet.
How on earth are we supposed to live without sugar? It's so unsweet and tasteless...
I think it tastes better without it!
Oh really? Then admit it Kiki
If you live alone, do you want to live in an apartment?
I want to live in an apartment later, so I'm saving up for a subscription!
Wow, when did you sign up for the subscription savings plan?
I just put it in for the first time this year, but I don't know when it will go away.
I've been putting it in since this year, but how much are you putting in?
I put in about 50 thousand won a month
What about your sister?
You have a higher chance of being accepted than me.
I have 20,000 won hehe.
Aha, where is the bank?
I heard it's better to put in the basic 50,000 won ㅠㅠ
I'm putting it in Kookmin Bank
No, as far as I know, 100,000 won is the best!
Yeah, that's right. 100,000 won would be good, but the banker said 50,000 won would be best for my situation.
You even look at that
I just applied through the app.
Oh, I didn't know anything about subscriptions, so I went to the bank and consulted directly.
Good job, I didn't feel like going out so I used the app~
Are you planning to move to an apartment later too?
Well, I haven't thought about it yet, but maybe we should move to an apartment?
That's right, they're building a lot of apartments these days.
Have you ever been on a boat?
I've been on a cruise ship, but it wasn't that great.
How can a cruise ship be so bad?
Yeah, I got really seasick because of the waves.
Oh my, I guess you went on a day with bad weather!
Yeah, that's right, I almost threw up then
And I'm scared of falling into the sea
Where did the cruise ship go?
I rode it when I went from Geojedo to Jangsa Island.
Who did you go with that time?
I went with my family during summer vacation, Kiki
That must have been really fun
If only the weather was nice and the waves didn't crash!
Yeah, but I hate my stomach so much
Sister, have you ever been on a boat?
I went on a trip to Jeju Island with my company and rode a cruise ship!
Oh, how was it?
They say that Jeju Island has clear water and you can even see dolphins.
We played inside, drinking wine and eating snacks.
Wow, that must have been a huge ship.
That would have been nice.
Have you ever had a job other than a part-time job?
No, not yet, just getting ready~
Oh, where did you work the longest?
Where I am now Lotte Mall Butter Kiki
Oh, how many months has it been there?
I've been going there for probably over two and a half years now Kiki
At that point, aren't you already an employee?
Originally an employee, but quit and re-joined to become a part-time worker Kiki
But what kind of place is that?
Kiki, a place that sells daily necessities
It's like a modern house~
If it's daily necessities, do you also sell home appliances?
Yeah, this summer the fan was a huge hit Kiki
How much did the fan cost?
It was cheap and good at 50-60 thousand won Kiki
These days, they call it a circulator. Is that it?
Yeah that's right Kiki
It was good
There's been a lot of talk about female conscription these days. Have you heard of it?
Yeah, that's right, they're making a fuss about going to the military, Kiki
What do you think about going?
I don't want to have children, but if I go, will I get extra points and not have to have children?
As for the issue of having children, it doesn't matter if you don't want to have children now~
Yeah but if you tell me to go I think I would
I honestly don't mind going.
Right, our country is a divided country, so national defense is very important.
But wouldn't it be better to improve the treatment of professional soldiers now rather than doing it like this?
Yeah, the soldiers are treated really badly.
Then I think it might be a good idea to consider a female conscription system!
Anyway, it takes a long time to build a women's bathroom in the military~
That's right, Kiki. It still seems like a story from a far away country.
But I heard the national petition has over 50,000 signatures Kiki
Who pressed all those buttons ~ Really ^^
First of all, it's not me, don't worry~
Not me either,
But it still seems difficult to conscript women
You said you were studying editing now, right?
Yeah, that's right. It helped me a bit with my self-development.
Where specifically did it help?
It was nice to be able to access various media ~
Is there a qualification exam for that too?
I don't think there is a separate certificate, but there is some kind of training required.
I see. Are you receiving that training now?
No, I'm learning on my own at home!
Are you learning by buying a book?
No, I made it by following along on YouTube
So you studied so hard and now you work part-time as an editor for YouTube?
Yeah, that's right! It's not a part-time job, it's a side job.
Still great though
Later, when I create a YouTube channel, you help me edit it!
Okay, please like and subscribe, I'll make it ^^
Wow, this is so good
I'm already looking forward to it!
The profit is 6:4, okay? ^^
I am 6
How is your little mom doing these days?
I'm taking online classes because of Corona.
What were you doing at that time? What was that?
Yeah, I had a few face-to-face lessons when things got better, and everything changed.
So you're not going to do it on Zoom anymore?
No, it's completely changed to zoom, it's level 4
Right? Are there a lot of students?
Well, I think there are about 10 people, so it's fixed.
How many hours does it take to take a class like that?
I have two hours a day, morning and evening.
3 days a week
So what do you do with the rest of your time?
Mom, do some personal exercise or go hiking often.
As expected, you take good care of yourself.
Kiki, you have the best body among us all
Yeah, but I can't help it because of my mom's job...
That's true, but I guess there's a lot of damage because of Corona!
Yeah, I'm worried because my income has decreased so much compared to last year.
How do you and your boyfriend celebrate anniversaries?
I like giving gifts, but my boyfriend just likes to eat delicious food all day long.
How did you celebrate this first anniversary?
We just gave each other gifts that we wanted.
What gifts did you give each other?
I bought shoes through overseas direct purchase and my boyfriend bought a necklace from Tiffany &amp; Co. ^^
Wow, isn't that a really expensive jewelry brand?
Yeah, but the cheapest one among them,
Everything else was too expensive
But that was only the first anniversary!
Yeah~ But these days, everyone gives a lot of expensive gifts, Kiki
I could never do that ㅜㅜ
Oh really? Right ㅠㅠ But I feel good when I actually receive the gift~
That's what everyone thinks
What brand are your shoes?
I guess New Balance 993 is really popular
New Balance also has a wide range of prices depending on the number!
Yeah, that's right, the one I chose was a bit expensive
I'm worried because real estate prices are rising so much these days.
Your real estate is a mess, I don't even want to look at it.
Do you live at home with your family or do you live alone?
Until recently, I was living alone, but now I live with my parents again.
I think moving back home has its pros and cons.
Does your brother live alone?
Yes I live alone
I think it's been a long time since I've lived alone
What do you like best about living alone and living with family?
Well... I think the biggest advantage is that I don't have to do any housework.
What is the most difficult thing about living alone?
What's difficult about living alone? Well, I don't think there's anything particularly difficult now.
I think the hardest thing is spending money.
Do you have any plans to go out again?
Yes. I think it's hard because you inevitably have fixed expenses when you live alone.
I don't have any plans for the time being, but I think I'll become independent again later on when I've settled down a bit.
So what are the good things about living alone?
The good thing about living alone is that I can do what I want without worrying about what other people think, and my friends can come and go without worrying about what other people think. I think that's good.
Where were you when you lived alone?
I have lived alone in many places.
Come to think of it, I've been living alone for quite some time now.
So, do you cook and eat your own meals?
Ah, I usually cook once in a while and eat out most of the time.
Cooking is good, but cleaning up is too much of a hassle... Is there anything you consider most important when looking for a room? The view, the size, the bathroom, etc.
I don't think I have any particular criteria when looking at a room.
I think it's okay if it feels neat at first glance!
I like interior design. Are you interested in interior design?
I don't seem to be particularly interested in interior design, but I like looking at it.
Have you ever tried self-interior design at home?
Every time I moved into a new place, I redecorated the interior.
When you get married, where would you like to live, an apartment or a house?
I want to live in an apartment
I want to live in a clean and bug-free place.
And I like looking out from a high floor, so if possible, I'd like to live in an apartment.
Where do you want to live?
If I were to think of a place without bugs, an apartment would be the answer, but I also want to live in a house with a yard...

I want to live in Busan or Seoul
I have a lot of friends in Busan and a lot of places to go in Seoul, so I'm having a hard time deciding haha

I'm looking at new cars because it's time to change them, and the designs these days are all so pretty.

I personally like sedans!
What kind do you like?
I like sedans too, but these days, car camping is becoming more popular, so I'm also interested in SUVs.

Um... I'm watching BMW this time, but it's so unrealistic that I'm just watching it.
Do you like things like car camping?
Yes, I like sleeping in my car.
I want to buy a camper van or something, but I can't do it yet.

How did you feel when you received your first paycheck?
I felt so good when I got my paycheck
What did you buy when you received your first paycheck?
I got my first paycheck and bought a motorcycle, and I felt so good.
Oh, I did a part-time job when I was in middle school. At that time, the hourly wage was 2,000 won, so I worked five hours a day and got paid about 10,000 won a day.
I bought shoes with that
Yes, the pay was really low back then.
I hear that wages have gone up a lot these days.
I don't know how you worked because your hourly wage was so low.
Isn't it hard to work these days?
I'm happy because I'm having fun doing the job I wanted to do.
How is your work these days?
It's fun because it's something I want to do too
The weather is hot so it's just a little hot
Does time pass quickly when you work?
The days seem to go by so quickly.

Thanks to this, I was able to train comfortably.
I was a tow truck driver, so it was really hard to carry the truck, dig, and dig the ground.
How did you feel when you were discharged?
Oh, I think I saw you come to our unit and train.
Before I was discharged from the military, I thought I would just feel good, but my emotions became a bit complicated.
How did you feel?
I had such a great time escaping from there. If you were asked to re-enlist, would you do it?
Oh! I guess I could go if they gave me about 1 billion won.
If I were given 200 million won, would you be able to re-enlist?
Yes, I definitely do it haha

I received tuition fees and went out to play hard haha

These days, students are king.

I think cats are more comfortable.
Oh, I also want to raise a dog or cat. What kind of animal would be good?
Well, if you're looking for something comfortable, a cat would be a good choice.
Are cats good at hiding their poop and pee?
Cats know how to navigate without being taught!

I feel bad for the big dogs, but I still want to report them when I see them not doing it.
There are a lot of physical accidents and things like that
I have a question. Isn't it difficult to wash a cat?
My cat hates water so much that I leave it to a company to get it for me.

Do you play soccer yourself?
I don't really like doing it myself either
Are you also interested in women's soccer?
I don't think I've ever seen women's soccer.
I've always liked baseball, not soccer.
I like baseball too
Baseball is fun to watch, cheer for, and play.
Do you go to the baseball stadium often?
A girlfriend I met before liked baseball, so we often went to the baseball stadium.
Do you have a favorite baseball team?
I used to like Samsung, but now I don't watch baseball much, so I don't think I have a favorite team.
Do you have a favorite baseball team?
I am a Doosan fan.
I especially liked Kim Hyun-soo, but it's too bad he transferred to another team.
I think Kim Hyun-soo did well this time. Did you watch the Olympic baseball?
This time I didn't have time to watch the game.
Did you watch the game?
Yes, I only read the article, but I remember seeing an article saying that Hyun-soo Kim did well.

I am very satisfied with the team's recent rebuild.
I did a rebuild last time and it was really good

I rebuilt in Munich
Originally, when I changed from Manchester City to Juventus, the balance of players improved.

Where is the tier?

I'm trying to get the Champions this time haha
Wow... you're really good at it...
It won't be fun if you do it with me..
Ah, I was good at FIFA 3, but I'm still not good at FIFA 4.
I get so angry while playing games
Have you ever gotten angry while playing a game?
I really enjoyed playing FIFA 3, but FIFA 4 seems to get weirder with every update.
They say it reflects real soccer, but the game seems to be going downhill more and more.
Your game has now turned into a running game.
Are you playing games today too?
No, I don't do it on weekdays, but I do it a little bit on the weekends.
I think it would be great if we could play a game together next time!
Yes, let's definitely play together next time!

I don't have any vacation plans yet.
I used to like going to water parks in the summer, but I can't go because of the coronavirus.
Do you have any vacation plans?
I don't have any plans yet.
It's so hot that I'm thinking of going to the valley.
Are there any good valleys near Seoul?
I think there are some good places in Paju or Cheongpyeong.
Do you have any memorable travel destinations?
I remember going to Japan
I went there before the coronavirus outbreak, and it was my first time traveling abroad, so it was memorable.
Do you have any memorable travel destinations?
I lived in Malaysia for a while before and I have a lot of memories from that time.
Where did you travel abroad?
I can't remember the name in Japanese
I went to the nearby one, but I think it was okay because there was a lot to see in Japan.
What did you do in Malaysia?
I went to college in Malaysia for a while and then came back because of the military.
Oh, that would be nice
What language is spoken in Malaysia?
Malaysia uses English as its common language!
Since there are a lot of Chinese people, Chinese is also used a lot.
Oh, you speak English well.
I also want to go to other places, but I can't go abroad anymore because of Corona.
Since I don't use English much, my memories are vague.
There's an island in the Philippines called Palawan, and it's really beautiful.
If you get a chance later, go there!
Yeah, isn't that place like the Philippines scary?
I feel like I've seen so many bad things
When I went there, there was a K-pop craze and there was a huge love for Koreans.
Is there a travel destination you would like to visit?
I want to go to Europe sometime!
The weather seems too hot these days.
Yes it's so hot

I hate summer too.
I think winter is better.

Do you like snow?
I liked the snow.
But ever since I came back from the military, I really hate my eyes.

I also live in Busan, so I used to love it when it snowed, but after I finished my military service, I started to hate snow.
Are there any ways to enjoy summer?
What a fun way to spend summer...
Does such a thing even exist?
In the summer, there's nothing better than eating ice cream while feeling the air conditioning.
I don't usually eat ice cream, but this summer I think I'm eating one ice cream a day Kiki
Yeah, that's right
They say it's going to get hotter and hotter...
Be careful of the heat!
Yes, be careful of the heat.
Be careful when you go to the valley!
There are a lot of social issues these days. Is there an issue that you are interested in?
What do you think about that 30km drive from that children's protection zone, not these days?
It's natural to drive slowly in children's safety zones, but I hear there are people who abuse that...
What do you think?
Yes, I'm scared to go to the children's safety zone.
Are there any issues that interest you these days?
I think Corona is the hottest issue these days.
This is a big problem, we need to get vaccinated quickly.
yes that's right
At first, I was scared and thought that many people get vaccinated but fail because of it, so I was thinking of not getting vaccinated. But since almost all of my friends got vaccinated, I want to get vaccinated soon too.
But this time, even after getting vaccinated, the number of people infected with breakthrough infections continues to increase, and it's really scary.
Oh, right. What do you think about not allowing businesses to operate after 10pm?
Well, I don't think it really works.
It feels like only the self-employed are suffering.
What do you think about that part?
I think so too
There are people who finish work late and don't even eat after work.
Do you think that 2 people and 5 people have meaning?
If we limit the number of people, will people not gather?
I don't think so.
Anyway, even if you go to a restaurant or a large mart, it's always crowded with people, so what's the point?
Yes, that's right.
It's a shame, I wish it had been done a little differently
Are there any good ways to deal with this?
I think a very certain way would be to implement a lockdown like foreign countries and quickly and definitely catch the virus.
Otherwise, I think we need to find a new way to coexist with Corona like Israel.
Is there any good way?
I think it would be better to do that in bars and places like that rather than just applying it to all industries.
I think people make a lot of mistakes because their judgment is clouded when they drink alcohol.
Yes, that sounds like a good point!
Is there anything you want to do once the coronavirus is over?
Yes, I want to travel abroad.
What do you think about Japan hosting the Tokyo Olympics this year?
Ah, I don't understand why they are forcibly holding the Olympics in Japan.
**What do you think?
I also wonder if it is right to hold the event in these times.
I even got the feeling that they hadn't prepared properly for the Olympics.
Did you know that there was an incident where the chairman of the Harry Potter publishing company gave his entire fortune of 1 trillion won to his mistress?
Yeah, if you just read the article, it feels like a fraud case, doesn't it?
I also have a feeling that something is fishy.
They say a will was discovered... Is this possible?
I envy that woman.
I saw in the comments that the best job in this era is being a housewife. Kiki
If you earn too easily, won't you also squander it too easily? Haha
Even if I end up blowing it, I want to use it as much as I want to use it Kiki
It won't be easy to use all 1 trillion Kiki
Did you know that Bill Gates and his wife recently divorced?
I heard you're going through a divorce. Has it been finalized?
It looks like they've divided up the property, but the amount is enormous: 175 trillion...
Wow... That's 175 times the amount from before.
How would it feel to have that amount of money?
I think I'm just forgetting what money is.
Looking at the divorce, it looks like he divorced because of an affair. He's a bad guy.
For most rich people, cheating seems to be a default option.
Kiki, I hope your divorce goes well and you live well from now on...
Are you interested in beauty?
I was very interested when I was young, but I think I've lost interest these days.
Are you interested in beauty?
I think I'm not as interested as I used to be.
I saw something about beard removal recently and it looks good.
Oh, I saw it once before, but it was too expensive.
You have to keep going and you're not interested in dieting?
Are you interested in dieting?
I make resolutions every day, but I never actually put them into practice.
Do you have a diet plan?
Yeah, I've gained a lot of weight now.
I recently went to my hometown and my friends all teased me for gaining weight, so I need to lose some weight. Kiki
Do you have any tips for dieting?
In the past, when I was working out, I strictly controlled my diet and exercised...
I don't have any tips, but I think it's really good to control your diet and exercise regularly!
I also want to exercise regularly, but it doesn't go as well as I want.
Is there a place you would like to get plastic surgery?
I would like to completely tear it all down Kiki
The area I want to do the most is my nose.
Is there a part of your body that you would like to have plastic surgery on?
I want to make my face smaller Kiki
My ears hurt so much when I wear a mask because my face is big...
Where do you go to the beauty salon?
Oh, I also want to reduce the size of my face.
There's a beauty salon I've been going to for a long time, and I go to the one near Suyu Station.
I'm dying from exhaustion every time Kiki

Yes, I get a perm once every three months, but I didn't have time this time, so I cut my hair, and it's all gone... I'm going crazy Kiki
How often do you usually get a haircut?
I think I usually get a haircut once a month.
Oh, I think I get my hair cut about once a month.

I'm styling it with wax and spray.
I recently started applying essence because my hair was so damaged.
Do you have any special hair care routine?
I don't have any separate care, I just apply essence haha
Are you interested in your health in general?
Yes, I've been gaining weight recently so I'm interested
Are you interested in health?
I wasn't really interested in it, but I recently started taking health supplements.
Are you taking any health supplements?
I don't have anything special yet, but I eat a few things my mother prepared for me whenever I think about them.
Don't your shoulders or wrists hurt when you work?
At first my shoulder hurt a lot, but it's getting better.
I think my posture has been really bad lately.
I feel like my shoulder area is a little sore these days.
Have you ever been to the hospital for shoulder-related issues?
I haven't been there yet, but I think I need some posture correction, so I'm looking into manual therapy or chiropractic treatment.
Do you have any experience in this area?
I've had acupuncture treatment a few times, but I'm not sure if it's that good.
I heard that chiropractic treatment is inexpensive because it is covered by insurance.
So, do you do any stretching or anything like that?
I think it's just a simple shoulder turn.
I think I need to stretch more often.
Have you ever been hospitalized?
I once had a serious leg injury and was hospitalized for a long time.
Are you okay now?
Have you taken care of things like insurance?
I'm a lot better now, but I think my pelvis has become very misaligned since the accident.
Ah, you have to take good care of your body.
Good luck
I'm thinking about starting to exercise. Do you have any plans to do so?
After this exam is over, I plan to start exercising seriously again!
What kind of exercise do you plan to do?
I just need to do some shoulder exercises
I need to do things like stretching more often instead of overdoing it.
And keep your posture straight
What do you think about e-commerce?
It seems very comfortable
What do you think about being able to buy it at home without having to go there?
I think it's convenient because there are more advantages than disadvantages.
Nowadays, we can buy anything we want with just a few clicks. It's such a convenient world.
Do you have a shopping mall or other website that you frequently use?
I mainly use Coupang.
I found the rocket delivery system to be really convenient.
Do you have a platform that you use frequently?
I don't go there often, but I search for various places and use the cheapest one. Hehe
Does Coupang have any advantages?
What do you think about e-commerce?
Even if you order it tonight, it will arrive tomorrow morning.
Oh, I did that, Kiki
How do you compare prices when buying something?
I usually just buy most things, but for things that are a bit expensive, I compare prices on Danawa and then buy them.
Is there any know-how on how to compare prices?
What do you think about e-commerce?
Are you interested in starting a shopping mall?
I'm not interested in shopping malls.
Are you interested in that?
I'm not interested in it, but I saw people around me doing it, and those who are good at it are good at it.
When I see someone who is good at something, I think they are amazing.
When you purchase a product, do you also look at customer reviews?
I think I mostly decide on things based on customer reviews
Which is more trustworthy, a customer review or a details page?
I think customer reviews are more trustworthy than detailed pages.
But these days, they say there is a lot of review manipulation, so it is not easy to purchase.
yes that's right
I, too, have often left my life up to luck.
What do you think about e-commerce?
Are there any TV programs you are watching these days?
These days I'm enjoying watching a program called I Can't Be Number One

No, this is the first time I've heard of it.
What is it about?
It was fun to see a married couple of comedians come out and show how they live together.
Do you have any programs you're watching?
The only show I watch is Penthouse.
It's a bit of a mess, but I think it's more fun to watch because it's a mess.
Ah, I want to see Penthouse too, but there are a lot of series out there.
How far did it come out?
Penthouse 3 is out now.
I started watching from 2 and I look forward to every Friday.
Do you have a favorite actor?
I have a favorite actor these days, but I don't know his name...Kiki
I think it's because I don't pay much attention to it these days.
Do you have any memorable dramas or entertainment programs?
I don't remember the drama because I was suddenly asked about it.
The entertainment program I remember the most is Infinite Challenge.
Do you have a favorite celebrity?
I also remember Infinite Challenge the most.
I like and respect Yoo Jae-seok the most.
I think it's amazing that he's never been criticized for always maintaining a good image.
yes that's right
It's so great
I really want to see Yoo Jae-suk once
Do you have a favorite singer?
I don't think there is anything like that these days.

I've been listening to Haze and Punch's songs a lot these days.
The voice was cool and nice

I used to enjoy Running Man, but I haven't been watching it much since Lee Kwang Soo left the show.
Ah, Lee Kwang Soo has left
Are there any TV programs you are watching these days?
What is your favorite movie genre?
I like action noir.

Oh, just like me!
Do you have any memorable movies?
I like fighting crime
Have you seen War on Crime?
Oh, of course!
It was really perfect, from the actors to the story composition.
Are there any movies you would recommend?
Is there a movie that Park Shin-yang was in? It's a bit old, but I can't remember the title...
They rob banks and stuff, and the actors are also happy with that.
Oh, have you seen the crime reconstruction?
Isn't this a really old movie...?
Have you seen a movie recently?
Before the coronavirus outbreak, I used to watch at least one movie a month, but I don't think I've watched a movie lately.
Have you seen any movies recently?
Lately, I've been seeing it mostly on telecommunications platforms!
I recently watched Fast &amp; Furious and Call Restrictions, and the call restrictions were a bit disappointing.
I don't think the Fast &amp; Furious series is for me.
Do you have a favorite comic book?
I mainly read Naver webtoons.
Do you know the cartoon called Tower of God?
I've heard of it but haven't seen it
I think Naver Webtoon only shows that lookism?

I used to watch One Piece, but I stopped watching it.
Do you like One Piece?
Ah, I don't like it, but it's famous, so I watch it on TV every now and then.
Do you have a favorite One Piece character?
I liked Ace the best!
Which character do you like?
I like nami kiki
Isn't it pretty?
Do you order delivery a lot?
My sister, do you order it once a week?
Oh, I have that much, but I don't order it often these days because there's too much left over ㅠㅠ Kiki
What do you eat when you order?
Just a regular tteokbokki pizza or something like that
I have some leftovers too, so if you just order them, I can eat them all day long Kiki
Kiki Wow, tteokbokki looks delicious. Where do you like tteokbokki?
I like the rose flavor of Yeopddeok! It's the best for spicy food lovers Kiki
What do you usually order, sister?
Oh, I also tried the Yeopddeok Rose once. Kiki, it was delicious.
I think I order a lot of desserts, like scones and things like that.
Oh really? I don't think I've ever ordered dessert Kiki
Do you know about Bae-tteok?
Do you know Bae-tteok? Have you ever tried it...
Kiki, oh my! No, I was just asking to say that the baetteok rose is super delicious.
I thought you never ate turtle chips ㅠㅠ Kiki
Kiki Turtle Chips, but when are you going to buy them?
Today I see the real Kiki
I can't play with you because you stink.
Kiki, but you ate turtle chip ice cream...isn't that enough?
Oh... I admit, I should try Kiki too.
Let's go eat again
Okay, let's go recharge Kiki's power
Have you ever thought about living alone?
It feels a bit half and half
Aren't you scared of living alone?
It's not scary, it's comfortable, Kiki
But it's so lonely, the house is quiet and desolate.
Sister, do you plan to continue living in Seoul?
I'm so lonely because all my friends are in Busan ㅜㅜ
It may change, but for now...
What is the biggest advantage of living alone?
The advantage is that I live alone and don't have to worry about what others think, so it's comfortable, right?
So what are the downsides?
The downside is, as I said before, it's so lonely ㅜ Even when eating
Oh! And I have to do everything myself, starting with Kiki's laundry...
Sister, is this a monthly rent or a deposit?
I rent Kiki
I'm only going to live here for a short time, but it's such a waste of money
Yes, if it's monthly rent, it seems like a real waste. How much is the monthly rent?
I have 500,000 won and a small one-room... Kiki
With this money, I could go to Busan and live in a much better place.
It's really tough, and if you live alone, you have to spend money on everything.
Yeah, really, starting with something like toilet paper, Kiki
Stay close to your parents until you get married.
I wasn't thinking about that anyway Kiki
I'll have to ask my sister when I leave home later.
How long did it take you to get from home to work?
It took about 40 minutes and was difficult at first, but now it's like nothing happened and I can do it no matter how hard I try.
Right ㅜㅜ
I've gotten used to it more than before. Are you taking the subway?
Yeah, I'd like to drive, but I think that would be harder since I'd have to leave earlier. Kiki
Is your sister ready to go to work?
At first, I couldn't get used to it at all ㅜㅜ Kiki
As I keep going, I think it's okay Kiki
I want to try riding the bus, but everyone says to just take the subway to work, right?
Yeah Kiki you really might be late. If you really want to ride, try taking the bus home from work. You might never want to ride it again!
Kiki, really?
Is it possible that I won't be able to go to work?
Kiki At least not here
Sister, are you thinking of buying a car?
It's totally there Kiki
I'm having a harder time now because I drive around Busan most of the time.
Oh really? When did you buy it?
Oh, it's not mine, Kiki
I use it with my mom, but I mostly use it Kiki
Do you want to buy a car?
Yeah, I think it would be nice to have tea, Kiki
You need more practice, right? What kind of car do you want to buy, sister?
I don't really have a dream car, just Kiki
Just any SUV Kiki
What kind of car do you want to buy?
I don't know Kiki
What car do you think would suit me?
Kiki, let's find out together, go go
Okay, I'll go with you when I buy a car.
How's your work life? Is it worth it?
Yeah, everything seems fine except for the fact that my sister next to me keeps saying weird things. What about my sister?
Wow, you're exactly like me, Kiki
I also have a younger sibling sitting next to me, Kiki
Kiki, is this your first job?
Kiki: Is this your first full-time job other than a part-time job?
What's the little brother next to you like? Haha
Oh, I'm so excited for my first job. Aren't I Kiki?
My younger brother next to me will have no comment
Where did Kiki go for her first job?
I majored in hotel management, so I worked at Kiki Hotel for about 2 years?
Really? How was it? I wonder
There are pros and cons. It was hard dealing with people because it was a service job, but it was fun. Kiki's office work is good because there isn't much dealing with people, but it's too monotonous.
What was the best thing about working at a hotel?
Because it was a scheduled work day, it was quiet wherever we went to rest and play while other people were working.
That was really good
Ah seriously, playing on weekdays is the best. It's cheap and there aren't many people.
What's difficult?
The hard part was that I had a hard time scheduling work so it was really hard to coordinate with the kids Kiki
It's somewhere between pros and cons
Kiki, wasn't there any territoriality there?
Kiki, you have a lot to say, let's meet up
Okay, come out right now
Wouldn't winter be better than enlisting in the military on a very hot day? What do you think?
Yeah, I think people with really weak skin would get tanned and their faces would get red and it would be really hard ㅠㅠ
I feel so sad that I cry all the time
Right ㅠㅠ But it's freezing and I'm going to die if I get it in the winter, and when I think about training... it just feels like summer Kiki
If I go to the military, do you think I'll be able to survive?
But I think it would be fun if people got along well.
Now, I feel like crying during training, what about Kiki?
Kiki, me too, but when we actually go, we'll get used to it and both of us will do well. Kiki, that's right.
I think it would be fun to spend time with my sister Kiki
I have to harass you all the time
You you? I'll bully you Kiki. How dare you bully me?
Kiki, but going to the military and shooting guns and stuff sounds fun, right?
Isn't there something like experiencing military life? Isn't there?
Yeah, it seems like it happened a long time ago. Come on, come here. Aren't you curious about chemical, biological, and radiological warfare?
Kiki Ni should have gone...
Then, would you like to try it first and let me know?
If you're going to go, let's go together. What are you talking about?
Kiki please go first. Please go first. Can you put an eye patch on it?
Kiki no let's go together we are together
Okay... Okay, let's go together. Apply.
Sister, apply first!
Are you studying hard for your qualifications?
no...
I really don't feel like doing anything this week, sis.
Oh, just this week? Every day is like this for me ㅠㅠ But the more I do it, the less I get points
Is the file getting harder and harder? Or is it just hard to concentrate?
Even when I do the same file, some days it comes out really well, and other days it just completely falls apart ㅠㅠ
Help me
How do you study, sister?
Just listen and hit?
Do you see and hear it too?
I first heard it and kept hitting it until I got past 90%
Even if there is a file that really won't go through even if I die? Until the very end?
Ah, seriously, if it doesn't work, I'll just watch it and hit it and it'll be over 90
If you look at it, hit it, and then hit it again, doesn't it not hit well?
So when you say report, you mean private report on the internet?
No no
I listened to the reading file and played it until I got past 90, then I watched it and played it all at once and then increased the speed. Kiki
Why am I so stagnant Kiki
It really doesn't go up
But I don't do it in a variety of ways and I think I kept hitting the same file when I first got stuck Kiki
What does your sister do?
I get stressed out if I don't come out for a while, so I take a break with another file and come back to Kiki
Then it turned out better than before
Try hitting it straight and hit it at multiple speeds
Sister, I really grew a lot when I did that!
Kiki, tell me the good things about being an only child
My house is my world Kiki
To the point where there's no need to fight over small things?
Kiki Wow, you must have grown up with lots of love from your parents, right?
But Kiki was raised to be an only child and was very strong.
Ohgu ohgu I got beaten up so many times for not listening to things like this when I was young ㅠ
Oh, your parents are wise, Kiki.
Yes, it seems to have grown well. Kiki, I'm proud.
But have you ever been jealous of your younger sibling or older brother?
Oppa, you had a dream
My friends who have an older brother who takes care of me a little say that I'm fantastic. Kiki
Hey, isn't that what you mean by warm oppa?
Then yes, Kiki
Sister, at that time, my younger brother was 17 years older than me.
So your little brother is 17 years old now?
Kiki, I'm in 4th grade now
17 years difference Kiki
Oh really? That's your daughter.
I thought you were 17, wow
Kiki but everyone understood it that way
I bet you didn't think we were 17 years apart Kiki
Oh my gosh, seriously, you're so cute
Even though my sister got married when she was 20, she has a lot of children, Kiki
Be quiet, Kiki
You shouldn't say things like that so carelessly.
Kiki says he hears that a lot because he looks like me
Sister, are you really my mother?
What is a gene
Kiki our mom's genes are amazing
But he's so cute like a puppy because he's the youngest
Kiki, you look cute just by looking at the picture
Here's Delco
How old is your current boyfriend?
No, same age!
Sister, do you usually date people your age or older?
Wow I think I mostly date older brothers Kiki
Same age, just once, when I was in high school, Kiki
How are you doing?
It's literally tea-kong-taekong Kiki
It's fun
Oh my god, you always tease me, but I'm serious
Kiki, that would be fun, right? You have fun teasing Kiki.
How much did you buy!
Last month was one year Kiki
Sister, don't you go on blind dates?
Wow, it's still green! Kiki
I don't do blind dates ^^
Have you ever broken up and met again, Kiki?
I don't think we've ever broken up and met again.
What about you?
I broke up when we fought in the old days!
We've made up like this before, but we've never really met again after it ended Kiki
If I break up with you, block everyone
Kiki Oh, I block Kiki too
I don't like what I see, even the slightest bit, neither on Instagram nor on the people around me
Kiki, have you ever dated a younger guy?
Kiki, you're not even dating, you've only been together for a week?
I don't think we can date
What about Kiki Ni?
I never had Kiki
I mostly only met my brother Kiki
Why can't we date?
I don't know if it's the other person, but I feel like I have to take care of everything Kiki
I didn't like it, ah, Kiki, I guess so
A detailed brother is the best
I want to raise a puppy, but...
It seems too hard, right?
Yeah, and since they're both always out there, I think the puppy will be sad ㅠㅠ
Right ㅠㅠ
And they say that they have to get a lot of vaccinations and that the money that goes into this and that is not small.
Right, so if I were to raise a child, I would get married and raise the child Kiki
Since things are unstable right now, are there any animals you're interested in other than dogs?
Am I a cat or a dog? A cat or a dog?
Have you ever seen these guys, they're so cute?
Yeah, I think I know what a dog and cat are
My friend's cat was wary at first, but after sleeping for a day, he came to me and kneaded me. It was really cute.
Wow, that would be so cute ㅠㅠ
What did your friend say? Did you have any difficulties raising a cat?
Real hair is the best
They're Persian so their hair is crazy
Oh, you're losing a lot of hair
Kiki, is it true that if you wear black, there will be chaos?
Yeah, and the hair really clumped up
That was a bit surprising
But puppies are totally like that too
Yeah ㅠㅠ I've heard Kiki a lot
My brother and I have a hamster at home, and it escaped from the house a while ago and caused a scene.
Oh really?
Did you just go out of the house?
Hey, I caught it after it was somewhere in my house for two days. It's creepy.
So I'm planning to take him out for a walk soon.
Wow you're cute Kiki
what is your hamster's name
Hayang was named by Kiki's younger sister
Show me the picture
I'm curious Kiki
Do you like outdoor activities?
Camp or something like that?
I've never been camping properly before Kiki
Sister, have you ever been camping?
Oh really?
I love this so much, car camping is so great these days ㅠㅠ
Go there once and you'll fall in love with it!
What I'm most curious about is, then what about things like bathrooms?
Oh, there's a public restroom next to that place Kiki
It's a bit inconvenient to wash, so when I go car camping, I usually go in the evening and wash up.
Let's play all night and come back in the morning after taking a quick shower
So I want to try it too, but I feel like I can't go right away because of the bathroom.
Do you cook and eat there?
Wow, I ordered grilled meat and ate it, and the mood was awesome.
Just take on the challenge
Did you go with Kiki's friends?
I went with my friends and I went to all kinds of places, lol
You and your boyfriend can go together. Go and try it once.
Kiki, whenever we talk about camping, you're already scared, but since you have to do everything yourself, Kiki
Kiki, help me out, I can't help it.
Oh, by the way, did you see the episode on I Live Alone where the guy from Itaewon Class goes camping?
No, no?
who?
I forgot the name, but is that the car camping that my sister was talking about with EXO Sehun?
Kiki, you really have a lot of emotions when you do that
Oh really? Kiki
I have to go to your store. I can't.
I'll open your eyes
Yeah, really, let's go!
I think it'll be so much fun
Tell me about Overwatch!
I was completely ignored today
It's been a while since I've played Overwatch ㅠㅠ I feel like playing it now
Sister, do you like board games?
I really like Kiki
Do you still have a favorite game to play when you go to a board game center with your friends?
I don't really know the name of the game because it's a game that's recommended rather than a game that I like.
But it's always a new game every time I go, so it's exciting.
There are so many kinds
I recommend Kiki
Try saboteur with your friends
Haha, awesome
My friend bought that for me and I tried it when we went over to play before!
No it's so funny really Kiki
If you act, you'll get into a fight, really
No, but when I do it with my close friends, they immediately know when I'm lying.
That's even creepier Kiki
Yeah Kiki
I think you can figure it out right away, Kiki
Have you tried Splendor and found it fun?
No, what game is that?
It's too hard to explain Kiki
Let's go together next time, it's fun Kiki
Kiki yeah sis I'm a Halligalli god
Hey, if I put my hand on it, won't there be a hole in it?
Kiki is a bit sharp
Be careful hahaha
I won't do it Kiki pass my hand is precious
Kiki ah why let's do it let's do it
Where have you traveled domestically?
I think I've been to the main places though?
Busan, Sokcho, Yeosu, Pohang, places like this!
Oh really Kiki
I haven't been to Sokcho ㅠㅠ
How is it?
Yeah, I think Sokcho is the place I haven't been to.
I remember riding the cable car there, Kiki
Where have you been, sister?
I should go too
I haven't been to Yeosu, Pohang, or Gangwon-do either. I want to go!
Where did Kiki Unnie go in Pohang?
Cape Homi Kiki
Aren't you the most famous?
Kiki is right
That one is the most famous, but I haven't been there Kiki
Do you know the arrangement cafe in Pohang, which is in the opposite region?
Wow, I just looked it up after hearing you say that, and it's so pretty Kiki
I should go too
Have you been to Gyeongju or Daegu?
No, I don't remember Gyeongju because it was a school trip a long time ago. Kiki
There is no Daegu at all!
What do you like about it?
Daegu is famous for I-World Kiki
I used to go to Gyeongju often in the summer because there was a water park there, but I haven't been able to go recently because of the coronavirus ㅠㅠ
Seriously, both are my favorite places..
I like both amusement parks and water parks.
I can't go out much because of Corona, sob sob sob
Right? I want it to end quickly and go ㅠㅠ
Doesn't Seoul have a water park? Where is it?
Caribbean Bay Kiki
Have you been there? The equipment there is really great.
I haven't been there
I really want to go there ㅠㅠ
When Corona is over, let's go together!
I like winter I like summer Choose
Sister, do you like spring and fall?
No, I like fall too ^^
I was going to ask if you like it hot or cold, Kiki
Kiki loves winter!
There's a ski resort in the winter!
I like summer better Kiki
When it's cold, my body shrinks and it's hard to get up in the morning.
Kiki Oh right, it's really hard to wake up in the winter ㅜㅜ
I used to like summer too, but I think it's changed a bit Kiki
It's so hot these days!
Do you know why that is?
Why why why why why?
As I get older, I feel like I'm getting older
Sister, why are you doing this to me?
No Kiki, you really have to be careful too, you're going to get knocked out
Kiki Hugh I'm thinking of learning how to work out anyway. If I do it in this weather, dieting will be a breeze.
What do you have to diet for?
It's hot because of you, but it's even hotter all of a sudden
No, it's so hot that I feel like I'm going to lose weight
I think I'll do some strength training!
Ah, strength is important, let's go register right away
Kiki Oki Health Introduction Gogo
How much does it cost to see a movie these days?
It was around 12,000 won, but I think it went up to 14,000 won recently?
Oh my gosh, why does it keep going up? ㅜ
I'm just uploading this because there aren't many people these days due to corona, but it's seriously worth the price of a meal. Even if I just cut off two ㅜㅜ
ㅜㅜ Wow, so many things are changing because of Corona
However, at the beginning of Corona, there were no customers so they gave a lot of discounts, but since that didn't work, I think they just raised the price.
Is it true that Kiki costs 30,000 won for just 2 people?
Oh really? Because of Corona, I can't remember the last time I saw a movie ㅜㅜ
Hey, did you see the accident that happened in Gwangju a while ago?
No, what is it? What is it?
It was an illegal demolition site, but it collapsed because they didn't take proper measures?
But a bus got hit there and one student died and several others were injured.
Wow... I just saw a video like a black box, and it's collapsing right in front of my eyes, and all I can see is a white car. It's really scary.
Did you see that? But the people in charge had already left and were just watching without taking any action.
I'm so angry that they don't even stop the car from coming because it's dangerous.
What? Are those people doing the right job?
What crime did the people who got hurt because of that commit... It's really scary
What I'm saying is ㅜㅜ only the innocent people died
I don't know why there are so many accidents and incidents these days.
That's right, but these days Naver's real-time search has disappeared, so there are more incidents, but I don't think I know as much as I used to.
Oh right, at some point it disappeared? I didn't know.
That's why I still regret that the real-time search disappeared
Did you see how great our country's swimmers were this time?
Kiki is handsome too
Kiki, I saw it on YouTube too
What kind of hobby is it? The person who came in first place is that person, right?
Oh really?
Yeah, people who work hard like this should leave. I think there are too many people who are causing problems at the Olympics. Kiki
Right, but these days, there doesn't seem to be much controversy over biased judgment, right?
Ah, but I think there was a little bit, but when I look at it this time, ㅠㅠ
I was thinking about this while swimming, didn't Sun Yang dope too?
Oh yeah, it appeared in an instant and then disappeared right away ㅠㅠ
He got caught doping, but he kept refusing and it was chaos.
Kiki, I heard you can't even compete in the Tokyo Olympics this time and it's been suspended for 4 years.
I thought you were doing too well!
That's why Kiki ㅠㅠ
He came to the house of a doper and suddenly got sick because he said he didn't do it. Kiki
Oh right
Did you see the news Kiki?
But I found out that doping tests were done like that because of Sun Yang Kiki
Kiki, I just found out too
What a shame, what a shame ㅠㅠ
You have to do it with your own ability. I guess you think other people can't do it, so you have to try hard.
China is really a place where foul play is foul play and there are a lot of people who are good at it, so why do they do that?
There must be more accidents because there are so many people. That's why Kiki
In our country, accidents and incidents occur every day, so I think China is really going to be a huge deal.
Including unknown incidents and accidents that we don't know about...
That's what I'm saying
I feel like my skin is getting worse as I get older...
Hey, your skin looks nice, how do you take care of it?
No, but these days, there's no one who doesn't go to the management office.
Are you going, sister?
I went there once a year ago because my skin was bad, and it was really good.
Oh really?
I've never been there
So I want to go ㅠ
Oh my, why did it flip over?
Hey, what the hell is that little grain of rice coming up?
It was truly legendary, honestly
Wow, I'm glad you went to the dermatologist and got better!
I guess it works well
Sister, have you ever had a vaginal discharge?
What is extrusion?
When I go to the dermatologist, they squeeze out sebum that I can't see with my eyes, but it really hurts Kiki
But if you go to a dermatologist once, it costs about 50,000 to 60,000 won.
Oh really?
Shedding tears Kiki
Yeah, when I see my friends, they pay all at once and get a small discount.
The effect is visible though, so I'm also trying it Kiki
I also bought a 10-day pass and went once a week.
It's really painful every time I go, but it's nice because it feels like I'm being taken care of!
Hearing you say that makes me want to go even more Kiki
But I heard that if you do it too often, your skin will become weak.
That's what laser treatment is like!
It would be nice to go to an event later and get a one-time ticket!
I guess so
Recommend me a hospital haha
Come to our neighborhood haha
Exercise: Did you say you liked hiking back then?
I don't like it, but I just do it occasionally?
Be careful not to get hurt while hiking ㅜㅜ
Sister, what's the biggest accident you've ever had?
Oh, I was taken away in an ambulance when I was in middle school, Kiki.
Oh my god, why did you take an ambulance?
After finishing the midterm exam at school, Kiki cut his knee on broken glass while playing.
It wasn't a riot
Did you buy anything big?
I've never had a cast on, but it wasn't a huge accident.
I think this is the end Kiki
You were quiet, Kiki?
It's not like that, but I have a feeling something happened, but it's not like you don't remember?
Sharp Kiki
I wasn't going to say anything, but I screwed up my head once haha
Look look Kiki
Tell me by chance
Kiki and I fell down a lot when we were little. What about you, sister?
Kiki, why don't you tell me?
How did you get hurt?
It's my heart!
Tell me about your sister
^^ I didn't fall down much Kiki
Can I ask you one more time?
Sir secret secret meron
Let's go buy summer clothes
Did you know there's a sale going on these days??
Where are you talking about online?
Just some information, online or whatever
There are so many places having sales these days, so I'm going to buy it
Tell me where you are Kiki
I don't really buy clothes these days, so I don't know, but I saw on Naver earlier that Misope is having a sale this time. Kiki
What is Misope doing?
I don't know, please tell me
It's a Misope shoe brand, and they say the price is reasonable and it's comfortable.
I don't know because I haven't worn it either Kiki
Sister, do you know a brand of comfortable shoes?
I don't know either ㅠㅠ
It's almost like I'm just buying from the ZigZag shopping mall Kiki
But zigzag is good
I think it's because I'm getting older, but the price seems to have gone up compared to what I saw at the beginning.
No, prices have gone up across the board these days ㅠㅠ Kiki
But I don't know the shoe brand well ㅠ
But I don't wear shoes often, so Kiki
And I don't think I'll buy any clothes either
Sister, do you buy clothes often?
I like shopping
But I only have a full cart
Kiki I'm the type that doesn't put anything in the cart and just buys it when I like it
Sister, where did you go shopping when you came to Seoul?
Offline!
I haven't tried it Kiki
What if I get lost?
Kiki I'm here haha
Just follow me
Tell me who your favorite actor is Kiki
I'm not like that now, but I used to really like Song Joong-ki! What about you, Unnie?
Ah, I like Song Joong-ki!
I used to like sharing... Kiki
You must have seen the real Goblin, right?
Oh, I didn't take care of it properly?
But Kiki has appeared so many times that I know all the content Kiki
Kiki unnie, that's awesome with you and Lee Dong Wook
But for me, Descendants of the Sun is the last Song Joong-ki work
Kiki, every time new people come out, they're all cool...
Fall in love every day
Kiki I don't watch TV much these days, so I don't even know who's on TV
I know that too, The Great Escape?
Oh, I've only heard of it, but I've never actually seen it. Is it fun?
The full season 4 just came out this time, right?
Please watch it from the beginning ㅜㅜ
Empathize with me
Oh really? What's that about?
It's literally escaping from the room, but it's on a different level than what we imagined.
The production staff are really crazy, but the people who solve it are also really smart...
Kiki, I only knew that Kang Ho-dong was in it
But it looks dark overall. Is that scary?
There were a lot of scary episodes Kiki
Yoo Byung-jae and Shin Dong-i's brains matched this? Kiki to this extent
Oh really? I have to go home and look.
Do you like Japanese animation?
Something like My Neighbor Totoro?
Yeah Kiki Ponyo and Howl's Moving Castle are crazy ㅜㅜ
I don't know how many times I've seen it
I saw Howl's Moving Castle quite recently.
But it's definitely that picture, and I really like the feeling of it being real! The colors are like that too.
Right. It seems like Kiki's animation can't keep up with Japan. Then what about Sen and Chihiro? Have you seen it?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's Haku too. When I was little, someone said I looked like Haku. Kiki
Hey Kiki, really Kiki, wow, it looks great. It feels like a pity. Kiki
That guy is sharp
What cartoon character does Kiki resemble?
I've never heard anyone say I look like a person, I'm just a character
The empty room is Ponyo... Moomin doll... something like that
Kiki I've heard of Princess Jasmine too
Hey I hate to admit it, but why do we look alike Kiki?
What is this? Who is this? A thousand faces
Kiki Jasmine reminds me of Aladdin. Have you seen it?
This is totally awesome
Aladdin Kiki is crazy ㅜㅜ
I didn't have any expectations at first, but I fell in love with it. I listen to OST every day.
Oh really speechless kiki
I used to hear it a lot, but now I can't even remember it.
Kiki, I remember the female protagonist as really pretty
Kiki, that's right, let's meet again!
What did you eat for breakfast this morning?
I had bean sprout soup and egg kiki this morning
Have you eaten breakfast?
I woke up really late today and couldn't eat ㅜㅜ I just ate convenience store pork... ㅜㅜ
I'm hungry
Did you eat at the convenience store?
No, I bought it and ate it at Starbucks!
Ah, sam kim at Starbucks... How unique~
Still glad I ate it
I can't stand being hungry
I was debating whether or not to buy coffee today, but I ended up just coming, and now I regret it...
I'm craving hazelnut coffee
Yeah, if you're thinking about whether to buy it or not, you should buy it.
But I also brought a tumbler to drink canoeing today, but I couldn't resist the temptation and bought it...
You only drink Americano all the time~ Don't you like something with milk in it? Like a latte~
I don't really like milk... I don't like the taste of lattes.
They say it tastes good if you add a shot. Do you like lattes, sister?
When I was young, I only drank caramel macchiato rather than Americano~
These days, it's so delicious to add almond syrup to Americano.
Oh, almonds?
I like Ediya's almond and that tomato nut latte!
Caramel macchiato was popular at one time, but it was neither sweet nor not sweet... Kiki
I liked the caramel macchiato because it was a bit strong and sweet.
Does Ediya sell almond syrup?
Isn't toffee nut latte almond? Kiki Dalla?
Is that almond chewy?
Isn't that what's in the topping, not the syrup?
Oh, I think so
It's been so long since I've been there, I don't remember.
When I was a student, I was an Ediya killer. Kiki
I was a tteokbokki killer and I still am Kiki
Sister, do you live in an apartment?
No I am a house
I've never lived in an apartment before~
Do you live in an apartment?
I'm going to buy an apartment!
Do you like houses?
I didn't know it was good before, but now I think the house is better
My brother lives in an apartment, so if I go over and visit him, I get so frustrated after a day that I can't stay.
Oh really?
I only have bad memories of living in a house. ㅜㅜ
Why was it like that?
I really hate bugs, but maybe because I live in the countryside, there were just so many bugs.
I think I saw all the bugs in the world there
Ah, I guess it's because it's in the countryside ㅠㅠ
Where was the countryside?
Me, Paju! Kiki's field...
So how many people were there in elementary school? Kiki
Oh~ Paju I'll try to guess! 5 people
Wow, awesome Kiki
Yes, there were 5 of me and 7 of my sister's class. Kiki
And since it's a house, it's really hard to go to the supermarket.
Was it because it was in the countryside?
Oh, I got it right! Awesome!
Transportation in the provinces is still very inconvenient these days~
I once walked to catch a bus in Daejeon and the crosswalk was cut off, so it was really absurd.
In the end, I found the subway and barely managed to get across.
The crosswalk is broken?
So the road just fell away? Like a sinkhole?
No~ Kiki, the road has to be connected to the crosswalk to be able to cross.
It's usually two or three lanes, but the road system is wrong, so I can't cross the street at the crosswalk. I have to take the bus.
So I searched in the blazing sun and it told me to go to the underpass, so I crossed that way~ Kiki
Wow, awesome Kiki
But I've had that happen to me before too
Last time I was looking for directions, I searched for the shortest route and it said to go across the Han River... Are you kidding me?
Are water taxis also considered a means of transportation? Kiki
I've seen a water taxi
Well, but I've never ridden one
Sister, have you tried it?
I just watched the person riding from behind~ I was scared because I thought my clothes would get all wet~
Oh really?
I didn't see anyone riding Kiki
Isn't that expensive?
I saw it in Yeouido, and I think the commute is 5,000 won.
Wow, 5 thousand won?
It's so cheap?
Huh? Is it good? Kiki
what's the matter
But only in Seoul
I don't know for sure either, so I looked it up and it seems that Jamsil Ttukseom ferry terminal and Yeouido are the only ones operating like this for commuting courses.
No, but if you think about it, it's expensive.
Because if it costs 5,000 won to go from Ttukseom to Yeouido, people will transfer anyway... right?
yes
Well, it's a boat, but once you get stuck on that bridge, even a taxi won't be of any use.
There are times when I really want to go swimming
I think it would be really useful in that case
What's going on, sister?
Swim there and die.
Wake up Kiki
Right~ But in other places, when you're stuck in traffic and in a hurry, you take a taxi and run, right?
But after the accident on the bridge, traffic started to be congested, so it was really frustrating.
In such cases, a water taxi would be very useful.
Oh right, awesome
I think it was 6:15 last time? I took the bus at that time, and it was raining, but it was still on the Han River at 8 o'clock...
I really thought you'd be disappointed... Wow...
It took me 2 hours to go a distance that was supposed to be 1 hour~
If it rains, there's no way.
You have to run Kiki
Huh? Run? Run? That far?
It's so clogged up, I thought that would be faster~ Oh, what's the name these days?
I really like the kickboard and there are a lot of bikes too.
Oh, that's it? Right
I like that too
But I rode it and it drove against the road so I won't ride it again... Kiki
I've never ridden one before
It looks really comfortable when going uphill. I should try it.
Sister, have you tried this at other places while working?
Working from home and stuff like that!
I worked from home sometimes while I was a warrior last time.
Working from home was harder than going to work every day
Working from home doesn't seem easy
Oh really? I thought working from home was better.
Actually, I chose Kiki because I could work from home.
Working from home is hard because the boundaries are a bit unclear. I'm working, but my family doesn't see it that way.
Wow, even though you said you were working?
What's going on? What's going on?
Do you think I'm playing like I'm playing a game? Kiki
That's not true, but I guess you felt comfortable because your daughter was at home, right? Kiki
Are you more interested in working from home?
Oh, I think I know what it is
If that daughter is at home, she'll be working, studying, preparing meals, and doing the dishes! My little brother's kid is playing! I'm working!
Kiki, what kind of part-time jobs have you had?
I've done movie theaters, cafes, restaurants, etc.? I guess I've done pretty much anything that makes money? Haha
What about your sister?
What else have you done besides this?
I worked part-time as a tutor
I really wanted to try coffee when I was a college student~
Wow, this is awesome!
Isn't tutoring totally awesome?
I was introduced to him by my teacher, but he was a kid who came back from studying abroad in Canada and said he was good at Korean.
What are you doing now? At that time, there was a fuss about you being a band vocalist.
Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow
I don't think I'll ever be able to tutor
I'm really bad at explaining things. But I think you'll be really good at it.
Something suits Kiki
I used my body, but my sister used her head... phew...
But I think the more part-time jobs you do, the better it gets
You learn a lot and gain experience. Have you ever worked part-time at a coffee shop?
I really wanted to do that, but now I can't.
Of course I did it~
I did it because it was in front of my house, but I think the hardest part was serving the customers, putting aside everything else. Because of the customers... ㅜㅜ
Oh, I love coffee so much that I just thought about that...
Yes, coffee part-time job is also a service job. My friend runs a cafe and gets calls all the time because of customers.
I feel stressed because it seems like people are complaining to me or getting angry or something.
That's what I'm saying
Last time, he asked for something hot so I gave him some hot coffee, but he threw it at me like, &quot;How can I eat something so hot?&quot; What the heck is going on?
That's true ㅠㅠ
What do you think military life would be like?
There are a lot of entertainment programs about military life these days, Kiki
Something like a real man? I really wanted to try that.
Cool~
Yeah right, Kiki
I just thought it would be hard, but you wanted to try it? You're the first person around me who wanted to try it, seriously Kiki
It's cool
I think that guy who is good at sports is so cool, and I think he is the epitome of a soldier.
Aren't female soldiers especially cool?
Oh, that's right
That's true, but I like just looking at it.
Just idolize me and I'll play Ding-Ding-Ding. Kiki
So, it looks good because I have a regular life.
My lifestyle is totally messed up ㅜㅜ
Yes, soldiers are really like swords in that respect.
I think I admire that kind of appearance because I'm not good at it either.
Oh, I really have to try something like getting a few degrees in Taekwondo in my next life.
Wow, I really wanted to try Taekwondo when I was young ㅜㅜ But these days, there are a lot of military issues. Especially for women.
What's the problem?
That female soldier sexual assault problem ㅜㅜ
It kept coming up and he committed suicide. ㅜㅜ I'm so upset.
Yeah, bad people...ㅠㅠ I think it's because the military is often isolated and separated from civilians.
So, on top of that, they have separate trials there.
There is a separate military judicial agency and medical office, it's a completely independent system ㅜㅜ
So he said it seemed more like that
But these days, military discipline is disappearing a lot.
Bringing in a cell phone and going on vacation, is that a good thing or a bad thing?
If we keep letting them off like that, won't military discipline become lax and more accidents happen?
Is that so? I thought the problem was with the hierarchy, but it's just too much.
Isn't there a military discipline similar to that of the PE department in our college?
If that's the case, it seems like it can never be solved by bringing in a cell phone or taking a vacation...
If you bring in a cell phone and start having problems with games or gambling, it will affect your classmates next to you. If you let it go like that, will they listen to what their superiors say?
Oh, that's what it was?
I thought it was a communication issue, but I never thought of crazy gambling. What the heck.
So, the world of cell phones is endless.
Sister, is there anything you want to learn these days?
I want to learn how to make coffee and I want to learn how to dance~
Huh? Dance? Dance? Kiki
Oh, but I also want to learn pole dancing.
Pole dancing makes your legs hurt so much~
I'm so tired and worn out~
Oh really? I saw Park Na-rae learning pole dancing last time and I wanted to learn it.
I heard you can learn how to make coffee with government funding!
Yes, but I have to set aside time and I'm worried because I don't have a place to use the certificate right now.
Should I just learn how to eat at home? Kiki Advanced Hobby Life
No, isn't your hobby life too advanced? Kiki
But once you start making coffee, you need to get the equipment.
I tend to buy equipment before I start anything, so Kiki learned coffee with the national budget around me.
I see~
Is there anything you want to learn these days?
I have so many!
I want to learn rattan and also knitting by hand ㅜㅜ
If it's rattan, do you make things like rattan bags?
Oh my, oh my, oh my, that's right
I have a cat
Kiki, the cat loves rattan so much
And I want to learn that too
That computer thing! I gave up.
How far have you come? Looking at the notes, the words are too difficult.
That's why I was learning handwriting, but the period ended and it just fizzled out.
Even the movers came... ㅜㅜ
That was also done with government funding haha
Oh, that's also supported by government funding~
My mom's birthday is next month. What should I do for her?
Absolutely no kitchen utensils or anything like that!
Oh my gosh! Isn't it good?
What should I do? There's nothing I can do for you.
Because it was Parents' Day a few months ago, we already did it once... ㅜㅜ
What did you give me back then?
I had a money box back then! Do you know what it is Kiki
And I went on a family trip to Yeosu. Where's your sister?
Wow~ My phone broke back then so I bought that for you!
Wow, the scale is completely different?
Wow, my dad also needs to change his phone ㅜㅜ He keeps saying the same thing over and over again, saying it can't be done, you know Kiki
I think Kiki's daughter likes it because it's meaningful and something she can show off.
Kitchen utensils aren't just gifts for moms, so I think it would be nice to give a gift just for her on her birthday.
A gift just for mom? Mom tells me to hurry up and go? Kiki
Why do you always ask me to do something so expensive? ㅜㅜ
Should I get that gun to shoot money? No money, just a gun... Kiki
Is there something like that? There are so many unique things these days~
I could go out with you and give you clothes, but you might think it's a waste, but I think a bunch of flowers would be nice too.
Ah, I gave you flowers last time, but if it's not money or flowers, don't bring them.
My mom seems to be a bit materialistic. When I say this, Kiki
No, all parents are like that
My mom is like that too
But I just stay strong
If not now, then when will you give and receive flowers as a gift?
That's why ㅜㅜ I just want to fill it with flowers... Me too... Kiki
No, there are too many things to spend money on
Seriously, what about me? Even on my birthday?
Birthday? Your birthday?
Oh Kiki, I only get paid on my birthday, but Dad gets paid on many other days...ㅜㅜ
Ah~ That's right Kiki
It's been so long since I've received money for my birthday, Kiki
Sister, is there anything you consider important when dating?
First of all, let's talk Kiki
I guess it has to be something like a gag code too?
Yeah, I admit it Kiki
I also have to have a gag code
But I also pay attention to the age difference
And absolutely no younger people
How much of an age difference is okay?
Up to four years old!
Below is something I've never really thought about
Isn't she just a kid? Kiki
I don't like dating either~
Someone said that the older you get, the more you like younger women.
Who is that Kiki
Funny Kiki, but that's what they say, but I really can't be the same age...
Ah~ Why?
Do you fight a lot?
Oh. Totally Kiki
It's almost war
I'm the type that just throws everything away, Kiki
If we're the same age, it's easier to talk. There's no answer.
Oh, that's true too~
If we were the same age, we would fight often.
The one I like the most is my older sister Kiki
Ah~ But now all my friends like younger guys Kiki
Meet up with younger people.
In the past, I only met people above me, it was really funny
I guess I'm getting old now Kiki
Right, that's right. What do you think is most important when dating?
When I first met my boyfriend
I am a speaker! Is the speech beautiful? The tone of speech is the most important.
That's right, it's rare to find a man who speaks nicely~
Has there ever been someone like that?
No, why would you look for someone like that?
Seriously, tears are welling up in my eyes.
That's right, so I think a lot of people keep pets while living single.
that's right
But when I raise animals, I really hate people who buy them from pet shops.
Oh, why?
Then where do you bring it from?
There are more abandoned cats and dogs because of those purebred cats and dogs. ㅜㅜ
I just adopted a stray cat, and there's a separate site for adopting abandoned dogs and cats called Pointhand!
Oh, I see
I didn't know that information because I only raised it when I was young.
Is the stray cat okay?
Aren't cats originally a bit of a difficult animal?
But I think it would be more difficult for stray cats because they don't get touched by people.
Um... I think that stray cat gave birth to kittens, but they didn't take the kittens because they got bitten by a human hand... ㅜㅜ
So I watched for a few days but the mother cat didn't show up, so I decided to raise it myself and brought it home!
It would have been okay if it was a young cat
It must have been really cute~
Good, good, good, good job
Yeah ㅜㅜ But now I'm so big and fat
This is so fat Kiki
Did you bring your older sister in and raise her since she was little?
Me? Ah, I only raised it when I was little, so I don't know where my dad got it from~
Ah~ I think of you when I think of raising a dog
When we lived in the countryside, my dad raised a dog to catch wild boars. The dog food looked delicious and sounded good too... So I tried it.
I've seen people eat it too Kiki
You said it wasn't tasty?
Has anyone tried it?
You're not eating that as stock, are you?
I'm a little worried because you're an eater. Kiki
Regardless of whether it tastes good or not, it's really expensive.
It's the worst
Ugh~ It's too much to even call it a scandal ㅠㅠ
Animals eat it because it tastes good, right?
Wouldn't that be so?
My cat food smells really bad too
Oh my that's so delicious I'm eating it, it's so funny and cute
I just wish there weren't things like pet supplies that are sold at higher prices ㅜㅜ
Do cats really like milk?
No, if you eat that you'll die.
Why? They eat it a lot in cartoons and on TV.
But these days, there are a lot of people who run with their dogs.
Does your sister like running too?
I like it sometimes. Definitely Kiki
But there are times when running makes me feel better
Wow, I'm having a hard time, Kiki
But maybe because of the Olympics these days, don't you want to learn archery?
Archery is good, but I want to learn archery.
Oh, that's right, that's right
I wanted to learn archery while watching Kingdom, but Kiki
But I have learned how to swim!
Oh, are you good at swimming?
If I fall into water, will you save me? Kiki
No, I'm not very good at it~
When I lived in Paju, I always went with my sister to learn and stuff.
It was fun when I was little, Kiki
I like water!
I really like water too~
But I can't swim
I want to learn
Ah! I asked you earlier what you look for when you meet your boyfriend, but there's one condition!
Oh my, what is it? What is it?
Do you like people who exercise?
Oh right
Someone who is good at sports and likes it, so I can go to the gym with them and especially! Someone who can teach me how to swim~
Ohhhhhh~ Are you serious about swimming? Kiki
But swimming consumes too much energy
I just hate exercising.
Kiki seems to only like playing in the water...
I want to try the butterfly stroke
Ah, the butterfly stroke is awesome
I got scolded for not being able to do that, Kiki
If you've learned the butterfly stroke, aren't you almost done learning it? That's amazing.
Well, I learned everything until the end~
But I loved the hot chocolate I had after swimming and while waiting for the shuttle bus Kiki
So it seems like it kept going...
Hot chocolate after a workout or strawberry milk!
But among the computer games, there's a game that uses that gun.
Sister, have you tried Sudden Attack?
I don't know much about computer games, but if you go to the arcade, there are a lot of them.
Yeah, I also play a lot of shooting games at the arcade, but I almost got motion sickness when I played them on the computer. Kiki
It's so dizzy...?
Oh, come to think of it, I've seen you do that before
The bigger the screen, the more it changes and it hurts my eyes.
That's why it's so difficult
I followed my friend to a PC room and the screen was too big
By the way, have you ever played MapleStory at a PC room?
What is Maple?
Maple Story Kiki
I only saw the commercials Kiki
Is that fun?
No, I think that's the only game I've played for a while, Kiki
It's fun, but it's getting harder and harder because I have to spend more money ㅜㅜ
Money? To buy items and stuff like that?
Hey Kiki, if I start again I have to finish it or else I shouldn't do it at all...
And it's not something you can buy with money, it's a hit or miss thing so it really sucks ㅜㅜ
Lucky or not?
Are you saying that you can't buy it even if you give money?
That's unusual
Ugh, I have to pay money to buy that lottery ticket.
And now I'm trying to pull it out, but good items don't come out easily!
Then I have to buy that lottery ticket again and draw again...
What the heck, this is almost like gambling~
Anyone who wants to do something will do it until it almost happens.
So Kiki, did you search for things like YouTube?
They spent hundreds of dollars...
But strangely, I don't want to use it for mobile games, but I really want to use it for computer games...
Oh really? It looks really fun~
Sister, where have you been on domestic trips?
I did a unique highway rest stop tour on the Gyeongbu Line.
Wow Kiki, what the heck is going on? This is so weird. Wow, what?
How do you do it?
My older brother lives in Ulsan, but it wouldn't be fun to just take the KTX and go down.
Sometimes I drove on the highway, sometimes on the national road, and I stopped at every rest stop I could find.
My mom likes that kind of thing, so I haven't been to any rest areas, but there are a lot of them in our country.
Wow, this is totally amazing.
Oh, it's totally different. It's awesome because it always takes the shortest route.
I want to go to Suncheon. Then I have to ask my sister about a good restaurant at a rest stop.
I haven't been to Suncheon either. Is Suncheon in Jeolla-do?
Should I give you my mom's number?
I just followed along so I don't remember~
Kiki, last time I went back to a rest stop because I wanted to eat sweet potatoes, and my dad said something really crazy. Kiki, sob, sob
Is Suncheon Bay that pretty there?
Oh~ I looked it up and there's a garden expo too~
I really, really like trees, so it would be fun to go.
Oh, that's right, you liked hiking too, sis~
I like going to botanical gardens too, but the bugs... ㅜㅜ
When I traveled to Jeju Island, I took pictures among those flowers, but there were so many bees that I only took one picture.
I'm not scared of bees~
They say they chase you a lot because of the smell of cosmetics.
Oh, so that's why? That's awesome.
I want to go to Jeju Island again. My friend lives there.
I can't see you at all because of Corona
If you go now, it will be nice even if it's hot, so it'll be pretty.
Yes, just going to Jeju Island really feels like going on a trip, so it's great.
People say that Jeju Island has become quiet these days because so many people are canceling flights. Is that true?
That's what they said, but my friend said it's okay now
The sea feels good no matter how much I look at it
Yes, I've been to Jeju Island, but I've never been to Udo Island.
Wow, Udo is awesome!
You should have gone to Udo, you idiot!
I thought I would never come back then, but I guess you have to try everything when you travel.
It's so hot these days. Isn't there going to be a typhoon?
Oh my gosh, that's so scary
But it didn't rain much in Seoul
Didn't the lower part come down a lot?
That's right, I heard there were a lot of people down there.
Jeju Island is like that too, and I've been there a lot when I've been to Busan, so this heat dome phenomenon? That needs to be broken.
Climate change is a big deal~
There are disasters all over the world
Yeah, have you seen that Canada?
It's 50 degrees, right?
Oh my gosh, it's 50 degrees Celsius?
Oh, so that's why the cars were melting and the trash cans were melting and it was chaos?
Wow, it's worse than Africa
That's right, I can't go to Daegu either, around lunchtime~
Oh seriously, it's so hot I'm on the verge of dying from a heat wave
But on the other hand, countries like Bangladesh and Russia are in chaos due to water shortages and the weather is so scary.
Oh really?
Is there a water disaster there?
Is it raining a lot?
Hey, should I send you a picture?
There's a huge problem with the trash that the water washes away.
This is totally awesome
They are polar opposites
Even if it rains, it's just a brief shower ㅜㅜ
I feel depressed because it doesn't rain much in Seoul.
The person who made the air conditioner should give it to the resident again every year
Yes, yes, it's true that we can't live without air conditioning these days. In this sense, climate issues are connected to society.
I feel so sorry for the elderly living alone and the low-income class.
That's right. Last time I saw it, there was an old couple who died from heatstroke because they couldn't pay their air conditioner bill.
If you look at Happy Kong or something like that, it seems like they're doing some kind of village support project.
I'm putting the air conditioner on, but I think it's a problem with the electricity bill.
Wow, there's a business like that?
Wow, this is awesome.
But what is the electricity bill? It's a progressive rate?
Doesn't that mean there's not much to it?
But if you install an air conditioner in a house that didn't have one, the electricity bill will increase, so it's a money issue, regardless of the progressive tax rate.
From their perspective, air conditioners consume several times more electricity than electric fans, so they will pay that amount.
Ah~ That's how it feels~ But it's still hard to blow with a fan
Until two years ago, we only had to use electric fans to survive.
But it really got hot all of a sudden
Yeah, right now, without air conditioning, I think I'd die from the heat. ㅜㅜ
But then again, climate change is accelerating, so when I think of polar bears, I feel so sad...
I support polar bears but I can't give up air conditioning. I'm so mean... Kiki
Are you joining us in supporting polar bears now?
Yeah! It's gotten a little too serious these days, but my family likes those kinds of documentaries.
So I was watching environmental documentaries all the time and I realized that raising animals like Kiki made me do the same thing. Haha
Awesome~
I also heard the polar bear story and it was so disappointing
I cried when I heard that people die because they have no place to step while swimming.
That's why ㅜㅜ environmental problems are so serious these days
But even today, I am a person who uses plastic, and I am so contradictory... Kiki
I can't not use plastic because of corona
I'm so anxious that I'm a little ambivalent too
That's right. When you go to a cafe, they say you can't use personal cups. But because of Corona, plastic is plastic, and some people say that eating seafood could be more serious for the environment!
Why eat seafood?
They say it's because the marine ecosystem is collapsing.
That's why whales are also banned from being caught
If you keep catching them in large quantities like that, the order will disappear, so it's all marine life that purifies the ocean. ㅜㅜ
Oh, really?
There are so many things I don't know
But it's scary that it creates social problems
So, is that why you saw the huge forest fires in Türkiye this time?
Yeah, but what's the cause?
I don't know that either Kiki
I also advanced to the semifinals of the women's volleyball team at the Olympics this time, and since the opposing country was Turkey, I saw it as a keyword search and watched it. Hahaha
Ah~ I just looked it up and it looks like I didn't find the cause
Opinions are divided. It looks like they are trying to exploit it politically.
Wow, wow, I thought it was because of climate change and things like the bushfires in Australia last time, but the political exploitation is a bit too much.
So ㅠㅠ By the way, Turkey won the volleyball game this time~ It was dramatic
That's why I almost cried
The game was at 9 in the morning. I saw it right after it ended. Kiki on the bus.
Sister, are you springing too?
I just heard about it
It ended 2-2 and he won in the 5th set~
I should have seen it
That's why it would be difficult
It kept going on for 5 sets
There are now two steps left!
I was ranked 4th in the world, wow, that's amazing
Wow! Kim Yeon-kyung did something great before she retired.
By the way, have you seen the American gymnast incident this time?
I haven't seen it. What is it? What is it?
No, those female gymnasts were sexually assaulted by their coach.
Wow... Seriously, why are you like that?
There are too many bad people
So, because that was exposed, everyone except Simone Biles, who just appeared, was kicked out...
It's true in our country too, and in the sports world, there's a lot of corruption and cover-ups, really...
But I want to do that
Hippie perm!
Oh my gosh, I saw one and she was so pretty
Yeah, Kiki, I want to do it, but I can't do it right now because if I do it with short hair, I'll look like Jung Jae-hyung...
Kiki Jung Jae-hyung
I'm curious
I don't think I'll ever be able to do what it looks like
Kiki, why don't you get a perm?
Ah, I'm totally into short hair right now
It's easy to wear, easy to dry, and very, very easy to manage.
Oh really? So that's why you cut it?
I have long hair, but I want to cut it short every summer. Kiki
Oh, and there are some things that go well with short hair
But I want to do that
But I want to do that
Ah, crazy Hagrid Kiki, no, but it would be nice to have a lot of hair
I have no hair... I'm crying
It's okay when you look at it~ Hair is very important for women
Yeah, yeah
So I wanted to fix that hairline too
Kiki looks so empty when you tie your hair
Oh, what is that?
That brush that fills in the hairline...
Oh, I think I know what it is
But I don't know the name either, Kiki
But you're not talking about black tea, are you? Kiki
Hairline Shadow Hairline Cushion I guess that's what it's called
I bought this when it first came out?
At a famous beauty salon~ But it wasn't that great
Are you okay now?
Oh really? Is that really true?
The eyebrow tattoo that gives you an eyebrow tattoo!
I even got my eyebrows tattooed lol
Oh, I didn't know
It's completely natural~
I want to do it too
Is it really comfortable?
Are there any vitamins that you take for your health these days?
I eat health supplements to get my vitamins from food.
Oh, health food?
When you say fill up with vitamins, do you mean vegetables?
I'm eating tart cherries right now
Tart cherry? What's that?
Wow, this is the first time I've heard Kiki
It's fruit!
Well, it's a type of cherry, but it's hard to eat raw because it's prone to getting chewed.
But vitamins and other nutrients are very rich, so I just eat one. As for vitamins,
Wow, this is amazing
I hate vegetables and fruits, so I tried to take vitamins, but I just bought them and didn't eat them. Kiki
What vitamins? Vitamin C? Multivitamins? Pills?
At first, I took Omega, but I stopped eating after taking 2 pills. Now, I heard that Alive is famous for its multivitamins, so I bought that, but I'm not taking it. Kiki
I always forget!
Ah, that Alive~ Even the advertisement is refreshing~
I have a lot of health food products at home, but I think I only eat a few of them regularly.
What I'm saying is that you should sleep at least 10 seconds longer than the time you eat that. Kiki
That's good for my health..
There's nothing better for beauty than sleep~
How much sleep do you get a day?
I think I slept for about 3 to 4 hours
I feel like I'm going to die soon
The original recommended sleep time is 6 hours.
The recommended amount of sleep is 7 to 8 hours.
What's going on? I'm going to die soon.
It's bad for your health, it feels like your life is decreasing by one second
I learned in college that if you don't sleep, your genes will be affected and your lifespan will be shortened.
I got a good deal from Carrot Market a while ago~
I've been using Carrot Market a lot these days. What did you buy?
I didn't buy it, but it's a cat product.
Someone said they were giving this away for free because their cat didn't use it.
Kiki bought a hiding place for the cat
Yes, I heard there are free giveaways too
Is that really free?
Oh my gosh it's really free
Sister, have you never done it before?
Yeah, I installed the app, but I haven't used it.
But there's something a little inconvenient about that
Yeah? What kind of point?
I wrote it so comfortably!
I found it a bit inconvenient that I had to select a trading area before searching for items.
It's not in my area, but there may be something I want in another area.
Ah~ right, right
That was really uncomfortable
I wish it was in other areas too, so I went to find a developer in something like Nego King.
Oh~ These days, there are more advertisements and people are using them a lot~
I think that person has found the right niche.
I think it would be really good if it weren't for the fact that trading is restricted outside of my area, but it seems okay to make a little extra money!
That's right, I don't use them at home, but there are a lot of new ones~
When I moved, I got an air purifier as a gift when I bought a refrigerator, and I sold that too and got a lot of money.
I got something good~
I need to change my air purifier~
That's something I always worry about when I'm living.
Buy online or buy at a store
Yeah? I had no intention of buying an air purifier, so Kiki only bought cat products...
The cat is having a good time~
I'm very interested in machines, so I usually buy cat-related items online.
I guess so?
Kiki seems to buy everything that is said to be good on TV
It seems like celebrities these days are advertising almost every product.
Do you tend to buy products that celebrities advertise?
Well, I guess it's more like YouTube than a celebrity?
I find YouTube much more interesting than TV these days.
That's right. These days, there are a lot of people advertising and introducing things on YouTube.
But I don't think I bought anything advertised on YouTube.
Have you bought it?
No, Kiki
I do a lot of one-person broadcasts these days.
I bought some of the stuff that famous people on YouTube recommended.
Cat Hancheong!
The show is about my precious baby these days Kiki
What are you mainly interested in growing?
I guess you have a warm heart
? That's not it...
Am I just disillusioned with people?
And my precious baby was chosen by the algorithm and I keep watching it? Kiki
That's what interests me~
I like seeing that kind of stuff too
Especially the kids, I didn't expect that, but that show was really good
There's a lot to learn
Right Kiki
If you look at it, the kids didn't do anything wrong...
Is it my fault that my cat ended up like that? Kiki
I also watch animal related stuff like Please Take Care of My Cat Kiki
Oh, there's a program like that too
But raising animals also requires real interest, affection, and skill.
Seriously, not just anyone can raise it~
I think it would be good to learn it
So there are so many interesting programs Kiki
There are a lot of weird pros, what was the most annoying pro? Kiki
I don't know the title, but it's a program where ordinary men and women, as well as celebrities, go on dates.
Oh right, that's the pair? Or is it not the pair? Kiki
But aren't those old love letters and X-Men fun?
Isn't it weird Kiki?
I think I've seen it that far
But after that, I hope that men and women will just be left to figure out their own relationships.
It all seems like acting and I feel like it lacks sincerity.
Isn't that too liberating?
Oh, I remembered
We're married, right? Haha
That's right, Jangmisanjang, Jjak, Woogyul, these days JTBC and TVN have been doing a lot of programs like that~
Sister, do you like movies better or comics better?
Cartoon~ Kiki
Actually, I like dramas more than movies, and between the two, I like comics better now.
Oh~ Is that the kind of cartoon they used to do on Tooniverse?
Yeah~ I do have a favorite cartoon, Kiki
Crayon Shin-chan, Detective Conan, Hiryu, old stuff like that~
What do you like?
Oh, I think I know what it is
Yeah, I think I like comics better now too
Comics from back then!
You know, there was this thing where they used to call Digimon ㅜㅜ
I miss you
I'm from the Pokemon generation Kiki
Ah Kiki but I'm also from the Pokemon generation
There probably won't be a generation without Pokemon.
I've been playing Pokemon for so long, Kiki
My favorite character was a turtle...
My sister is Kiki
I'm thinking about it now and I'm singing that theme song~
Oh, the theme song is that Pikachu, Raichu, and Squirtle?
Does that song sound sad when you listen to it now?
Yeah that song but why is it sad?
Aren't you sad?
Oh, is that Digimon? Hello Digimon... I'm going to sleep while dreaming of you... I think it was something like that
Are you sad?... Oh, I was young back then, but when I think about it, it's sad
I also like Cardcaptor Sakura's theme song~
But now that I think about it, the Card Capture Cherry theme song is sad~
I can't meet you, I want to meet you, but it's such a sad feeling~ That song starts like this
Oh my goodness, I admit it Kiki
Cardcaptor Sakura can't stand it Kiki
I really really loved that guy
Who are you? You're not the brother I'm thinking of, are you?
That guy is mine~ Cherry guy
Cherry oppa, right? Cheonmyeong oppa?
No, Cheonmyeong Oppa is too much of a fantasy
It has to be somewhat realistic
But what do you think about having an older brother who makes breakfast for you? Kiki
Cheonmyeong Oppa is the oppa that Cherry likes and later becomes a magician..
Cherry's real older brother, is that Dogun's older brother? Is that right? I like that guy~
My brother will make breakfast if I ask him to.
What did you eat for lunch today?
I couldn't think of anything to eat, so I went to a kimbap restaurant.
What did you eat, sister?
I ate the sandwich I bought this morning.
The menu selection is okay Kiki
I suddenly want a sandwich too
The bakery in the subway station was delicious, Kiki
Ah, the smell of bread in the morning vibrates Kiki
Today, I had a hard time deciding because there were so many sandwiches. Kiki
I think it's a good restaurant there. Subway restaurant Kiki
I want to buy something on sale when I get off work
Yes, they are having a sale after work hours.
I have to see Kiki when I go today
What did you have for dessert?
I was planning to have coffee for dessert, but as I was walking around, I ran out of time and couldn't drink it...
Kiki Coffee seems to always be with me.
I'll continue drinking what I used to drink in the morning.
I think I drank the coffee I bought this morning too quickly, Kiki.
Ah, you finished eating, Kiki
I'm still here Kiki
Ah, I envy Kiki
I'm debating whether I should go canoeing or not.
I need to recharge again by canoeing in the afternoon!
It seems like there are a lot of blogs and information about home decorating these days!
Yes, I also became interested in interior design, so I looked at SNS and everyone decorated it well. Kiki
It's easy to look around because you can even hang tags.
Aren't the prices all listed?
Yeah! I feel like I've been looking at the bed a lot lately.
Oh, there are a lot of mattresses and frames these days. Are you looking at both?
I'm looking for a bunk bed because my house is a studio apartment. Kiki
Ah, the bunk bed! I think it would be nice to utilize the space.
I'm looking for something that's a bit more sturdy for adults to use, but overseas shipping...
Overseas shipping takes a long time ㅠㅠ
Is the house a monthly rent or a deposit?
It's a monthly rental now, but it's Kiki's apartment.
Oh apartment!
I also pay rent ㅠㅠ These days, the price of houses in Seoul is no joke
Since it's on the outskirts, I think the monthly rent is cheaper compared to the area.
Ah, I think it would be good to get a little bit into it like that.
Next time I'm looking for a house, I'll have to look into real estate more.
These days, the app is so good that I can find out a lot of information.
Yes, yes, but don't be fooled by lies.
Aren't the cars really congested on the weekends these days?
Oh, is there a lot of traffic?
I only use the subway...
When you enter the road connected to the tourist site, it is almost like a parking lot...
Wow, it's hard to hold the steering wheel like that.
Do you have a car?
Yes yes I bought it used last year Kiki
I left Kiki at home
Hey Kiki
Then, are other family members riding it?
I'll leave Kiki with your cousin for a while.
I think public transportation is the best here.
That's right... I also have it at home, so I leave it at home and commute to work by subway.
Kiki The subway really goes everywhere, so I hate waiting for the bus because it's hot.
The bus runs whenever you have time and when the weather is good.
Oh, really, it would be good to use it when it's cool.
I think it would be a good idea to go a little further and look out the window.
Kiki, you end up looking out the window a lot for no reason.
It would be difficult to take the bus to work because it's far away.
I really can't think of a way to take the bus. The stop is far away.
Yeah, it's more convenient if you have your own car ㅠㅠ
These days, it seems like people aren't having company dinners at all because of the coronavirus, right?
Yeah, yeah, that's just how the situation is these days.
And I think we might not have to have company dinners.
So...
I didn't like it before, but there are places that are doing it despite the coronavirus.
Kiki, if you want to do it that much, why don't you go home and spend time with your family?
How is your work life these days?
Ha... I haven't been able to calm down much today... I got a pimple on my forehead.
Kiki ah kiki passik what should i do
Your work is very difficult these days.
Something doesn't seem right.
Every company needs an adaptation period.
Aren't there a lot of places that place importance on specs every time you enter?
that's right...
These days, many places consider qualifications as a basic requirement.
Yes, that's why I think I have to keep preparing.
How long do I have to prepare Kiki?
Only when you reach retirement age?
Well, these days there is no retirement age...
I think so. I worry about my salary every month, if only it had been a little higher.
Really... I want to negotiate my salary and stuff
I guess you'll do it once you get to a place where you can settle down a bit, right?
I wish it was a place with really good work and benefits...
I think welfare is really important
I think there were a lot of confirmed cases of coronavirus in the military. Cheonghae Unit?
Oh, I think so. You have to be more careful when living in a group in the military.
If you live on a ship, your routes would all overlap... I feel bad for the soldiers.
Yeah, most of them got caught...
It's not like everyone wants to get caught ㅠㅠ
Have you seen the recent Air Force incident?
that's right...
Ah, I'm listening to the black box recording, really. Ah...
Hey, did you hear that?
I couldn't hear it, but just imagining it made my heart ache.
Even though I keep refusing and all. Even if I go down and follow, really...
I thought that there might be something like that that doesn't happen in the military, but it's the reality... I'm so angry.
They say there are more incidents that go unreported than you might think.
That's right. The number of incidents that get buried must be enormous, because they're whispering about it from above?
Yes. I think I saw on TV that there are many suspicious deaths, such as deaths.
I wonder if the interrogative pronoun is really an interrogative pronoun...
Military life may not be easy
It feels like they're treating the soldiers like real parts...
Shouldn't everything above be changed?
There may be some people who don't... I guess this is a human problem?
that's right...
Any group has problems from the top down to middle management.
Yes, I think there are many organizations like that.
Do you remember any homeroom teachers or subject teachers from when you were a student?
Well, when I was in the third year of high school, my homeroom teacher, Kiki's nickname was Angel.
Are you an angel?
Were you really as good as an angel?
Yeah, he wasn't a very nice teacher, but he listened to all of our opinions. Kiki
Sister, does anyone remember you?
I had a history teacher who was on sleeping pills.
Oh, I think there is one teacher like that...
He has a low voice and speaks slowly, so the kids sing a lullaby and tell him to go away.
At that level, it really seems like a sleeping pill...
I like it when the class is fun and you don't realize how much time passes.
I think there are a lot of teachers like that these days. Kiki, a bit of a showman.
That's right Kiki, it was fun so that subject became fun too!
Yes, especially math subjects like Kiki
I hate math even though it's fun.
Oh Kiki, then what subjects did you like?
I think I liked Korean language and history.
What about your sister?
I'm Chinese! I always get 100 points
Do you remember any homeroom teachers or subject teachers from when you were a student?
Do you know your parents' wedding anniversary?
Yeah, I know!
It's winter, so I remember there being a lot of anniversaries nearby.
Kiki, are you celebrating your parents' anniversary?
I used to take care of it, but I haven't remembered it recently... I think I gave it as a flower gift when I took care of it, Kiki
Oh, I think it's great that you packed it, but still Kiki
I don't really...
Actually, it's hard to prepare for Kiki's birthday or 60th birthday or something like that.
That's right... If you just skip your birthday, your mom and dad will be secretly disappointed.
I really have to celebrate birthdays... but I always have trouble deciding what to give them.
Even if cash is better, don't you think about gifts rather than cash?
I think there are times when they give small cash gifts. Gift certificates?
Oh, they do that a lot these days, cake money cake!
That's right! There are a lot of items like bundles of money Kiki
Yes, that's why I put money in a flower bouquet for my younger sibling last time.
I really like Kiki
It's true that cash is the number one priority, Kiki
Kiki Cash Specially packaged so that it can't be used otherwise! Kiki
The packaging is so worth the effort, Kiki
Kiki, that's right
Even the packaging is done with care, with love and sincerity.
Is there anyone around you who recently gave birth?
Well, I don't think there have been any recently.
There are friends who have a hard time raising children.
I also have a friend who is getting married soon.
I think that's true in all the big and small things in life. Nothing is easy.
Yeah, but have you seen the pictures of your friends' babies?
It's so healing.
At that moment, it felt really good.
Even if you just blink, you're pretty and Kiki
They are really having a hard time ㅠㅠ
When I see such pretty babies, I go oh my gosh ㅠㅠ
There are many people who say that married life is difficult.
I guess friends who have fantasies about married life have a harder time.
Oh, I think that's exactly right. When you get married, things don't end like that...
I want to live a life that seems like a flower path and like a drama every day, but the reality is...war
Yeah... I think going from being boyfriend and girlfriend to becoming a couple is a lot different than I thought.
It's a compromise, but if we don't dislike each other, it seems like it'll be smooth sailing... But I guess I'm saying this because I'm not experienced. Kiki
Right...?
But I think it's important to have a good fit and consideration is also important.
Just because we have similar personalities doesn't mean there won't be any incidents in our married life, as I see from my friends.
Oh really?
It may not always be good.
Rather, they say that they are so similar that they cannot be reconciled.
Oh, it's a pain if we fight each other?
These days, there are things like cakes among dog food and snacks! It's amazing.
Wow, is there something like that? Kiki
I guess you have to be very careful about feeding your pets.
Starting with organic, the ingredients are those that dogs can eat, but they look exactly like what people eat.
Ahh Kiki where is that
I think I saw it in the video Kiki
I'm raising my cousin's dog, and at one point he swallowed a chicken bone... I was so shocked...
Chicken bones are not good.
Anything made of bone won't work, right?
Are there any big bones?
I heard that chicken bones are really dangerous?
If you chew on it and eat it, it can damage your organs.
Heh heh... This is really dangerous...
They are like family pets... so we have to be careful.
That's right, so the family watched the dog in case he behaved strangely. Kiki
That's right... I've never raised a dog, but when I see a program with a dog, I think that's what I should do...
You need to treat me with your interest and love.
Have you ever raised a hamster when you were young? Kiki
I raised it for a short time when I didn't know anything...with my younger sibling
Ah Kiki, I think I've raised a lot of chicks and hamsters.
But I don't think they all lived long ㅠㅠ
I kept raising it, but my mom said it smelled like a rat and let it out of the house...
Oh, it's such a realistic but slightly sad story... I heard there are people who even raise spiders these days.
A spider?
How do you put that in?
That's why
I just hate it...
Did you watch baseball yesterday?
Yes, I think I started watching it around episode 6.
I was watching it for a while, knowing I would win... and then... this...
Once I saw it, I couldn't stop...
Baseball is really fun when you win, but you end up passing around score reports. Kiki
I want to watch volleyball soon...
Seriously... I wish they would just play women's volleyball after seeing that first baseman not stepping on base Kiki
That's right, the pitcher was really good, but then he started to waver ㅠㅠ
Do you like any other sports?
I also like watching table tennis!
Oh table tennis! That's right.
I played table tennis for the first time and it was fun. Have you tried Kiki?
I'm really bad at ball games, but I want to try heady, which is similar to table tennis!
Kiki Oh wow, I think you'll be fine if you just have a little bit of athleticism!
Kiki I wish I had a little more natural athletic ability. Kiki
Kiki, don't you like exercising?
I did taekwondo when I was a student, and now I like weight training...
I want to do something but I don't have time... I'm depressed
That's right ㅠㅠ I think you have to keep doing exercise and find it fun!
I also want to go to Pilates, but I don't have the time yet.
Ah, that thing! It looks so hard.
It's a bit static, so I think it'll be difficult.
They say you sweat a lot, but you can't even keep your posture.
Do you know a lot about game types?
Well, I don't really know because I don't play games, but I saw on gaming sites in the past that there were a lot of different ones?
I enjoyed that. Spot the Difference Kiki
Oh! I'm also really bad at finding pictures, so I gathered my friends and played with them. Kiki
Ah Kiki, there's that too.
Finding the same picture! Good for improving memory.
Yes Kiki
I have an old Nintendo at home, and I sometimes play things like that to help me focus.
Kiki, when you really have nothing better to do, you play games...
: But when you travel, playing board games is a good way to foster friendship.
Yes Kiki, even though they are heavy, there are times when you can carry a few Kiki Jenga?
Yes yes Kiki, it's simple but fun. I used to play it a lot in the Tetris arcade.
There's nothing better than competing in two-player mode Kiki
I guess you went to the arcade often?
I think I went there often when I was in elementary school. I didn't even know much about Tekken, but I just watched it.
Ah Kiki, you're using the same technique as me by pressing the button
Kiki, that's right, it's a finishing move, and as if I discovered it, Kiki suddenly summons memories
I think I did this a lot with my younger sister Kiki, stacking up Kiki coins.
Oh Kiki, you didn't buy it at the arcade, did you?
I think it's okay to say that Kiki lived and pumped up when he grew up.
Wow pump! I used to be a DD before and I want to do that.
Where are you going during your break this time?
I want to go on a trip.
I want to leave if it weren't for the exam.
I wonder where I should go after my exams are over... I want to see the ocean!
Yes, you are. When it's over, you have to compensate unconditionally, so let's go on a trip to a nearby place! Where are you going in the country?
I want to go to Taean sometime.
Oh, if you go towards Taean, the sunset will be really beautiful.
Yes Kiki
There was a pension built on the cliff side of the coast.
Oh my, is that a cliff?
The view looks really good, but it's scary. Something like Kiki
It's a little scary. There's a cliff right below.
It's nice to see from afar Kiki
You should take a lot of photos like that when you travel and leave them as a part of your life.
Kiki photo is a must
Take a photo of each type Kiki
Oh, it seems like you know a lot, Kiki.
It's probably still difficult to go abroad.
Even if you have a vaccination certificate, it will probably be difficult to travel abroad without self-quarantine.
Oh, I see ㅠㅠ
I still can't even imagine going abroad.
There are still so many places in Korea I want to go to.
There are still many places to go in Korea, many places I don't know about, and money and time are the issues.
If I had money and time, I would go anywhere and do anything Kiki
I heard that there's a place overseas where it's so cold that it's a mess, but I don't remember where...
Oh really, recently? Kiki
I hate the cold so much.
What kind of weather do you like?
I, on the contrary, really like the cold Kiki
Oh, you like cold weather.
Do you like rain?
I love watching the rain when I'm indoors lol
Oh me too!
I love spending a lot of time in that cafe and watching the rain fall outside the window Kiki
As expected, everyone's heart is the same, Kiki
Kiki, I liked snow when I was little, but I hated it when I was driving.
Oh. You have to give up driving when it snows... Your heart really starts to spin when the wheels spin.
Spraying that on the tire won't help if the condition is severe, right?
Yesㅠㅠ You have to do it with a chain.
I remember going on a long distance trip before and it was really hard. Kiki was reckless.
It's completely impossible for me, who just got my license to drive a closet.
Kiki You have to be careful driving when the wind blows.
A light car might fly
Oh, my car is going to fly...
Even if a typhoon blows, it's whirring
Kiki But on days when the weather is bad, it's safer to stay inside a car...
They said that a man in Seocho-gu kept appearing at the same time and was caught by the police.
Wow, I heard that happens a lot in residential areas at night! Right?
That's right! He said he filmed more than 10 times with women.
No, how is that possible outside?
No, seriously, it's creepy to think that they filmed that while walking around normally
It's scary to think what kind of face that would really look like.
Not long ago, there was an incident on the subway in the morning where someone threatened someone with a weapon and attempted to sexually assault them.
No, really, the world is ending. I don't understand why people do this.
He really is a person without common sense.
It's ridiculous how Kiki would act like that on the subway.
I really wonder what kind of thoughts lead to that kind of life.
Could it be because of a mental disorder?
Right? I can't understand it because it's not a common idea.
It's true that social incidents and accidents are truly out of the ordinary.
I feel really bad because I see so many crimes against women.
Yeah, I guess I should bring one too. I'm scared...
Each local government should be given a self-defense weapon...
Kiki, that really seems like a good idea.
There are a lot of assaults without asking questions.
When I see things like that, I feel so sad that I have no choice but to protect myself.
Right, then you really have to be strong both physically and mentally.
Watching the news today, there was a huge fire in Greece!
Oh really?
There's been a lot of news about forest fires these days. Is it because of the weather? There was a big forest fire in Türkiye too.
It's been going on for 8 days...
Huh! It's not off yet? How...
I didn't know that either, but I found out while watching the Olympics...
It's the end of July and I still haven't caught it...
Wow. It must have been big news, why didn't I see it?
me too.
I feel like I missed something because I've only been skimming through the news lately.
Forest fires are a real disaster.
What about the animals that lived there...
Yes, I think it would have been even more difficult for animals to avoid.
Wildfires also spread incredibly quickly.
Was it Australia back then? Where the bushfires broke out and a bunch of koalas died? Do you remember?
Oh really? ㅠㅠ
I haven't seen it
But I think the damage is more serious because the weather is dry.
Is it because the dry wind is blowing up and it is unable to continue to evolve?
Yeah, that's right
How nice it would be if it rained!
Really?
It rains more than it takes to spread it out by helicopter...
Have you seen the Greek temperature?
I think I saw in the article that it was 47.1 degrees ㅠㅠ
WHAT? 47.1 degrees? That's the temperature I've seen in a sauna.
I doubted my eyes, wondering if that was the right temperature.
I feel like I hardly ever wear makeup these days because of the mask.
I think it's really like that on weekends.
Are you taking extra care of your skin because of the mask?
I'm focusing on moisturizing, but I can't help but get pimples...
I'm starting to get them one by one now.
I guess I can't help it since I have to keep wearing the mask indoors.
I think the world would be happier if we didn't have to wear masks...
Yeah, that's right
Kiki... I only want to put on eye makeup
I want to get my eyebrows tattooed again
If I get my eyebrows tattooed, is it permanent?
It's semi-permanent.
Depending on the person doing it, the color that remains is different.
I also want to get eyelash extensions in the summer.
If you're extending it, you're sticking it on, but won't it hurt?
It doesn't hurt, Kiki
But when it falls, it tickles me so badly.
So if you just rub it, it just falls off Kiki
Wow, how much does it cost for one procedure?
Something really cheap like 30,000 won?
And there are different price ranges Kiki
I remember being really interested in my appearance in my early 20s.
Once you do it, you have to take good care of it.
that's right
I think I need to choose my medicine carefully.
Oh, the adhesive strength varies a lot depending on the medicine.
Yeah Kiki, I have to go and do it sometime soon.
Do you have any personal insurance other than health insurance?
I have car and driver insurance, and it's integrated with actual expenses.
Aha, I have car insurance, 2 driver's insurance, medical expenses, life insurance?
Oh, there are many
But everyone said that there should be a Sylvie.
Did you borrow the car from someone you know?
I already have insurance with Silbi and life insurance, so it's the same insurance company.
Ahhh, I put it in through an acquaintance, but then I looked into it directly and it was much cheaper, so I put it in directly. Insurance Kiki
That's right! It's easier and more convenient to do it with an app than with a designer.
Right?
Once I did that, I was able to choose all the guarantees there and it was fine.
Kiki: People who are older say that it's easier to have a designer to explain things like membership.
Yes, and also, if you are healthy, you don't really need insurance, but you can't always be healthy...
I've seen so many people cancel their insurance and then get into an accident the next day.
Oh my gosh... I feel so bad.
I think it would be really unfair if something like that happened.
Even if an illness suddenly occurs,
I think insurance is something you really need to prepare for in advance.
That's right, that's right
Seriously! It would be nice to have insurance in case you need treatment suddenly.
These days, there is also overlapping compensation, so if you have insurance that allows overlapping, you can get more compensation.
Oh, there's something like that?
I think I also need to look into insurance very carefully.
Do you often use online shopping malls?
Yeah yeah I think most people are like that?
Even eating is done online these days.
Isn't there a difference in price?
That's right! I've been looking at it a lot on my phone, so I think you can buy it at a cheaper price if you buy it through the app, and there are a lot of coupons.
That's right, those coupons are secretly quite useful!
There are places where you can get a lot more benefits if you buy online, so it's very important to gather information.
It seems like you can buy it cheaply and get a lot of benefits because the link is shared on SNS.
Yes, fresh, next day delivery... the best Kiki
They arrived at dawn.
Oh, so if I order before 12 o'clock, it will be delivered before 7 in the morning?
Yes yes! I ordered before 11am and got a KakaoTalk message saying it arrived at 2am... Awesome
Wow, when it comes to shopping, fast delivery is a really good thing for consumers!
If you get that level of service, you'll be satisfied, Kiki
The price is also satisfactory!
Don't you also choose by looking at the trading volume?
That's right! I look at reviews, but the first thing I look at is the transaction volume or sales volume!
Me too! These days, when I order food delivery, I look at the order of the number of orders rather than the reviews.
I don't write reviews often, so it was definitely delicious, but I was lazy and forgot, so I wrote Kiki.
Oh me too...
When I'm really feeling good, I tend to leave it Kiki
I often hesitate at the shopping mall and end up choosing
I got tired of thinking about buying it so I didn't buy it... I didn't buy it but it felt like I bought it Kiki
Kiki, I feel that way a lot too, I can relate

I think I also often repeat one song these days.
Among those cartoons, wasn't that 101 Puppies that was made into a movie?
Oh, that's Cruella, right?
I really wanted to see that
At first I was like what is this, but then I saw the hairstyle and I knew it was Kiki
Kiki, you're really a perfect match
Looking at the poster, I really want to see the visuals of the actors
That female actress was also in Spiderman, right?
Ah, I think that's right...
I'm not sure, but Kiki
Do you like musical movies?
Oh! Among the music movies, I like Dreamgirls. Kiki
Oh, it was fun, I think there are a lot of movies with really good OSTs
That's right~
That Begin Again?
That sounds good too!
Yesㅠㅠ It's still on my playlist so I listen to it every day.
So good!
I think OST songs are more memorable.
It reminds me of a scene from the movie, but Kiki
that's right!
That scene definitely had an impact, like in La La Land.
That evening I was looking for a car with keys!
Ah, I want to see you again
How many times have I seen this! Kiki
I don't think I'll ever get tired of watching it.
I want to see it again in the theater!
I wish they would re-release those movies!
What are you going to eat for lunch today?
Kiki, I'm going to eat bibimbap today
Have you decided?
I'm going to eat kimbap for lunch today!
Oh, Kimbap! What kind of Kimbap is it?
I'm having tuna kimbap today!
Are you near a bibimbap restaurant?
Oh tuna kimbap!
Um, it's not far, maybe 7 or 8 minutes from here Kiki
Are you going to eat kimbap and rest in the break room today?
Yeah! It's too hot today, I don't want to go out Kiki
Are you going to drink coffee too?
Yeah, it's been so hot since this morning!
I'm thinking about coffee Kiki
What are you going to drink this afternoon?
Yeah, I'm going to drink iced americano!
I think I won't fall asleep in the afternoon Kiki
Do you like coffee?
I don't feel sleepy if I eat in the afternoon ㅠ
I can't drink coffee because caffeine doesn't suit me ㅠ
The coffee smells good, but my heart starts pounding when I drink it.
Oh, coffee doesn't suit you!
There are quite a few people who don't tolerate caffeine.
Yes, the coffee smells good, but it's a shame I can't drink it ㅠ
They say that coffee tastes different depending on how you make it?
Yeah, that's right. It's amazing how each coffee has a different scent and taste!
Then, do you have a favorite drink other than coffee?
Oh I like chocolate drinks and matcha fruit drinks too Kiki
Where do you drink coffee most often?
These days, I often go to Ten Percent near my company! It's delicious and cheap!
I recommend you go there next time too!
Oh, right there, I got it!
What do you consider most when looking for a house?
Well, check if it's near a subway station, if it's on a high floor, and if the bathroom is clean.
What do you see?
Yeah, I'll check the bathroom first!
Kiki: I think that if the bathroom is clean, the house as a whole feels clean.
What type of house do you live in?
Yeah I totally agree Kiki
Well, later on I want to live in a house and live quietly Kiki
What kind of house do you want to live in?
I want to live in an apartment in a quiet neighborhood Kiki
My main home is a house, but it's too hard to manage.
Oh, right.
They say you have to be diligent to buy a house...Kiki
A quiet apartment might be a good choice Kiki
Did you always live in a house when you were young?
Yeah, I lived in a house ever since I was little and before I started living on my own!
And the house was full of bugs.
Oh, a bug...ㅠ
But is it good that the residential area is quiet? Kiki
Yeah, that's right!
I like it when the house is quiet!
I think life will be good if I just work hard!
Have you ever lived in a house?
Yeah, I lived at my grandmother's house when I was little, so I lived in a house at that time Kiki
If you live in a house, it's good because you don't have to wait for the elevator and you can go out right away. Thinking about it now, Kiki
Yeah, that sounds really good, Kiki
Is there anything you want to try when you buy a house?
If I live in a house with a terrace or yard, I want to go out and get some fresh air and sit still and watch the weather.
What's it like to live in a real house? Check the weather and stuff
It comes in well and the atmosphere is especially good on rainy days!
Oh good! Just thinking about it makes me feel relaxed Kiki
Yes, invite me next time you live in a house!
Yeah, okay, good!
Do you use public transportation a lot?
Yeah, I don't have a car, so I use public transportation a lot.
you?
Yeah me too!
Do you usually take the subway or the bus?
I prefer taking the bus, but I only take the subway when I'm commuting to and from work.
Don't you get motion sickness when you ride a bus or something?
Yeah! I don't get motion sickness!
Are you good at riding boats or planes?
It's really nice not to have motion sickness...
I'm good at flying, but it's not easy to ride a boat.
how about you?
Yeah, I rather like riding a boat!
I feel so cool, Kiki
Do you have a car you want to buy later?
It's cool outside! Kiki
I want to buy a Volvo later!
you?
Oh Volvo is great!
I'm a matte Benz!
I saw the commercial and it was so cool and pretty!
Oh, is that Benz new?
Yeah, I guess so
It looks better because it's matte Kiki
Do you know how to ride a bike?
Yeah ride a bike Kiki
Are you good at riding?
Yeah, I'm not very good at riding either, but I still like riding!
Want to go to the Han River and ride a bike next time?
Oh yeah good! Kiki
How about going around October?
Okay, let's go in October!
Yeah, yeah, good!
Was there a part-time job you wanted to try?
I am Cafe Alba Kiki
What do you have?
I wanted to try working at a ski resort in the winter Kiki
Why did you want to try opening a cafe?
Cafe Alba, the atmosphere was good and it seemed like it would be fun to make it. Kiki
Why did you want to work at a ski resort?
I just wanted to try it because I heard that it can only be done in the winter and that it's something that college students usually do a lot!
And doesn't that sound fun?
Yeah right Kiki
I think it's a good thing to do during the vacation. After work, go skiing! Have you done a lot of part-time jobs?
Yeah, I did it a lot when I was in college!
you?
I haven't tried many.
So now that I think about it, I feel a little sorry. Kiki
It's hard to find a part-time job these days because of Corona.
That's right. I heard that it's hard to find a part-time job these days because of the coronavirus.
How is going to work these days?
I'm used to the company, it's routine Kiki
Is there anything difficult about working at the company?
Yeah, I still think waking up in the morning is the hardest part, Kiki.
you?
Ah, that's still hard for me too Kiki
I can't adapt. How many people are there in that company?
I think there are about 30 people Kiki
How is your company?
I think we're similar too Kiki
Not too much, not too little, just right
thank god!
Even if we're tired, let's fight!
Yeah, you too, fighting!
Military leave restrictions due to Corona!
what do you think about it?
I guess it's an inevitable measure since it's a place where people live in groups, but it's also a bit disappointing. ㅠ
They say there are soldiers who enlisted and never came out.
I'm really upset ㅠㅠ
I bet you're really looking forward to your vacation!
Have you ever tried military food?
Something like a military base!
Yeah, no
I haven't tried it.
Have you tried it?
Have you ever eaten something like the combat rations sold at the military PX?
It was amazing
These days, military programs are so popular that it seems like they're easy to find!
Oh, how did it taste?
Yeah, it was better than I thought, but the taste was a bit strange!
There's a popular variety show called Steel Troops these days. Have you seen it?
I've only heard of it!
Are you training like a real man?
It's a program where representatives from various units come out and compete!
It's interesting that there seem to be a lot of military programs after Real Man!
Oh right, I think there was something with a military concept on YouTube too, Kiki
Yeah, I think there are a lot of different ones coming out these days!
Now that it's become so popular, the treatment of soldiers should also improve!
At least give me some food.
The burden will be less since the service period has been shortened, right?
Maybe so?
But these days, I'm glad that it's getting better and better because they say you can use your cell phone too.
right?
Yeah, that's right
I think I can somewhat lessen my regret about not being able to go on vacation since I can at least use my cell phone.
Yes, I hope that the treatment of soldiers will get better and better in the future!
Yeah, I hope so.
Did you ever go to an academy when you were young?
Yeah, yeah, I went to a comprehensive academy. Kiki
Where have you been?
I've only ever played the piano! Kiki
Is there an academy you wanted to go to?
When I was young, I wanted to go to ballet school, but I couldn't. Kiki
Is there an academy you wanted to go to?
Yeah, I want to learn Aikido!
There was a Hapkido school in my neighborhood, and I was envious every time I passed by Kiki
Oh, Hapkido. When I was young, I did Hapkido and Taekwondo a lot. If you look at it, Kiki
Is Hapkido like Kendo?
It looked a bit similar to Taekwondo, but the Hapkido uniform was black, so it looked cool! Kiki
Have you ever seen the drama Sky Castle? It's about private education and it's amazing.
Oh no, I haven't seen Sky Castle
But it's so famous that it appears everywhere, so I know the general content!
But I think that kind of story actually happens
That's right!
They say that Gangnam area in particular is amazing.
I know someone who is a private academy instructor and he said he has a great passion for learning.
There is a school district called 8 in Gangnam, but isn't that there? It's a place with a lot of enthusiasm for school.
Yes! It will be in Gangnam.
I think our country's private education problem is serious.
These days, because of the coronavirus, classes are being held online, so the educational gap is getting worse!
Yeah, I heard that too.
They say that since they can't go to school, they're all being forced into private education.
That's what I'm saying
We need to find a solution to our country's education problem quickly.
That's right, but I don't think private education will decrease for the time being.
That's what I'm saying
I hope this gets resolved quickly and in a good way!
Yeah, that would be great.
Since I live alone, I miss my family a lot!
Do you see each other often?
No, I don't get it often, but I still see Kiki once every two weeks.
how about you?
I live far away, so I only see him on holidays!
So instead, call often! Kiki
Do you video call often? Kiki
No, I only do video calls occasionally when I want to see my dog Kiki
But don't you think our relationship is getting better because we live apart?
Yeah, that's a bit like that Kiki
It's also sad, you too? Kiki
Yeah, when we were together, we fought over trivial things, but now that we're apart, I think we're getting along better, Kiki.
Do you plan on living with your family again?
If I work near my house, I think we'll live together again
But once I lived alone, I felt comfortable being alone Kiki
you?
Yeah me too Kiki
I miss my family but I like living alone so much and it's comfortable Kiki
Later on, I want to live nearby, not in the same house.
Kiki that's okay too
But what if your mom isn't upset?
Mom gets upset sometimes, but I think she's used to it now.
When I call, Kiki, you seem a little annoyed and tell me to hang up because you're busy.
Kiki, it was like that at first, but it's getting better.
When I talk to my mom on the phone, I just ask how she's doing and then hang up right away.
I guess time passes and everything becomes like that! Kiki
But as time goes by, I think it's best for the family to be healthy
That's right, since I'm outside, I'm most worried about my health!
I feel at ease when my parents are healthy.
Yeah, I think that's true
Let's take care of our health and take good care of our parents!
Yeah, let's do that!
At what age do you want to get married?
I want to do it before I turn 35, as long as I have a stable job.
you?
I wanted to do it when I was over 35, around 37!
Is there any special reason?
I'm comfortable living alone now, so I want to hang out with my friends more and do it later if possible, but I want to do it before I turn 40.
Do you have a lot of friends getting married these days?
Oh, right, I can't live like this once I get married!
Yeah, a lot of my friends are getting married and everyone around me is getting married.
Aren't you like that too?
Yeah right Kiki
I have a lot of friends who are married now, so I often go to weddings, but I heard that these days, it's difficult to get married because of the coronavirus.
That's right, weddings these days are a sight that was unimaginable in the past.
Wearing a mask and taking pictures, and even at the banquet hall
Yes, that's right!
So I guess the trend these days is to simplify things!
Is anyone in your family married?
Yeah my cousins are married too and almost half of them are Kiki
you?
I feel like I'm almost half married now Kiki
Don't your parents pressure you to get married?
Yeah, yeah, you did it for a while in your late 20s, but you don't do it anymore.
What did your parents say?
Yeah, I didn't say anything until now, but after my sister got married, she suddenly started talking. Kiki
I'm sad because I feel like I'm already at an age where I should be getting married...
Right, marriage seemed like a distant dream, but I'm already that age... ㅠ
When it's time to go, we'll all go, Kiki
don't cry
Okay Kiki
Let's meet good people and go happily whenever we really want to!
Yeah, definitely do that!
Have you ever seen Animal Farm?
Yeah, I saw that in elementary school!
When I look at it, there are so many animals that are so pitiful ㅠㅠ
That's right ㅠㅠ I still see it often these days, and there are still a lot of pitiful animals!
In particular, there are many dogs that were abandoned as companion dogs and end up wandering the streets ㅠㅠ
Oh right, if you look at that, there are a lot of stories about rescuing abandoned or stray dogs ㅠ They look so sick ㅠㅠ
Have you ever seen a rescue?
Yeah, the last thing I saw was a story about a dog that was abandoned at a highway rest stop and ran to a car that looked like its owner's car. It was so sad.
ㅠㅠ I really wonder what the owner will think when he sees that ㅠㅠ
They say that even if an abandoned dog is adopted, it takes some time for them to adjust because of the aftereffects.
That's right, that's right!
Wouldn't things be better in our country if we made it mandatory for children to receive education and insurance before they are raised like other countries?
Yeah, I think they really need to receive that kind of education so they can raise their children as responsible family members.
When I see people throwing things away, I think they think of them as possessions!
That's what I'm saying!
I saw an article yesterday that said that the number of abandoned animals is increasing after the COVID vaccination.
What does this have to do with vaccination?
He said that he adopted the dog because he was bored when he was just at home, and after he got vaccinated and was able to go outside, he spent less time at home!
Is it really that bad?
How could you think like that!
bad!
When I see something like that, I want to try volunteering for abandoned dogs.
Do you want to go sometime when you have time?
Do you happen to know if there's one nearby?
No, I'll look it up and let you know!
When is a good time for you?
Anytime is fine with me on weekends!
Yeah, then I'll look for a place that's open this weekend!
Did you happen to watch the volleyball quarterfinals yesterday?
Yeah yeah, I was really touched ㅠㅠ
Did you see it too?
Yeah, I was really nervous!
I was really upset when I got a red card!
Have you ever received a red card?
I didn't see that scene!
For what reason?
I got a red card for protesting strongly to the referee!
Isn't this really ridiculous?
Oh really?
What the red card!
If you get a red card, do you have to play at a disadvantage?
No, strangely enough, there are no ejections in volleyball!
Instead, a deal is made where the opposing team gets 1 point and the right to receive!
I just found out yesterday too
Isn't it amazing?
Oh really, I just found out about this!
I think it's also lucky to meet a really good referee during a match!
Yeah, I was really upset yesterday
Still, I'm so glad we won
Do you know when the semi-finals are?
No I don't know the date Kiki
When it was time to do it, I checked the article and Kiki
Do you know when?
Yeah I know Kiki
One on Friday night at 7pm!
If it's Friday, is it tomorrow evening?
Yeah, that's right. I think it would be perfect if I order some chicken after work tomorrow?
That's really nice to see after work Kiki
There's going to be a chicken riot tomorrow Kiki
Where are you going to see it?
I'm going to get off work early and watch it comfortably at home! Are you going to do the same?
Yeah, I'm going to do that too!
Let's cheer hard tomorrow!
There are a lot of fun games on entertainment shows these days.
Have you ever seen it?
I used to watch it on MuDo or Running Man, but I don't know about Kiki these days.
Was there anything you wanted to try?
Yeah, these days there's a game called Hunminjeongeum where if you use English while playing table tennis or something like that, you get 0 points. It's a really fun game with a good concept!
Oh, this would be a great game to play on Hangeul Day.
It would be fun if several people did it. Kiki
Are you good at board games?
I'm not good at board games, but I like them!
I think things like Blue Marble that I used to play as a child are still fun these days!
Kiki, do you have a favorite board game?
Ah, you did a lot of blue marbles Kiki
I like Halli Galli the best Kiki
I'm not good at games either, but this is easy to do!
Have you ever tried it?
Yeah I like Halli Galli too!
There are a lot of fun games on entertainment shows these days.
I think Halligalli requires quick reflexes Kiki
Have you ever tried playing Lumicube?
Ah, I tried Lumicube
Was that a game of brain battle?
Yeah, matching numbers and colors! You have to use your head and be quick-witted, but it seems so fun Kiki
Have you ever been to a board game room?
Oh right, I've been to the Kiki board game room before.
There are many types of games, and I enjoyed trying out games I didn't know about.
Have you been there?
Yeah, there are so many different types of games! These days, there are a lot of games like mobile games, but I think I like board games better than those. Kiki
Which do you like better?
I also find real games more fun than mobile games Kiki
Could it be a little more lively?
Oh right Kiki
I think it's more fun if we all look at each other's faces Kiki
Do you want to go to a board game room together next time?
Yeah, okay
Are there any places to visit nearby?
Yeah, there's a really big and clean place in my neighborhood!
Let's go together this weekend!
There are a lot of fun games on entertainment shows these days.
I want to travel more because of Corona
Which of your travel destinations was your favorite?
I liked Paris Kiki
I wanted to go again because I was there for a short time!
Where did you like the best?
The place I liked the most was Pai!
I was there for about a week and it felt incredibly free.
Hey, where's your brother?
Oh, bye, it's Thailand Kiki
It feels like a really small town, but it's the number one choice for backpackers.
But I think I know why!
What do you remember most about Paris?
The European architecture that I had only seen on TV, and the atmosphere and night view were so pretty!
When you went to Pai, did you go backpacking?
Yeah, it was really free and comfortable!
I saw an elephant walking down the street on a scooter and went to a hot spring in the forest!
Be sure to go next time!
Is there a place you would like to travel to in the future?
Oh good!
I want to see that city in Vietnam, Mui Ne!
Kiki is a resort that Koreans don't know much about.
Where do you want to go?
Oh, I think I've heard of Mui Ne!
I want to go to Egypt
I've never been to a desert before so it's going to be really exciting!
Is there a city in Korea you would like to visit?
In Korea, I want to go to the southern sea
Kiki, a city like Yeosu that I've only heard of in songs
Are there any direct flights to Egypt?
Hey there!
There aren't many, but there are some!
It's hard to go these days because of Corona, but I definitely want to go when Corona is gone.
When Corona is gone, will you go to Egypt first? Kiki
No, I'm saving Egypt for when I have more travel experience!
Once the coronavirus is gone, I'm planning to go to Jeju Island first so I can go there quickly!
Do you have plans?
I haven't been yet, but if I could, I'd like to go to Southeast Asia Kiki
Is Egypt a bit difficult to travel to on your own?
No, I heard that these days, a lot of people go on independent trips!
I hope the coronavirus goes away soon!
Traveling is better when you are free! Kiki
That would be nice.
Isn't the weather too hot today?
Yeah, it was so hot since morning.
How was your sleep?
Yeah, it's still too hot to sleep, so I always turn on the fan and sleep.
you?
Yeah, yeah, I also turn on the fan and the air conditioner once in a while.
I keep getting texts telling me to be careful of the heat wave these days.
Yeah, it rained a lot last summer, but this year it seems like it's just too hot.
Will it be this hot for another month or two?
Yeah, I think it'll probably continue like this until September.
Last year or so?
Have you heard of Daefrica? Kiki
Yeah, that's right Kiki. If you watch the news back then, there was something about frying eggs on asphalt Kiki.
I guess it feels really hot
Wow, fried eggs, what are you talking about Kiki?
It's a blessing to be able to work without being affected by the weather. Kiki
Yeah, it's so hot these days, so I think it's okay to stay in an office with the air conditioning on, Kiki
When I got home from work, it was so hot that I had a hard time.
That's right! Can you turn on the air conditioner at home by linking it to your cell phone?
I've never done it before!
I don't think it'll work Kiki
Does your home air conditioner have that function?
No, not my house... Kiki
So you have to turn it on as soon as you get there...
If that happens, I'll feel really good as soon as I get in, Kiki
That's what I'm saying
How nice would it be if it could be cool as soon as you step inside?
These days, when I get home, the first thing I do is turn on the air conditioner. Kiki
Yeah me too Kiki
Kiki, I'm looking for the remote control
Now, when winter comes, you won't even think about this hot weather, right?
Yeah, that's right, but I wish summer would go by quickly now!
Yeah, that would be great.
I think the problem of school violence is so serious these days!
Right, did you see the article about the national athletes? Sister
Yeah, it was really bad
How can friends who work out together do that?
These days, even celebrities have problems because of school violence.
So it's too serious to say it was something I did because I was young and immature.
I think the victims' trauma must be really big!
So, I saw an article recently that said that it wasn't something that could be done when you were young!
I think the punishment should be a bit stronger. What do you think?
Yeah, that's right. I think it would be good to revise the law a bit.
There are also some teenagers who believe that and think crime is easy.
Yeah, I think they're acting recklessly because they think they won't be punished anyway.
Recently, I saw a case of suicide due to school violence in Gwangju and it made me feel so bad.
ㅠㅠ I wonder how difficult it must have been for a young child to endure it alone.
Many students who are bullied at school are unable to tell their parents and endure it alone for fear of being retaliated against.
That's what I mean
It makes me so angry and sad to see articles like that, but I feel like they come out way too often!
These days, even elementary school students are suffering
These days, with the advancement of technology, there is cyberbullying and other forms of violence, even if it is not physical violence!
Yeah, that's what they said
Do you think it's unfair that perpetrators of school violence, like celebrities these days, are later revealed and suffer?
how is it?
Seeing that their livelihoods have come to a halt now, it seems like those people are becoming victims again, but I think they should accept it to some extent because it is something they did.
What do you think?
Yeah, I also think that if you think that the perpetrators were not punished when they were young and are punished when they grow up, you shouldn't feel wronged, but reflect on your actions first!
I think I think that way more these days because there are so many problems.
That's right. The problem is that instead of reflecting on what you did, you claim that you are also a victim!
But there are also people who defend those people.
Yeah, I think it creates a lot of problems again
I hope that in the future, there will be clear legal solutions to resolve this issue!
I hope something gets resolved quickly.
Have you seen the articles about the democracy movement in Myanmar these days?
Yeah, I saw it. They were doing such a horrible thing to those protesting citizens.
Yeah, it was really bad
I was so shocked to see them shooting and hitting little children!
That's right, after seeing that, Korean reporters also said that it was similar to our May 18th incident!
When I watched the video, it was really similar. I wish the international community would help quickly, but it seems they are reluctant to step forward.
Yes, I think it's right to resolve it within that country. And I don't think the government there will listen to me.
Yeah, it was a total dictatorship.
I feel like it's flowing very similarly to the 80s in our country.
This needs to be resolved quickly, you know?
Yeah, Southeast Asia seems a bit dictatorial!
Was Thailand communist too?
Well, Thailand has a king, so isn't it different from communism?
Ah, there's a king. It's unfamiliar!
Speaking of protests, I heard that there is also a no-mask movement happening these days due to the coronavirus.
The no-mask movement seems so dangerous. Do those people not believe in corona?
I guess he thinks he won't get caught even if he doesn't use it
But what's funny is that I saw the pictures of the protest, and it was a no-mask movement, but there were people wearing masks. Kiki
Kiki, are you just rebelling? Kiki
The world is really big and there are many unique things, Kiki
Yes, there was a man in China who pickpocketed and ran away from the police. He went somewhere in a hurry and it was a police station. Kiki
How surprised would you be? Kiki, there are so many different things to do. Kiki
I should watch some world news like you!
Yeah, just take a look!
Do you like getting your nails done?
Yeah, I'm not very good at it now, but I do it often because it makes me feel good after doing it.
you?
I'm not good at it now, but I do it often because it makes me feel good after doing it.
I also try to receive it sometimes, although not often, as a mood changer, and I feel really good after receiving it!
Is there a shop you would recommend?
Well, I don't have a regular shop.
I do it at home
These days, you can do it yourself! Have you ever seen an advertisement for self-adhesive nails?
Yeah, these days it's easy to do it with glue-on nails!
It seems like technology is getting better and better!
It's expensive to go to the shop often, but I think it's a good idea!
That's right, every time I go to the shop and add something, it all costs money so it's expensive ㅠ
When you get your nails done, what color do you like?
I am red!
I like the color red so I think I wear it a lot in the summer Kiki
Do you have a favorite design or color?
Oh red!
I like shiny things more than the color Kiki
How about putting something like a part on your fingernail?
I found the parts a bit uncomfortable
I guess it's because I have a bit of a sloppy personality! Kiki
If you're used to not uploading, it's a bit uncomfortable Kiki
Are you going to get your nails done this summer?
Yeah, I'm planning on getting one before summer ends, but I haven't decided yet, Kiki.
you?
I don't know when I'll do it yet Kiki
Would it be better to do it in winter since the clothes are thicker in winter?
I think it's okay to receive it in the winter Kiki
It looks pretty even when you wear a knit
Oh right
Kiki, I've been seeing a lot of introductions of things like knit custom nails.
It would be pretty if it was red then.
Yeah, that's right! I want to do it again in the winter too!
Yeah, okay, good!
This week is a lucky week!
Are you going to eat samgyetang?
It's already Boknal
I have to eat! You are Kiki
Yeah, I'm planning to eat samgyetang this weekend!
Do you have any favorite health food?
Well, usually when you say it's hard, you eat some grilled pork belly or meat.
What do you eat?
Yeah me too!
When I'm really having a hard time, I feel like eating beef!
Kiki, eating beef makes me feel good
Do you like eel too?
I don't eat eel very often ㅠ
What part of beef do you like?
Oh, similar to me
I don't eat eel much either Kiki
All beef is good, but I like sirloin and ribs the best!
you?
Oh good
If you eat what suits you, it seems like you'll get what you want Kiki
I think I don't catch a cold as often because I wear a mask due to the coronavirus.
how about you?
Yeah, I used to catch a cold at least once every winter, but I haven't caught a cold since Corona!
Do you catch a cold easily?
Yeah, I catch colds easily too, but I'm fine this time. Kiki
Actually, the number of patients with the flu and cold has decreased after Corona.
Even after the coronavirus is over, I think it's a good idea to keep the habit of wearing a mask in the winter!
Yeah, I guess that's good because the air is cold!
And wash your hands and feet well Kiki
Yeah, I think washing your hands well is really important!
That's right, that's the easiest way to boost your immunity!
That's right, let's be careful and wash our hands well every day!
Yeah, definitely do that!
Do you usually buy clothes online?
Yeah, the internet is convenient, Kiki
you?
Yeah me too Kiki
These days, it seems convenient because you can see the details on the Internet, Kiki
Right, do you read reviews on the Internet?
Yeah, I usually read a lot of reviews before buying something. That way I have less chances of failure. Kiki
Do you have any specific questions about what to look for when buying online?
Yeah me too
When buying a one-piece dress, usually look at the length a lot.
If you buy it without checking the length, it will be too long or too short, so it will be a disaster.
What do you see?
Yeah, I also usually look at length the most...
These days, there are even things that allow you to set and view things according to your height.
Have you seen it?
Oh really?
You've gotten better lately, Kiki
I guess I'll have to set my height and see!
Have you ever bought shoes online?
Yeah, I buy shoes sometimes too
But since you don't know how to choose shoes unless you try them on, it's a bit hit and miss, Kiki
Have you bought it?
That's right. I also buy shoes that I wear often at the store, but I think I can buy comfortable shoes like sandals online too!
It seems like there are more pretty designs on the internet these days.
Yes, the design is pretty and they have sales more often than offline!
I got a discount so I can use the internet more
That's right! They give out more discount coupons especially on weekends!
Yes, marketing is really key to making people shop.
Right Kiki, if you find a place with lots of pretty products later, let me know!
Yeah, okay, I'll tell you!
I find it so amazing that old songs are making a comeback and becoming popular again these days!
Yes, many of those celebrities had a hard time before they made a comeback.
That's right, so when I see something that's going well, I feel proud and good for no reason Kiki
And these days, I see songs I used to like going up the music charts again, and it reminds me of the old days. Have you listened to them?
Yeah, yeah, I actually feel more at peace when I listen to old songs rather than new ones. Kiki
What kind of songs do you like?
I think I listen to more ballads than dance music Kiki
I like the OST too. What about you, Kiki?
I also listen to the OST often and sometimes when I feel like it, I listen to the dance to Kiki
Doesn't it make you more immersed when you watch a drama and listen to the songs in it?
Yeah, that's right. Sometimes, when I listen to the song, I think of scenes from the drama. Kiki
Are there any dramas you would recommend?
I haven't seen the drama, but there is a drama I want to see: Goblin Kiki
Have you seen the goblin?
Yeah goblin
I've seen it three times!
I recommend seeing it in winter!
Oh really? Kiki
Oh, that reminds me of scenes with lots of winter clothes. Kiki
Why do you like that drama?
I think it's a drama with more to think about than you might think, Kiki
Aside from the love story, there are a lot of stories about life with the grim reaper, and when I see those, I think a lot.
Oh, the script is really well written.
I didn't think about that because it was overshadowed by the actors' images, Kiki
Yeah, and it was fun because all the actors acted well!
Be sure to check it out in the winter!
Yeah, okay, I understand
Among those famous scenes, was the location Gangwon-do?
Yeah, that's right!
Let's go to the filming location together next time!
Yeah, okay, let's go
What genre of movies do you like?
I like Rocco
you?
I like romantic comedies and action movies too!
Something like Avengers or Star Trek!
Oh, have you seen the Black Widow that came out this time?
I haven't seen it yet
I haven't been able to go to the cinema since Corona. ㅠㅠ
Have you seen it?
Yeah, I saw it
Still, there weren't many people, so did you watch the entire Kiki Marvel series?
Yeah, I've seen almost everything!
Which romantic comedy movie is your favorite?
Oh, oh, I don't remember the whole romantic comedy right now, but I enjoyed watching The Notebook Kiki
Do you like romantic movies?
Yeah, I like it!
I enjoyed watching The Notebook too!
Among romance movies, I like About Time!
Ahh About Time is fun Kiki
The red dress is the most memorable poster Kiki
Yeah, that's right! I saw a wedding in the rain in that movie and I had a romantic idea of a wedding in the rain for a moment. Kiki
Kiki but if it's not a movie then it would be too cold in real life
Yeah, I think it looked cool because it was a Kiki movie. Kiki
Yeah, but since it's only once, a movie-like wedding is fine too Kiki
Try it again later!
Yeah! I think it would be nice to live like in the movies once!
I'll invite you when I do!
Yeah, yeah, good!
How about ordering delivery for lunch today?
It would be nice if the timing was right,
What would you like to order?
There's a delicious restaurant I discovered on my way to work.
If it's really close, wouldn't it be okay to go and eat there?
It's so hot outside, I think it would be better to order delivery.
great,
What's the menu like?
The name of the restaurant was **.
Do you know this place?
Yes, we go there often.
How about Gongcha for dessert?
Oh, good.
Seriously, let's go grab some lunch and go have some fun.
My favorite menu is taro milk tea with pearls added.
It's a classic route.
I don't think I'll live long if I drink chocolate milk tea with 100% sugar content.
I can't eat sweets well,
I started eating a little bit while working these days.
So, how about taking this opportunity to indulge in sweetness?
I like fresh things,
I can only handle mint chocolate.
Next time you get a chance, let's go have a glass of mint chocolate soju.
Then what should I eat as a side dish?
I wish the value of my house would go up a bit, but there is no development in my neighborhood.
Isn't there a new subway coming in?
It always happens in the direction of our house.
It takes more than 30 minutes to get there by bus.
That's a shame, I've become interested in interior design lately.
Do you like decorating your home?
I bought a shelf stand from the Today's Home app and the atmosphere of my house changed.
I also have today's house set up and look at it sometimes, but I also want to start living alone soon and decorate my house.
It's fun to see the number of furniture that suits my taste increasing.
I think a house looks prettier when it has a lot of gray and wood tones.
I want to try decorating it with a mix of completely white and bright red.
Decorating it extravagantly is also a good idea.
But right now, the room is so gloomy because of the soundproofing material that I want to tear it all out.
If there's soundproofing material, doesn't the room get really hot?
It's not that it's hot because there's soundproofing, but it just feels like the sound is being absorbed.
As for the interior, it's the worst.
Then you can hardly hear any sound coming from the other side?
What's that sound coming from the other side?
The sound is incredibly clear. There is no skipping.
I'm talking about sounds heard outside the room.
Are you interested in cars?
I don't know much about different types of cars because I'm not really interested in them.
I don't know much about cars, so I can't join in even when my friends talk about cars all the time.
I plan to take public transportation for the rest of my life.
You'll have to drive later anyway, is that okay?
In the future, public transportation will be more developed, but will it be necessary?
Won't only Seoul develop?
Before that, it seemed like our country would disappear
If Seoul develops, I will have to live in Seoul for the rest of my life.
You have to work hard to earn money.
I'm the only one around me who doesn't have a car, so I've been thinking about cars a lot these days.
There's also a saying that if you buy a car early, you won't be able to save money.
I'm not sure if a car is really necessary.
Whether you buy early or late, you can't collect them.
There's only one bus in my neighborhood.
Then it would be very inconvenient.
I'm so uncomfortable in my own neighborhood, but when I commute to work in another city, I feel like I want to tear everything down.
Then you probably don't even have a license
Yes, I don't have a driver's license, so I can't even ride an electric kickboard.
Oh, do I need a license to ride an electric kickboard too?
Electric motor license?
Yes, the law has changed now so you need a motorcycle license or a driver's license to ride one.
What is the longest part-time job you've had?
I think I worked part-time at a convenience store for over a year.
I also worked at a convenience store for one year and a PC room for another year, which was the longest I've worked in, but have you done anything else?
I've done a variety of things in short, like guiding parking, running a Korean restaurant, and delivering packages.
I've only worked in a few factories and service industries, but you've done a lot of different things.
Did you load and unload the truck as a delivery worker?
A while ago, a friend of mine went to Coupang and said it was really easy, so I went, but I got on the wrong train and just got on and off.
My friend also got on and off the train, but wasn't it easy because he was talented?
He was sorting things coming down from the rails.
Was it easy to get on and off?
That day I realized how heavy wet tissues were.
Then what about water instead of wet tissues?
I order bottled water every day, so the distribution center must be having a hard time.
Water seems really heavy...
I have no choice but to order it too.
Our company's contract period ends at the end of November, right?
Yes, I'm worried about where to find a job after the end of November.
I'm worried that I'll have to work without any gaps as much as possible.
Aren't you interested in broadcasting training?
I don't know because I haven't looked into it yet, but if the timing is right, it doesn't seem like a bad idea.
What was your position during your military service?
I was a battalion personnel administrative soldier.
Do all personnel officers participate in training?
Since it's a staff office, almost everyone has to participate and do work, so there are many cases where I put camouflage cream on my face and work in front of the computer.
Oh, you must have had a hard time. Did you work overtime too?
I'm probably the one who gets called out the most after work hours.
Are the administrative soldiers just chosen at random?
At first, I joined a combat unit, but then I was selected because there were no new administrative soldiers coming in.
I lived comfortably throughout my military service, so I don't have much to say when it comes to military life.
My body wasn't that tired, but I worked too much and got a herniated disc.
Isn't that incredibly hard on your body?
I think the military is successful as long as they don't get sick.
I think I've been sitting in a bad chair for too long.
I went and came away feeling like I was more normal than I thought.
There are a lot of people who are really curious about how I became an active soldier.
There are executives who get paid just for playing foot volleyball all day long.
Were there any major incidents while you were in the military?
There was a time when a person died.
I'm wondering if I should get a stenography certificate.
Since the difficulty level is easier than Korean shorthand, wouldn't it be okay to take it lightly next year?
There was only one test this year due to COVID, but I hope there will be more next year.
I passed the 3rd level of investigative shorthand, and I think I can pass a higher level next year.
Honestly, I think I can get a 2nd level now. Because of the transcription work I did this time.
Yes, that's right. And while I'm at it, I'm going to try for level 1 as well.
Are you preparing well for this Korean shorthand test?
The accuracy of level 1 is around 85%, so you should try as much as you can.
But I'm worried because I don't always get a level 2 stability.
It would be okay if I failed because I didn't have the skills, but it would be really disappointing if I slipped up on the day.
I was so nervous in the first half of this year that I failed level 2, and when it came time for the exam, I didn't do as well as usual.
I think the shorthand test is greatly affected by condition and luck.
I wish only the easy topics were included, as the content of Level 1 is sometimes easier than that of Level 2.
I think that level 1 is something that passes by quickly if you miss it for even a moment, so managing your concentration is important.
That's right, if you just sit there blankly for a moment, too much will fly away.
I feel relieved that I gave up on taking the exam this year though.
I want to get my license as soon as possible.
Aren't you interested in shorthand?
I think it would be okay if I didn't look at the notes, there are too many things I have to give up on.
By any chance, where are your parents from?
My father is from Chungcheong Province and my mother is from Jeolla Province.
Oh, my father is also from Chungcheong Province, haha
Down there is Chungnam
Are you on good terms with your family?
I'm a bit awkward with my younger sibling, but I get along well with my mom and dad.
I don't have a close relationship with anyone, we just keep in touch occasionally.
So what is the atmosphere like when you get together with your family?
Everyone is at peace except me.
I hate complicated things, so I stay alone.
I see. My younger sibling and I used to get along well, but after he got depressed, his personality changed and he became a bit of a social phobia.
It's a shame, I think the family must be having a hard time because they don't know what to do about mental illness.
Yes, that's why my younger brother is particularly having a hard time.
Are all your family members at your hometown now?
My father is in Busan, my mother is in Bucheon, my younger sister is in Gongju, and I am in Seoul.
They are all scattered all over the place.
It must be difficult to get everyone together.
Yes, so we rarely get together except for holidays.
Once your company contract is over, try having a family reunion.
Shouldn't we get together before Chuseok?
How long have you been seeing your girlfriend?
It's going to be our 2nd anniversary soon.
Even tomorrow is my girlfriend's birthday.
So what kind of gifts and surprises have you prepared?
Just eating a meal or something, you know.
As expected, you are sweet.
My girlfriend's birthday is in March so I still have some free time.
My girlfriend doesn't have much time, so I'd like to go out and hang out after the end of August, but I'm not sure about that because of the coronavirus.
Did you say your girlfriend was studying?
Yes, I hope everything goes well with your preparation for the police exam.
Are you preparing starting this year?
I hope everything goes well.
I took the test once, but the police test is given twice a year, so it's been almost a year.
Are you getting along well with your girlfriend?
Yes, I'm doing well, it's only been 80 days.
It's already been 100 days this month.
What would you like as a 100-day gift?
I wanted a Nintendo so I bought one, but it was a huge blow.
Should I just buy something else and sell it again?
Is there anything better than Nintendo?
How much does Nintendo cost?
The regular price is 340,000 won, the game title is 80,000 won, and there are many accessories such as other liquid crystal films.
But I think your girlfriend will really like it if you give it to her.
Is there anyone around you who raises an unusual animal?
It's not unusual, but I had a friend in elementary school who had a parrot.
I've never actually seen that parrot before, so I'd like to see it.
I didn't know, but I heard that parrots don't repeat everything you say.
Really? I guess only smart kids follow that.
Is the parrot big?
My friend had a small parrot, but the big ones were really big.
I have a friend who used to send me pictures of iguanas and lizards all the time because he said he wanted to raise reptiles, but I don't know if he's raising them now.
Reptiles need temperature control and seem like they would be very difficult to raise.
Yes, I think people who raise insects or reptiles are very careful. They are also expensive.
Yes, they are small in size, but even small insects like stag beetles are expensive.
Have you ever tried raising chicks sold at school?
I haven't raised one, but have you tried raising one?
I bought that when I was little and even raised chickens.
Really? If you raise them at home, they die after a while.
I was just playing around with it, but my father worked hard to raise me, and I eventually succeeded.
That's amazing. I heard that the chicks sold in front of schools aren't in good health to begin with. That's amazing.
Do you like traveling or camping?
Do you like traveling, even though you don't really like it?
I don't like it that much because it's a hassle, but it's actually fun when you go.
Do you like the sea or the mountains?
I like the ocean. I don't really like playing in the water, but just looking at the ocean makes me feel refreshed.
Doesn't it feel refreshing just to look at the mountain?
Green leaves and wide view
I don't like it because it's too hard to go up and down.
I guess you like mountains more?
No. I like the sea better than the mountains.
I went to play in the water last summer and it was definitely fun to play in the water.
I hate playing in the water, I can't swim and I'm a little scared.
I can't go in without a life jacket either.
I went to Caribbean Bay with my friends a while ago, and my friend almost died because he dropped it.
Then it would be really scary,
I never go where my feet can't reach.
When my friends all know how to swim and we go out to play, I find it hard.
I would like to try paragliding if I get the chance.
Paragliding looks fun too,
I want to learn fishing.
My father sometimes takes me fishing, so I've tried it a few times, but I don't know what's fun in it.
I also went there a lot with my father when I was young, and I think it's fun as long as you catch a lot of fish.
I tried going out to the middle of the ocean on a boat, but it was a bit scary and I don't like fish, so I didn't really want to touch them.
I can catch fish, but I can't catch things like earthworms.
What is the most fun or longest-played game you've ever played?
I've been playing LoL for the longest time, and it's fun to play with friends.
Weren't you a Roll Gold fan?
How long have you been doing this?
I think it started when I was in middle school, but if I've been gold for 10 years, then I guess I have no talent?
So what if you don't have talent? Just have fun.
Do you know the game called Monster Hunter?
My friend played it and said it was fun. Isn't it a really high-spec game?
There are many series, but the ones that came out for PC have higher specs. I've been playing that game for over 10 years.
You're such a die-hard fan, I guess that must be why you're so charming?
Honestly, I don't think I've ever seen a game quite like it.
The barrier to entry is a bit high, but if you get into it, you'll have to dedicate your life to it.
It's like a game of civilization where you have to change your life.
Have you tried a lot of civilization?
I played that game once
I haven't played a single round, but they say that when you play a game and come to your senses, years have passed.
I'm not sure because I only played one round, but once I finished one round, I felt refreshed.
I mostly play games where I play one round at a time, so my stamina goes down first.
As I get older, I need a lot of stamina to play games. I don't think I can do it like I used to.
That's right. When I was a student, I used to sit for 12 hours at a time and it was hard.
Have you ever traveled abroad?
I've never been abroad before. When will I be able to go?
When I saw it, I didn't think I could go. Have you been to many places in the country?
You haven't been around the country much, where have you been a lot?
I haven't really traveled much, but I've been to Gapyeong and Jeju Island several times, and only been to famous places like Busan and Sokcho.
When I went to Busan before, I went to the aquarium and it was really pretty.
I also want to go to the Busan Aquarium.
I've been to Seoul a few times, but I'm curious about other areas.
I heard that many people go to Gapyeong for travel or vacation. Is that okay?
It's just obvious. You go to places that everyone else goes to, like Namiseom or Ppaji.
Jeju Island was okay though.
When you go to Jeju Island, the only thing you hear is Chinese.
I think I'm more familiar with Chinese because I hear it more in Ansan. There's a Chinese person living downstairs from us.
There are a lot of restaurants near my house that have Chinese signs. I think there are a lot of Chinese people in Korea these days.
I remember going to North Korea on a school trip when I was a high school student.
That's amazing. Have you been to Geumgangsan?
Yes. We went to Mt. Geumgang and got skin disease from moths in a group and had to take a leave of absence. Even now, if you search it on Google, you can find articles about it.
What kind of moths live in Geumgangsan?
I wish fall would come quickly.
Yes, it's so hot these days.
The seasons are becoming more and more strange, so I feel like summer might end sooner.
I wish it were so. I hate summer because it rains a lot.
But I also catch cold easily and have a hard time in winter, so I hope my contract ends quickly.
I feel cold a lot too, but the weather has been really strange lately.
It was supposed to rain all week, but it hasn't rained again.
I'm worried that it'll snow a lot again in winter.
The snow used to be nice, but now there are traffic accidents and the ground is dirty. Fall is the best.
That's right. But it'll be over in a week or three weeks.
I feel like it's ending without me even getting to try on all the fall clothes.
That's right, it seems like the weather is gradually becoming more like summer and winter.
I really hope we don't have to wear masks next summer.
It's so annoying to wear a mask in the summer.
I think the season will be nice around the time we take our exams.
So maybe you took the test at that time on purpose?
You're smart. Are you currently attending Seoul National University?
I always pass by on the subway.
** The controversy over the athletes returning their medals turned out to be a lie.
Yes, I've seen it too. I don't understand why groups that promote social conflict do that.
People who instigate on Twitter are a problem, but the reporters who simply write articles and report on them are also problematic.
Yes, I thought I could trust Twitter and filter it out, but if not, they spread it around like crazy.
I think it's similar to when ** wrote a diss song and got criticized a lot. There's a tendency to fabricate false instigation.
There are too many people who just rush in and yell without even checking the basic facts.
**This time, I wrote an article defending ** and then changed it to a private account.
That guy just wrote after hearing that there were people who attacked ** players, and that's how it turned out.
Rather, older people are more susceptible to fake news than younger people.
That's right. But since the impact is so big and it's such a sensitive time, you can't just say you didn't know, so I hope you do some research yourself and write about it.
They said that foreign correspondents also wrote articles about the related content, but it turned out that they had also reported it themselves.
Strangely enough, it seems like everyone is on your side when it comes to that topic.
**I haven't been able to return to broadcasting yet
But in reality, I haven't seen many people like that.
Right now, my girlfriend and sister have nothing to do with it and actually hate it, but it seems like there's a lot of talk about it on the internet.
I've never seen it around me, but my friend's younger sister had it.
Thought is free, but there is no logic to it at all, so I don't know how people come to have such thoughts.
I just wanted to live comfortably and not think much, so I think that's how it turned out.
I've never seen anyone argue logically, so now I feel tired just thinking about the topic.
Recently, people all over the world are in chaos because of the abnormal weather phenomenon.
In Canada and the US, even slippers melt?
Yes, that's right. In the US, it recently got over 50 degrees and all the clams on the beach were cooked and opened up.
The tires are melting and now it's not Arctic tears, it's Arctic sobs.
It seems like the North Pole that we have to cry over will no longer exist.
They say that hundreds of people died in floods in China.
Every year we break records, and I don't know how much hotter it will get in the future.
Yeah, I think the Earth doesn't have much time left.
Would you like to go with Elon Musk to Mars?
I'd like to have a seat for us, but would you mind giving us a seat?
If I invest steadily in Tesla from now on, won't they recognize me and take me there someday?
I wish it were so,
How much longer can the Earth survive?
I think we might be the last.
They say that if the spread of coronavirus continues until this winter, new mutations may appear.
How much longer will they torment us when we can't even solve the mutation now?
They say a typhoon is coming right now.
I want to live a little more peacefully, but it's not easy.
I wish you would avoid our country.
Fortunately, the heat wave is expected to end this week and gradually subside.
That's really great news.
I wish fall would come soon.
A friend of mine recently had full body liposuction. Do you think it was effective?
It's amazing. I spent hundreds of dollars and had a lot of fat removed, but it was amazing. I became slim in just one day.
A friend of mine recently had full body liposuction. Do you think it was effective?
It's a wonderful world where you can lose weight without exercising.
Yes. There was a bruise on the area where it was sucked and it was wrapped with a pressure bandage until it recovered.
I think it would be very painful,
When the coronavirus is over, I want to erase some of the scars on my skin.
Where on your skin are you scarred? Have you been in a sword fight?
Many of my friends had acne because of the mask, and it was so bad that it turned into freckles.
I've been taking medication for almost six months now and I'm feeling better.
These days, it must be difficult to go to the dermatologist because of the coronavirus.
Are there any medications you can take for acne?
Yes, I already had a scar, but I had to keep taking it to prevent any more, and now even when I wear a mask, no new ones appear.
Oh, that's amazing. My sister also has acne problems, so I'll have to recommend it.
Are you going to a dermatologist and getting it made?
Yes, at first, they told me to take one pill a day, then one pill every two days, and then two pills a week.
I don't get acne, but I'm taking hair loss medication.
Are you here for a visit or for preventive measures?
As a preventive measure. It hasn't fallen out yet, but my father said that if you lose hair, there's a high chance of it falling out, so it's better to take it in advance, so I'm taking it.
I guess I should eat it too. They say that prevention is the best way to treat hair loss.
Now that I'm in my thirties, I'm starting to feel anxious because my friends around me keep getting belly fat.
Still, you don't look like you're in your thirties. Is it because you take good care of yourself?
I've been exercising regularly, but I like to drink, so I think I need to manage it more strictly.
That's right, I don't drink much so I just need to exercise, but the only sport I really like is futsal.
These days, because of the coronavirus, I can't even go to the gym, so I think it's best to just do home workouts. You have a lot of time.
Yeah, I think I should do more because my back is not good, but when it comes to actually doing it, I feel lazy.
Have you ever had any kind of surgery in your life?
I've never had surgery, but have you ever had surgery?
Aside from circumcision, I've only had one surgery when I was young due to a head injury.
Do you have insurance now?
Yeah, I have a few, but I just want them to be healthy.
I have two friends who recovered from COVID-19, and they both have aftereffects.
I saw on the internet that it also makes it hard to smell.
Yes. One person was cured in May, but he said that he actually couldn't smell well and that he couldn't taste food like he used to.
It's scary. I have to wear a mask and wash my hands well.
Yes. The scariest thing is that the other one is losing his hair.
It's really scary. Even if I took hair loss prevention medication, would I still have hair loss?
I bought some pants from an online shopping mall this week, but domestic brands are so expensive these days.
Men's clothing in particular tends to be more expensive than women's clothing.
Yes, that's right. Women's clothes are mostly duty-free, so they're not that expensive, but men's clothes, even if they're not famous brands, cost 30,000 to 40,000 won these days for just a short-sleeved T-shirt.
Yeah, I don't know how much more fabric would make that much of a difference.
I recently went grocery shopping at Baedal Minjok B Mart and it was really good.
My friend worked there and there were more people there than I thought.
Is that place just like any other big box store?
That's what they say, but they say that now they're like a delivery restaurant, they pack the food as orders come in.
Yes. I used to buy it from places like Lotte Mart, but this time I bought it from Baemin for the first time and it was shipped right away, just like food delivery.
There was a similar service when I worked at a convenience store, but I think it would be more efficient if we specialized in that.
Convenience stores have also improved a lot.
When I worked at a convenience store, there was no such thing. I just sold steamed buns and stuff.
There are people who order food from convenience stores at night as a late-night snack.
Do you send that by calling a delivery service?
Yes, if you put everything in the cart and call, a delivery person will come just like at a restaurant, but I don't know about Baemin Mart.
It's amazing. Anyway, it seems like e-commerce is the main thing these days.
Yes, that's right. I think the trading volume will increase even more in the future.
Do you have a favorite idol or singer these days?
I don't know because I'm not interested in idols or singers, but do you have a favorite singer?
Actually, I don't watch TV much these days and I don't really watch idols, but Karina is pretty.
Which girl group is Karina a member of?
Yes. It's a girl group called Espa. I hope you check them out.
My favorite celebrity is Lee Som.
Who is Lee Som? Is she an actress?
She is a model-turned-actress who occasionally appears in movies and dramas.
I guess I'll have to look it up sometime when I'm bored.
Do you have a favorite comedian?
I find Kim Yong-myeong so funny.
I don't really watch gag shows, but do you know about the gorilla date that Lee Yong-jin does? That was funny.
Isn't that finished?
It was one of my favorite shows.
I don't know. I didn't watch it, I just watched a few when my favorite rappers came out and they were really funny.
I've tried almost all of them, but I don't think I'll do them anymore.
That's too bad. There's a web drama called &quot;Jojoso&quot; on YouTube. I recommend it. It's guaranteed to be a hit.
Oh, I was going to watch it because it's famous, but I heard it's really good at capturing small and medium-sized businesses.
What is the last movie you saw?
It's been so long since I've seen it that I don't remember it well, but it's like Deliver Us from Evil.
It's really been a long time.
I recently saw Cruella and Black Widow, you know?
All I know is that Cruella is a character with half-and-half hair color.
I didn't even know Black Widow was released.
Cruella is a remake of the villain character from 101 Dalmatians, but it seems like a spin-off like Joker.
The character seems very unique. I also want to try dyeing my hair half and half.
What color do you want to dye your hair?
I really hope to see you at work sometime
I've only tried brown tones, but I'd like to bleach my hair and try gray.
Ah, I also wanted to bleach my hair and try a color like Kotori Beige, but bleaching is scary.
I was going to do it too, but my skin wasn't good at the time, so the director was strongly against it.
By the way, Black Widow has a lot of content that connects to the Avengers, so it feels like it was made a bit for the fans.
Since the genre is what it is, it has a large fan base, so wouldn't it be good to make it like that?
Since fans will watch it anyway, I think it's better to make it so that non-fans can watch it easily too.
My girlfriend didn't seem to find it very amusing.
People like me who don't know much about it probably won't watch it if you tell them to do so.
But Marvel is Marvel, so they did a good job. It was pretty.
Marvel definitely seems to have a large fan base.
What did you eat last night?
I ate noodles last night. What about **?
I ate grilled meat that I had at home yesterday.
Wow, really? Pork belly? Or did you eat another part? Haha
I had some beef in the freezer for a long time, so I ate it because I felt like I had to eat it! It didn't taste that good because it was kept for a long time.
Wow, but still beef! I'm jealous! Haha
Speaking of beef, I suddenly thought of raw beef. **, do you like raw beef by any chance? I really like raw beef.
I like raw meat too, but I don't really like raw meat with red seasoning.
The style varies from region to region, but the most common one is the gochujang seasoning.
Oh! That's exactly the same. I don't like seasoned raw meat either.
So when I go to a buffet, I first check if it's seasoned raw beef or not. Haha
** When you go to a buffet, what food do you eat first?
These days, I just eat things like salmon sashimi and salad?
I also eat raw fish often after eating raw fish first as an exception. My digestive function deteriorates as I eat raw fish. Haha
** Do you have anything like this?
I have to eat what I want even though my digestive function is poor, so I just eat and choose to be sick...
I don't know if it's just me, but when I have indigestion, plum extract works better than medicine. Haha
I tend to skip over indigestion and just vomit, so plums didn't solve the problem?
Oh really? Even when I have severe diarrhea, I can solve it with plums. I guess it's different for everyone!
I like plum extract, so I eat it often! But I suddenly want to eat it.
What did you eat last night?
Plum extract is good! If you drink it instead of coffee or other drinks in the summer, it's good for your health and beauty.
I suddenly want to drink it too. Refreshing!
You've moved in and finished tidying up the house, right?
Yes, I'm finally done with organizing. But I still have a lot to fill in. I haven't even bought a proper set of dishes yet.
** Did you get the water purifier by any chance? Haha
No, my logic was weak, Kiki
I just wanted an ice water purifier, and BTS happened to be on CF, so I was tempted by that, but I guess there's a limit to how much fandom can lead to consumption.
After all, water purifiers are not cheap... haha
And then I bought a cell phone.
** Are there any other furniture or interior items you would like to buy?
I haven't been able to buy a bedside table for two years.
I want to go and buy it myself but they don't go out haha
Oh, I was thinking that it would be convenient to have a nightstand to put by the bedside.
I need to buy a laundry basket, but I can't find anything suitable.
I need to buy it quickly, but ** lives in an apartment, so there's a veranda, right?
Yes, I have a balcony because my apartment is not an extension.
I chose that place because of the veranda...
That would be nice. If I had a veranda, I wouldn't have to worry about laundry, but since it's a studio apartment, I'm worried about drying the laundry.
I'm seriously considering buying a mini dryer.
Some people even run a dehumidifier while hanging their laundry.
Yes, I'm trying to do that, but it still smells, so I'm not sure what to do.
Do you know of any way to do this?
I think it's a little better to use an indoor drying detergent!
Oh, Downey has a detergent like that.
Have you ever tried it?
I've been using it consistently since it came out, and at first I couldn't tell the difference, but when I stopped using it, it became noticeable...
But there's nothing you can do if you dry it indoors.
Oh, then I definitely have to try it too.
If it really works, there's no reason not to use it.
I was really stressed out because of the smell of laundry.
Or, if you're in a hurry, wouldn't it be a good idea to go to a coin wash and have it dried?
I thought about that method too. Haha
It would be convenient if there was a coin laundry shop.
When drying laundry on the veranda, do you use a ceiling-mounted drying rack or just a regular drying rack?
These days, when I take the subway at 7:16, I run into someone who is so annoying and shameless that it stresses me out.
So I set my alarm back 5 minutes to catch the 13-minute train.
What kind of person is he? I suddenly became curious. Haha.
There are no seats on the subway, so people usually stand, but that person gets on a little after me.
But he insists on the specific spot I'm standing in and he comes in there and makes fun of me.
And when I look at her, she tries to ignore my gaze and firmly holds her place every time the subway shakes.
Well... everyone has a spot they want to stand, but if there's someone there, they go somewhere else. That person is really shameless.
When I ride the subway, I always think, I wish people would go inside instead of at the entrance...
Oh, that's right! Or, if you're standing, step aside when the door opens...
When there are a lot of people, you can get off and get back on, but there's always someone standing in front of the door looking at their phone all the time. It's not like they're addicted to their phone or anything...
And rather, the people who get off have no choice but to touch it and get angry
Well, it can't be helped on crowded subways, so why are you being so sensitive about that...
If you don't like that, I'd like to tell you to use your own car.
By car... Ah... Also, the traffic in Seoul is no joke...
I'm riding in the car with a friend on my way home from work, and we get off at exactly 6 o'clock, right?
When I get home, it's 7:30 at the earliest? Usually 40 minutes.
Oh my... If you do it like that, the subway might be better.
If I leave quickly, I think I'll arrive a little after 7!
Oh, but I still don't have time. The subway ride home is so crowded that I get really tired when I ride it.
Really terrible Kiki
That's right... I've never actually been in a room in Yeoksam before Kiki
I ride in the opposite direction and it's pretty good at Yeoksam Station.
But if you transfer to Line 7 at Konkuk University Station, then that's when it really starts...
I heard that Line 7 is really crowded.
Is there more than line 2?
I don't think I've ever felt crowded on Line 2 except when I was going from Wangsimni to Gangnam on Line 2, and I don't think it's ever crowded on the way to or from work.
Really? I always thought there were a lot of people from Sadang to Yeoksam.
But even so, it's not as good as the Line 9 express train...
Teacher, did the hospital you went to before have a lot of employees?
The hospital I used to go to in Busan was a very crowded hospital. It was a two-story hospital.
I think it's hard to become close with a lot of employees.
I guess so.
Still, since I had some level of rank, I should have tried to become friendly with everyone.
For office workers, we spend more time at work than at home each day, so it would be difficult if we didn't get along with our coworkers.
Yes, that's right. And the higher the position, the more you have to manage, so a certain level of friendship is essential.
Because it makes it easier for me to handle the work.
Teacher, you changed fields.
What did people around you say?
Since it was my future anyway, no one really said anything. Haha
Teacher, is being a stenographer your first job?
Yes, some time passed while I was preparing something else before that.
I sometimes wonder what it would have been like if I had decided to become a stenographer from the beginning haha
** How are you?
I'm satisfied now too.
I always thought that I had chosen the wrong major, but my thirst for that has been somewhat quenched.
I always worried that I chose the wrong career even though my major was okay, but it seems like being a stenographer isn't a bad job for a woman!
Last year, I worked briefly as a freelance stenographer, commuting to and from work.
Human psychology is funny. It was a system where you get paid according to the amount of work you do, but I was so blinded by money that I started working without any breaks.
I'm used to the workload now, so it's actually more, but I'm still psychologically stable, so that's good.
Yes, I think psychological stability is important.
If you're impatient, you'll end up making mistakes. Haha. I think being relaxed is also important!
I will continue to work as a stenographer in the future, but this company is my first place to work, so I feel a bit like a mother bird.
Even though it's unrequited love... I hope I can keep working.
** I wish the teacher was here too haha
Yeah, I think it's okay here too.
In a way, this is where I first started working in earnest! I wish we could work together! Haha
I saw Steel Troops briefly on TV before, and the cast members were really popular back then, right?
Oh really? Actually, I don't really know because I don't watch TV much, but what is it roughly about?
I don't know much about the military system, but it seemed like special forces or UDITs? or whatever, came out and played a game where they used their units' names to show off their skills.
I don't know much because I only watched it briefly, but there were a lot of articles about how popular the cast members were.
Is that Mr. Park...? He's really famous. Did he appear in Steel Troops?
Oh right, that guy was there too.
But I think he's famous for singing trot.
He only heard a little bit about the content while working on Miusae...
I was so curious about Park Gun and Park Gun that I even looked up who he was.
Kiki, I think you lived near Ulsan
When I think of UDT, I think of the Navy.
Was Judith a naval special agent?
I don't know, was it the Navy or the Marines...?
Oh, my dad was a Marine, but he doesn't really show it.
Marines are so bad at that, but my dad hates talking about Marines...
Hmm... I don't think my dad likes that kind of stuff. Haha.
Marine Corps pride is awesome haha
Since you never brought up the subject, I once asked you what on earth happened. Kiki
Kiki often talks about how he went to Jinhae to play and got into a fight with some drunken sailors and got into a herniated disc.
Oh really? Kiki
Why do people get into fights and cause accidents whenever they drink alcohol?
Military drunk driving incidents occur more often than you might think.
My father's generation lived longer, so there must have been a lot of such things, right?
I heard that the Navy and Marines didn't get along well. I don't know what it's like now.
We're both protecting the sea, so we'll protect each other in a friendly way... Kiki
Oh really? I didn't know we were on bad terms.
Yeah... It's hard, but it would be better if we kept in touch haha
Since I don't have any military experience, the more I talk, the more curious I become...
I don't really have anything to say because I've only talked to my boyfriends. Haha
I don't think there's just one person, but did you wait for the entire military?
Wow... She's a girlfriend of will...
No, Kiki.
I waited for just one person. I've been dating one person for quite some time, so Kiki
The rest of us met after we had all been there.
I don't have a license yet, but I really want to get it this time, but I've let down my greed a little.
I wish I could get at least a 3rd grade license.
I'm really greedy this time. I really have to get Kiki...
**Why are you so greedy, sir?
Even if you try to be greedy, you'll get nervous and stop, so anyway...
I decided not to think about it like I did when I just went there for practice.
I shouldn't be nervous either, but I think it might be because of the pressure of wanting to win.
This time, I'm going to take a tranquilizer and go.
I bought 5 bottles of the tranquilizer from the pharmacy last time and took them at the same time every day for 5 days before the test, but it didn't really work...
I also didn't see much effect from the ones I bought at the pharmacy.
This time, I'm going to try taking the medicine prescribed by the hospital. I'll have to get it tested, though...
It's been exactly a year since I started earning money through stenography, but I was an unqualified stenographer during that time, so I'm kind of looking to get away from it this time...
I don't even have a driver's license, so I don't have any qualifications at all.
Oh really? I have a certificate, but it's not very useful on the stenographer haha
Are there any other certifications you would like to obtain other than the shorthand certification?
First of all, I need to drive urgently... and also...
Oh, it's not a certificate, but someday I'll get a perfect score on the TOEIC test...
Ah TOEIC... When I was in school, I also took TOEIC...
The best thing is that I'm free from the stress of TOEIC. Haha
I want to get a computer qualification. Computer skills
I think I'll get a computer eventually and it would be nice to have a barista too Kiki
I'm a computer... ha...
I'm so computer illiterate that I cried while taking the written test... Why on earth do I have to memorize this stuff?
I don't think I'll be able to get it yet because it's hard to use a regular 2-set keyboard these days...
I also forgot the 2-set keyboard, so I don't know how to do on the Word exam.
Teacher, don't you want to have brothers and sisters?
I never really thought about my brothers and sisters.
I like only children better haha what about you teacher?
Have you ever thought about being an only child?
I never thought about it because I love having a younger sibling so much haha
I also like being alone, so I've never really thought about it.
Have you ever thought about how many children you would like to have if you get married?
I think I'd be overwhelmed with just one. Actually, I don't even think about having children...
What about the teacher?
I want to have two children if circumstances allow haha
But I have a feeling that the conditions won't allow it... and I'm old too...
Ah... that's right...
If we're going to have children, don't we have to do it quickly now?
These days, people are giving birth even in their 40s...
I could have a baby in my 40s, but it would be hard on my body. Haha.
It's good to have children when you're young, but marriage tends to be quite late.
But there is a period of dating before marriage...
Teacher, how long have you been dating before you want to get married?
I think it should take at least a year.
Even if we started dating after getting to know each other, it's very different when he's my boyfriend and when he's my friend.
What about you, teacher? If you are dating
I joke that I only had a year to make a formal statement... I've been dating for about 17 years...
If it's someone else's business, I'd say live together in a relationship for about 3 years before getting married.
3 years... um... actually that would be the best, but since time is running out, I guess I'll have to shorten it to 1 year...? haha
Right~ Dating is a completely private area and it's different for everyone and every situation is different.
The person I've seen get married the fastest around me is my maternal uncle who had a baby right after meeting her and got married before she was full.
Wow... You really did it with short-term properties.
My close friend also got married after meeting the parents within 6 months.
It was a blind date, but it's not easy to do that on the day of a blind date, right?
I thought I would die laughing when I calculated the date when my aunt gave birth later. Kiki
I guess my uncle really loved and liked my aunt a lot. Haha
How nice it would be if you could recognize it like that at first sight haha
Haha, what do you think about love at first sight?
Hmm... I don't know what it feels like to fall in love at first sight, but I think I've experienced someone who you just get a feeling for when you see them!
I've never fallen in love at first sight before so I don't know what it feels like haha
I guess the appearance aspect can't be left out, right? I guess?
As for the external part, I think we'll find out other things right after the scan is finished, right? Haha
I think the first snow you're thinking of isn't the exact moment you physically see each other haha
Rather than feeling love at first sight... I can't explain the feeling... sparks flying? That person feels different? It was like that. Haha
I saw that person and there were moments when it seemed like it was in slow motion.
Didn't you really think that something was going to happen between you and that person the moment you first saw them?
I don't remember well because it's been over ten years since I started dating...
At first, there wasn't any, but as time went by, I thought, &quot;What is this? What is this person? What is this strange feeling?&quot; I did have those things. Haha.
It was the first time in my life that I felt that way. Even though I really liked someone and had had many experiences.
Nowadays, people say &quot;samgyunda&quot;, but in the past, there was also a word called &quot;somtanda&quot;.
Ambiguous state? What do you think about that?
I don't like ambiguity. I like certainty.
If you like someone, you should meet them first and think about it. Haha, how can you know someone without meeting them?
** What about you?
That's what they call a halfway meeting... a state where there are no obligations to each other?
But I think that's all a defense mechanism created out of fear of getting hurt. If the other person needs that kind of time, then you should do it.
Well... I think it's cowardly, but on the other hand, I wonder if it's because he was hurt in the past.
If you have confidence in the other person, but they need a period of freedom from obligations to you, your pride will be hurt.
I don't really understand people these days... I'm from that generation too, but I don't understand the MZ generation haha
Um... but is that really love...?
I think so.
Ultimately, I feel like I don't want to take responsibility for any part of it.
In the end, I'm going to try some pseudo-relationships and then decide whether to date for real or not...
I wouldn't even start with someone who doesn't fit in that area haha
Hmm... I don't want to tolerate anything that doesn't suit me. Haha
These days, things are definitely different. In the end, it's me first?
I have a betta, but I haven't had much time to take care of it lately, and then I noticed that the tip of its tail is split...
Really? They say it could be due to malnutrition. Are you giving it any nutritional supplements?
Of course~ I'll give you some nutritional supplements too...
But I changed the water a little bit every day and then changed it a lot once every few days, so I think the pet is stressed from changing the water.
Oh... right. I heard that fish get stressed when they are returned to the water.
How do you get a refund?
What tool do you use to do this?
I use a dropper to scoop up the excrement one by one.
It's a beta so the tank is small.
Aha, my fish tank is a bit big, so I tried buying and using water change products separately, but in the end, I just transferred the water to the container and changed it.
I really thought I was going to die...
In the past, we had separate large fish tanks and shrimp tanks, and we couldn't even think of recovering them.
So, I try to run the pump as much as possible to avoid having to refill, and whenever I have time, I use a dropper and add a lot of oxygen...
I see that they suck up the microbial waste in the tank with their suction cups? Cleaning fish! Yes, they say there are cleaning fish, have you ever thought about them? Haha
There was that too Kiki
But I couldn't handle it... I just raised it for appreciation. Bipa...
I see. I thought about raising them because they were too hard to manage, but I gave up because I thought they would create something new. Haha
What is Beta's personality like? I heard it's a bit different from Guppy's.
Beta is so pretty
But they are so ferocious that you can only raise one. If you keep two males, they will fight to the death...
Wow... Really?
Oh, now that I think about it, I think it's because I thought Betas couldn't be raised with other species.
Goofy... um... has too many babies... Kiki
That's right, it's hard for other kids to merge too.
When raising guppies, at first I separated the females that were about to give birth into hatching tanks one by one, but later I just left them, saying that I would leave only the ones that would survive. They gave birth to so many haha
Yes, they really do give birth to too many. So they eat their own babies...
I saved your life because you caught and ate it, but I couldn't handle it, so Kiki
I'm looking for an opportunity to grow shrimp again, but I don't think I'll be able to do that for a while since I have a lot of time at home haha
They say that shrimp really require a lot of care.
The shrimp were pretty so I looked into it for a while, but then I just gave up... haha
I want to try salmon fishing. It's out of the blue, but I like eating salmon and I also want to try fishing, so Kiki
Why does Kiki's salmon fishing make me think of a brown bear...
I've been really into watching women's volleyball lately. It's so much fun now that they've made it to the Olympic semifinals.
Oh, I only watched the Korea-Japan match, but I only heard about the match against Türkiye!
I only know two players... Heejin and Yeonkyung unnie haha
Kiki God Yeon-kyung... She's a really cool person... Not only is she good at volleyball, she's also a great leader.
I think it's so cool that a male and female player is ranked number one in the world!
Actually, I don't know the rules very well, but do you know them, teacher?
I just roughly passed it over. No, I passed it over, but I only know that it is outside the line and inside the line. I am Kiki.
Actually, I was in a regular volleyball club for 4 years... and I even played in a Kiki match. So I like volleyball.
Volleyball is where I felt the fun of team play, haha
Oh right haha, teacher you said you played volleyball, how did you end up playing it?
I've seen people playing badminton, tennis, and table tennis, but this is my first time seeing someone playing volleyball.
I used to have a friend who was obsessed with volleyball... I was drawn to him...
I'm sure he'll be useful since he's tall... Kiki
Why aren't you doing a club now?
That club is in Ulsan... Volleyball is fun, but it's really tough... It's really bruising and chaos...
I used to practice with the ball that the guy hit, and seriously... when I think about it, I want to cry... Kiki
And you have to have guts to get the ball. Kiki
Is that different for men and women? That's interesting.
Is the ball a bit soft or hard?
It's a difference in power...
If you just watch the game, you wouldn't know that the ball is that fast, but if you receive it on the court... Kiki, some kind of missile flies... Seriously...
Ah~ It wasn't the ball material haha. I really suck at drawing...
But when I hear it, it seems like people wearing glasses might be dangerous?
Yeah... that's right. So you really have to avoid it Kiki
When receiving the ball, you have to lower your body as much as possible, but if it comes above your shoulder line, it is out so you have to avoid it, and conversely, if it comes below your shoulder line, it is in so you have to receive it.
You have to figure it out and either avoid it or accept it. Kiki
I really don't know what it means Kiki
In the past, I barely managed to get a performance evaluation, so I thought I wouldn't have to do this kind of thing when I went out into society, but here's someone who does it on their own... Kiki
The point is that it wasn't voluntary... I was dragged in... Kiki But it's fun if you do it.
But I had to go through a lot of trials and tribulations to get there. Kiki
Teacher, you don't play LoL?
Yes. I don't play LoL because I get cursed at a lot. Kiki
Teacher, do you play LoL?
No, I tried it, but I didn't really like it, so I just did the tutorial and turned it off. Kiki
At first I thought LoL was a game from Blizzard. Kiki
I went to arcades a lot when I was young. Did you go to arcades a lot, too?
In the arcade, there's Tetris and other things where you have to tap on things, right? I used to do that a lot...
What about the teacher?
I played a lot of airplane games like 1945 haha
And when I went to the arcade, there was a place where I could hit a baseball, and I think I did that without fail. Haha
Are you talking about the one where the ball actually pops out?
Yes. I didn't do it on purpose. I started doing it because of a friend who took me to play volleyball. When I'm stressed out, I go and play a few times and it relieves my stress. Kiki
Wow, teacher, you're really brave... I'm scared of it so I can't even look at it up close...
I think I got a lot of that kind of energy thanks to that guy... Kiki
At first, I was scared and just avoided it, but every time I did that, I said, &quot;Hey! Don't avoid it! It'll make you scarier from behind... Just look at Kiki's ball and Kiki will do it.&quot;
Teacher, then shooting? Do you do that too?
Yes, I do shooting and archery.
It seems like they shoot almost everything except for live ammunition...
What about the teacher?
I just play that shooting game... that's not really what you're doing Kiki
Oh but I don't like zombies either. I really hate zombies.
By any chance, House of the Dead? Kiki, I used to do that a lot...
This is a game that I really worked hard at, even though I was scared of zombies. Kiki
That sounds right! These days, there are things like riding on a vehicle and shooting guns, but I haven't tried that because I'm afraid of getting carsick.
Teacher, have you tried it? Kiki
No. I haven't tried that, but it reminds me of something that looks like something I'd ride. These days, racing games come out in that format. Kiki
I tried it once and ugh... I got muscle pain as a bonus. The game is tough.
Teacher, you don't play LoL?
I watched Bon Voyage yesterday too, and the salmon fishing in New Zealand looked so much fun.
Have you been to New Zealand?
No. I wanted to go to New Zealand, but I haven't been able to.
I always went to Japan or Europe.
Kiki the picky traveler
** So you want to go to New Zealand and go salmon fishing? Haha
Yes, but New Zealand is very nature-oriented...
I'm more of a city type, what about you, teacher?
Um... I think I'm the natural type...
Actually, I don't know because I haven't been to many places that are close to nature.
But I think it's definitely more of a small city type than a big city type!
I love the hustle and bustle of a big city!
Everyone is busy, but it's a secret pleasure to wander around like a traveler... Kiki
Oh really? But then doesn't that not fit with the vacation spot? Haha
Yes, that's why vacations are only available at large resorts... Kiki
I really like walking around, so I prefer small cities over big cities. Haha
I heard that the trip is so popular. Have you ever been there?
Yes, but I've only been to famous tourist destinations like Osaka, but I've been to small cities in Germany that are really nice to travel to.
At that time, I didn't plan the trip, but a friend who lived there made the plan and I went along with it. It was really a plan for me haha.
That's when I realized that it's the local people who need to make the plans!
I went to Osaka, Kobe, Kyoto, and Yo Line in Japan! 8 What is the hottest time to go to Kiki?
If you tell me to go back like that again, I can't go even if I get paid. My pores are really opening automatically...
But I'd like to try traveling somewhere with local acquaintances... I think it would be great.
I went that line too! Kiki
But that's a plan that everyone does, so it's a bit boring.
It's really convenient to travel with someone who is fluent in the local language. Kiki
And since you know it well, you can enjoy it even more. Haha
I was curious about the restaurants that locals usually go to, so I went to Kiki.
Ah! I went to a restaurant like that when I traveled to Germany. It's a popular restaurant for locals! It was really delicious.
It's definitely different from the restaurants in travel brochures. It was squid ink pasta, and I want to go back and eat it again... I remember the taste.
I also want to go to a local person's house and see how they live!
I have a friend in Japan, so I've been to his house before, and I would say his house is really full...?
What's really amazing is that they each have their own bathtub!
They say Japanese people really like taking baths.
Japan was so humid in the summer that it was hard, but now Korea feels almost the same...
That's right. When I went to Japan in the summer, I swore I would never go back in the summer again, but now the weather in our country is like that...
There aren't many mosquitoes these days. Maybe it's because the weather is so hot.
Cicadas only sing when it's cool in the morning and evening Kiki
They're hot too...
How hot must it be for even cicadas to give up singing?
Cicadas really start crying from early in the morning. Kiki
When I went to Gimhae and was taking a walk in broad daylight, I saw sparrows huddled together in the shade.
I thought you were going to pick up something to eat, but there was nothing Kiki
It was just hot
Ah... why is it so cute when I imagine it...? Kiki
But it's really hot these days, so I'm worried about the animals living on the streets.
There will be no water
That's right, the water at the neighborhood cat feeding station was dirty and dry!
And somehow, it feels like the water will boil during the day...
That's why... I think it's really hard for both animals and people because the weather is so hot.
I even thought that maybe winter was better... It's the first time in my life that I've thought like this. Kiki
But there was almost no rainy season this year, right? In Seoul...
It rained so long last year that I was exhausted haha
Yeah... It rained so much last year and it was really disgusting, but this year it's really disgustingly hot...
There is no middle ground Kiki
Last year, when it rained a lot, I thought it was not summer-like weather and wished it was a little sunny, but I was crazy. Kiki
That's right. Kiki, but if you think about it carefully, I really hate it when it rains that much...
Which of the two do you hate more? I like the rain, though.
I hate rain too! I wish it would come every morning from 1am to 5am Kiki
Me too. Kiki, I hate rain too, so I wish it would rain while I sleep.
Kiki, it can't be helped if it doesn't rain at all
Right, if it doesn't rain for a long time, the fruit won't taste good later on!
That's right. We need to get enough rain for the farmers.
But since there hasn't been much rain this year, will the crops turn out well?
Farmers are also taking a big hit because of the coronavirus.
Since they don't go to school, they can't supply food to the cafeteria.
Oh really? I didn't think about that part.
The social damage caused by Corona is considerably greater than expected.
It seems that more vegetables and fruits are included in school meals than you might think.
Before that, the crops in the field had already grown, so I saw them just plowing them over because the labor costs to harvest them and other things didn't make sense.
Oh, by the way, I heard that many bakery owners make a living by supplying to factories, and that they've been hit hard by the coronavirus.
They said that it was because they reduced the cost of snacks at the factory.
Since we are refraining from eating out, everything is going to be difficult, starting with the primary industry.
Well... but e-commerce is booming thanks to that, right?
Yeah, that's really ironic.
** Are you planning to get vaccinated?
I have to! I really want to do it, but I don't know if I'll be able to make a reservation for the 10th episode this time...
I'm still thinking about it.
They say that these days, getting a vaccine appointment is almost more difficult than getting tickets for popular idol singers.
It was like that last time I made a reservation for 50s, but this is my first time trying the 10-part system, so I don't know how it will be.
There are almost no remaining vaccine reservations in Seoul, so it's like collecting concert ticket cancellations.
The introduction of the 10-part system should proceed smoothly without confusion.
Following the Delta mutation, there is now a Delta Plus case. Will this really end? Kiki
There are even opinions that say that our country should change direction and continue to go together like a cold.
Yes. I thought it would be really difficult for self-employed people to survive because there were so many prohibitions.
There are limits to what you can do with delivery, and I don't know what will happen if we continue like this.
Looking at the fact that there are still serious patients coming out, I wonder if they are only thinking about the position of healthy people...
Well... I think this is a really difficult problem. It's one that can't be taken lightly by one side.
I thought that the people working on site must be having a really hard time.
This time, since the population is also large due to the age characteristics, I hope that the reservations are made and the vaccinations are administered without any problems!
So, this virus is definitely not a natural virus. Seeing how it mutates so quickly...
The origin of the coronavirus is China, so there are many suspicious aspects haha
Yes, there are various theories, but the one related to China also has Bill Gates involved, so it's said to be an issue in the US. Haha
The US-China conflict shows no signs of abating, so I hope we don't end up with a shrimp getting hurt in a fight between whales.
I think it's because our country is geographically an important region.
In a fight between hegemonic powers, you really have to think carefully, and I think that's not an easy task.
This isn't something that can be solved just by one leader behaving well. We need an absolute evil being, so right now in Korea, there's a partisan fight over whether it's China or Japan, and the people haven't come to their senses and are openly making too many hateful remarks about other countries.
Yes. But the bigger problem is that it's not just our country's problem.
Even within other countries, such as China and Japan, it seems like hatred and dislike for one's own country is a big issue.
Are there any countries that are geographically close and friendly? Haha
Um... no... Kiki absolutely does not.
In fact, if you look at the current relationships in Europe... they are truly miraculous relationships.
But looking at it now, it seems like it really isn't an easy problem, seeing as the relationship isn't all that good!
Still, in a global disaster like this, I hope we can help where we can.
Not only Corona, but there are many countries that are suffering from serious climate disasters, so I think they need some attention.
That's right. Everyone says they're going carbon neutral, but developing countries can't do that for their own development.
But I also honestly don't know if that's the right way to go for the climate and what's right.
I wish developed countries, which have already emitted a lot of carbon, would pay a lot of carbon taxes.
Including our country. Our country is also a climate villain country.
That's right. I think it's very selfish to say anything to developing countries now, when they've enjoyed everything they could and ruined it.
Our country has also contributed greatly to the climate crisis.
The country is underwater and has become a wasteland where crops cannot grow, so the poverty problem is serious. Ultimately, it is the underdeveloped countries that have developed to this extent, so I think they should take responsibility.
But the international organizations that are supposed to do such things are ultimately on the side of the advanced countries that pay a lot of money.
Kiki, I hope we all come to our senses before the Earth is destroyed.
But I think it's already going to fall apart... Kiki
It feels like I'm experiencing the climate change crisis with my whole body...
That's right, but I feel a bit unscrupulous saying this while feeling the cool air conditioning breeze haha
So... Kiki
It's funny how you say that you're experiencing a climate crisis because of the hot weather on your way to work. Kiki
It's hot these days so it's not easy to even apply anything, right haha
Yesterday, I was talking to my close friend about oily skin types and we also talked about cosmetics.
** What is your skin type?
I think it's that guy!
I originally thought he was completely intelligent, but maybe it's because he's getting older...
I'm a water buff too. Kiki
So when I told her it had been a few years since I last used makeup on my skin, she was surprised.
I just apply sunscreen and go out.
My skin is getting worse because I put on makeup
Strangely enough, I look better when I put on makeup.
But right now it looks like that, you know?
I feel like when I wash off my makeup, my whiteheads disappear with it?
When I wash my face, my skin gets more irritated and it gets even worse. Hehe
So I use cleansing water.
That's it, wake up in the morning and wash your face.
So my skin has really improved. I don't need to wear makeup.
Do you use cleansing water not only to remove makeup but also to simply wash your face?
That's it for the cleansing water.
I just use it twice with a cleansing water cotton pad and that's it.
I washed my face to remove my makeup, so my skin got even worse...
Uh... I also just do the first cleansing with cleansing water and then wash it off with water and that's it haha
Ah, the eye remover is separate...
I feel like my skin ages a little slower because I don't wear eye makeup. Kiki
I've had wrinkles around my eyes since I was little, and that's been a concern.
But since my mom has the same shape, I don't think it's wrinkles caused by aging, so it's not responding to care. Kiki
Ah, you can't ignore the influence of genetics on skin. Haha
My maternal side of the family has relatively elastic skin, so I wonder if that has an effect.
When I was young, I didn't wear sunscreen because I didn't like sticky things, and to be honest, I don't really apply sunscreen these days either.
That's why I don't like to apply sunscreen, so I don't go outside in the summer.
Teacher, don't you hate sticky things when you're smart?
Yeah, I really hate that sticky stuff...
I put on sunscreen with all my might. Kiki
It is true that ultraviolet rays are the main culprit of aging.
Since Ji-seong doesn't age well, I guess I'll just live like this and let things take their course... Hehe
Kiki: I'm just going to live the way I am now.
My skin is prone to keloids, so I can't even dream of getting something like botox. I'm trying to live my life thinking that I should be thankful for the fact that I have this much skin. Kiki
Do you have keloid scars?
Yes, I have something similar on the bottom of my neck.
So it's a little sad, but they say that this happens above the chest.
My friend has a keloid scar on his back, and when he went to the hospital, he was told that it wasn't easy to remove.
That's right. Keloid scars are not easy to remove, so you really have to be very, very careful.
That's why I don't often go to dermatologists and get treatments.
I think it would be really uncomfortable not being able to pierce your ears or get a tattoo...
Oh, I got my ears pierced. Kiki when I was in middle school.
But fortunately, that didn't happen.
I got caught for that and got really scolded by my mom.
Teacher, have you ever had major surgery?
No, I don't have any major surgery. I hope I don't have any major surgery in the future...
Is the teacher there by any chance?
No, I've never had surgery or been hospitalized.
haha just a few hours of ringer
Fortunately, I'm curious about hospital life again...
Oh, I actually had eye surgery and was hospitalized!
I was under general anesthesia at the time, and I think I know why people can't wake up after being under general anesthesia.
How many days were you hospitalized for?
If you're under general anesthesia, teacher... you're saying you've had major surgery Kiki
Oh really...? Kiki
Wow, general anesthesia is really scary.
I was hospitalized for one day the day before the surgery, had the surgery, and was hospitalized for another day.
It's usually considered a major surgery, except for local anesthesia or procedures that can be done in one day! Kiki
Oh really? Kiki
I just thought it was a surgery, so I didn't think it was a big deal.
Anyway, I hope you stay healthy and don't need any major surgery in the future!
Yes, we will take care of our health so that we don't have to have any major surgery in the future! Haha
Teacher, you said you don't buy clothes on the Internet, so where do you buy them?
I mostly buy outside. I've had so many instances where the size doesn't fit...
Especially in the case of skirts, I always try them on before buying them.
** Do you buy a lot on the Internet?
I used to buy clothes online a lot, but I was almost always half successful and half failed?
I always try things on offline before buying them because my failure rate is almost 90%.
Where do you usually buy groceries?
I think we had this conversation last time
I use Coupang Fresh. Or I use Ssuk Delivery.
I looked around my house and found a grocery store.
So I'm thinking about buying it there and eating it myself... Which place would be cheaper...? Kiki
If you live alone, it may be more expensive to buy the ingredients and cook it yourself.
Especially if you don't have anything like seasoning at home at first...
I guess so?
I was thinking that I might have to go all the way to save on groceries.
Starting with real sesame oil, there is no soybean paste, no kimchi, no nothing.
Those things are definitely cheaper if you buy them online.
And I like it because there are more types of products than offline!
There is a reason why so many people use it.
These days, there's a lot of talk about how when you order Coupang Fresh, they don't collect the containers that come with the delivery.
Oh, that box... that's right. That thing gets annoying when the timing isn't right.
But people who keep doing it don't have to worry about that Kiki
Oh really? Why?
If you keep doing it, won't it increase more?
You don't even collect it properly?
It's a system where if you leave it in front of the door, it will be retrieved the next time you bring something.
So, if it doesn't stop, there won't be any problems?
Ah, then I guess I'll have to keep doing it. Kiki
I need to order a lunch box, but I'm not doing it because I'm lazy.
There are so many different types of lunch boxes coming out these days!
There's even a site that only collects lunch boxes!
Oh really? Can I share the site with you later? Haha
Teacher, I bought those 2020 Memories yesterday!
Oh really? Kiki, I have to renew my membership this time.
By any chance... **Could you join the army...? Kiki
I won't do it! I'm not ARMY!
Kiki **, it seems like you're almost an ARMY already...
When I told my friend Deokmae about it, he said that since he knew everything about the earthquake, it must be over.
No, I just happened to find out about it. It's not like I just decided to become a fan, so I'm still on a different level from real ARMYs like **! Kiki
Kiki: But I was curious. Is there a special reason why you like Tony?
I've liked it since a long time ago, so I can't really remember why, but now...
Is it because I liked it since I was very young?
Tony just exists in my life like air...?
Wow... that's cool. Kiki
I think BTS is... my source of energy? Vitamins? Kiki
But people don't know that, but when Tony sings, his voice is different from when he speaks, and it's very attractive!
You don't need to know, but Kiki
In Reply 1997, the female protagonist is a Tony An fanboy.
But when I look at her old appearance, I think I know why she was so popular! Kiki
It was popular...
The original Kiki's birthday party, Tony's birthday party, which is held all over the country without Tony
Kiki, do you remember that?
If you look at the response, Pocari appeared! and they were like that. The sasaengs at that time...
Pocari!
That car with the blue Tony decal on it is called Kiki
Oh but I wasn't that extreme back in the old days!
Kiki So, is ** closer to a light fan or is he closer to the opposite?
Teacher, what movie genre do you like?
I love romantic comedy!
Teacher, what genre do you like?
Oh me too, Loco! And SF!
But I watch pretty much everything except for the ones with zombies and chases.
I find it hard to watch horror movies. But I do want to watch Jang-hwa-hong-ryeon.
Have you seen it?
Oh, I saw that at the cinema and it was horrible!
Oh really? Why?
Is the content very violent?
No, I'm scared of the sound
Haven't you seen that at all?
No, I didn't see it at all.
If the sound is scary, ah... covering your eyes won't help, then... Kiki
I was thinking of going to see it
It's not the type of horror that makes you jump in surprise, it's the music and background that's scary.
You may have heard it used as background music on a broadcast, probably Kiki
But I've seen that one, but I've hardly seen any other horror movies.
Oh, I see. I have a friend who is a horror movie fanatic and he recommended it to me because it's scary... But I can't watch it...
** Do you like romantic comedies?
Yeah, but I don't remember the movie title very well...
I've been watching a lot of romantic comedies on Netflix lately.
Oh, there are a lot of interesting movies on Netflix these days. Have you seen Kingdom?
Teacher... There are zombies in Kingdom... I can't see it... Haha
Ah... Kiki
I can't see that horror, to be exact, I can't see western zombies, but strangely I can see this. Kiki
Just in case, check it out. It's fun. Kiki
Ah... but zombies are a bit...
But since I can watch Netflix at home and turn it off if I don't like it, I'll give it a try!
Yes, yes! Give it a try. The story is solid and fun. I highly recommend it! Kiki
Sister, do you like cake among desserts?
Yeah I like cake!
Then what kind of cake do you like?
I like cheesecake
Do you like cake?
I like yogurt cake and sweet potato cake~
So do you like macarons?
Do you have yogurt cake?
Hear it for the first time.
I like macarons
But it's too sweet so I can't eat much
Yeah, I like yogurt ice cream too, it was delicious.
I like it because it's not too sweet
My friend recommended it to me and said it was delicious!
Yes, the macarons are so sweet that 2 is enough.
Oh, I like yogurt too, but I can't imagine how it would taste in cake.
I'm curious~
It's really delicious
Sell it to Tous Les Jours
Be sure to try it next time
Oh okay!
I'll try it
You really like yogurt!
I like it too, so I have a yogurt maker at home.
We had one at home too, but it broke a while ago.
But I like sweet yogurt Kiki
My mom only buys and eats plain yogurt, so I don't eat it much at home.
Oh really?
I really like Greek yogurt more than sweet.
Really? I don't think my sister likes sweets that much!
There are different types of sweets
I don't think I like anything that's too sugary!
I see
I just like whatever sweet I like
I don't like bitter sweetness.
I see!
Let's go eat together next time~
What floor do you think would be appropriate for an apartment?
The apartments on the higher floors have a good view, but the elevators are a bit scary, so I think a middle floor would be better.
About 5-6 floors?
Really? I'm on the 15th floor right now and it seems perfect.
But if there's only one elevator, it might be hard to get out quickly, so I think a lower floor would be better!
Are there multiple elevators in the house you live in now?
There are two now
It's still frustrating, but I think it'd be incredibly frustrating if I lived in a place with only one unit again ㅜㅜ
Yes, I don't live in a large building, but there's only one elevator, so it can sometimes be a bit stuffy during rush hour.
Right, I'm on the third floor, and the system is such that when one elevator is coming to me, the other one doesn't move, so if someone holds it for too long, I have to wait a long time.
Oh, I know what that is
I was upset last time when I was commuting to work because the elevator upstairs kept getting held up.
That's why I'm really mad and it keeps stopping because there are a lot of people who always get on when they're busy ㅜㅜ
Yeah, I really don't know what you're doing.
I don't do it often because I just live in an officetel, but you must be really frustrated.
Yeah ㅜㅜ I used to have a lot of those when I was in school, but these days I avoid going to work and go to work early, so I'm almost always the only one riding the elevator and it comes quickly, so I like it haha
That's lucky~
But don't you have any stress from noise between floors in your house?
You were noisy once in a while, but it wasn't that bad, was it?
When I first moved in, I went to visit them once because they kept dragging furniture and making noise in the early morning, but now it's a little better ㅜㅜ
Was it noisy because you moved from the floor above?
Yeah, I guess so
I'm glad you're okay now!
Sister, do you have a driver's license now?
Yeah, I have a license!
When did you get your driver's license?
I'm 16 years old?
I got it when I was on leave
Do you have a license?
No I don't have a license
When do you plan on having a daughter?
I want to get it too, but I don't have time and I don't have a car anyway, so I'm not in a hurry, so I don't get it ㅜㅜ
Yeah, yeah, I'm almost a closet license holder now.
I got a type 1 but I forgot to put it in gear Kiki
Kiki, are you going to buy a car later?
Sometimes I want to buy a car, but I don't think I'll need it if I stay in Seoul.
Yeah, Seoul has so many cars and the traffic is so congested that it would be difficult to get around.
Yeah and the road is complicated so I'm not confident haha
As a beginner driver, I just want to drive on country roads.
Kiki But where I live now, it's a convenient neighborhood if you have a car.
Really? But you don't think driving is scary?
I think it's scary
And drivers tend to criticize women more if they see them, so I think they drive around trying not to be seen.
Yeah, be careful when you do it later!
What do you think about working standing up?
I can't do it standing up anymore because of my varicose veins. It's too hard for me. ㅠㅠ
Yeah, I hate doing it standing up too. It's too hard.
But until now, I think I've been working mostly standing up, Kiki
Part-time jobs usually involve standing up ㅜㅜ
I've never done it while sitting down either.
Yeah, I just sat down and worked once when I was working at the academy!
What kind of part-time job have you done?
I've mainly focused on restaurants
So I love sitting down and working now!
That's fortunate
Are you satisfied with your work? Isn't it difficult?
I don't think it's difficult yet
What about your sister?
I don't think I've had any major difficulties yet.
It's fun because I get to do a lot of different things in a short period of time.
Yeah, but I find it a little hard to adjust when I first start working, but once I get used to it, it's fun.
Yeah, everyone is like that haha
But don't you think it would be good to be able to learn a lot of things during the contract?
Yes, I like it because I'm building my career and learning a lot of different things!
Let's work hard and learn a lot while we're here!
Okay, let's study hard!
Yeah, let's continue to work hard in the future!
Have you seen the Real Man TV show that was on before?
Yeah, have you ever seen Real Man?
Looking at that, it must have been really hard ㅜㅜ
Yeah, that's true, but there were a lot of really funny things there, Kiki
Did you see the episode with Henry and Sam Hammington?
I think I've seen it before, Kiki
I think it was funnier because I was a foreigner
Right, is that Taekwondo?
It was a scene where they did something like that, and it was really funny
Even now, if you look at YouTube, it comes up every now and then
Kiki Really? It's been so long that I forgot everything, but I should watch the one that's on YouTube.
Yeah! And the Real Man episode on Infinite Challenge was really funny, but there were a lot of military experience programs like that. Now that I think about it, Kiki
I didn't see what happened on Infinite Challenge ㅜㅜ
I'll show you later
If you still want to see something funny, look it up sometimes. Haha
Kiki, I like you. Recently, after Fake Man became popular on YouTube, there were a lot of military-related programs.
Oh right, but have you never seen a fake man?
Yeah, I don't like feeling frustrated and angry, so I didn't watch it on purpose. What about you, Unnie?
Is that frustrating and upsetting?
I don't like that kind of thing either, Kiki.
I don't know the details, but I think so ㅜㅜ
Yeah, that's what it says!
Do you tend to get nervous when taking tests?
Oh, I get really nervous ㅠㅠ
Me too ㅜㅜ
Even if you usually do well, when it comes to tests, your performance doesn't match your abilities.
That's right, that's why I think you have to practice at least 120% to get a little bit out of it.
That's right, I have to think about making mistakes because I'm nervous ㅜㅜ
Yeah yeah
I even took medicine during the last exam Kiki
But my hands were shaking so much
Kiki, even if I take medicine, it doesn't work?
It's a medicine that reduces heart rate, so it doesn't really help with hand tremors.
Are your hands shaking too?
So you're not going to eat it for this test?
Yeah my hands are shaking too ㅜㅜ
This time I'm going to eat it too!
I have to go get a prescription so
Oh, are you taking your prescribed medication?
Yeah! I hope this is the last exam... haha
I wish I could do that too, but I think I'll get other qualifications later, so I don't think it'll be the last time Kiki
Ah, me too... Let's work hard!
This shorthand test is almost here.
Okay, let's work hard for the remaining period!
Yeah, let's all do our best together!
Are you close with your brothers, sister?
I live with my sister and we're pretty close, but with my brother... I just...
Just like that Kiki
Don't you usually keep in touch with your brother?
Only when you really need to contact me?
But that doesn't happen very often haha
What about you?
I also live with my older sister, so we're close~
I think that if you are the same gender, you tend to rely on each other more.
right?
Yeah, I think it's because it makes more sense
There's not much of an age difference between you and your sister, right?
Did you go to school together?
Two years difference
But I don't really remember going to school together.
Did your sister go with you?
When I was in first grade, my sister was in sixth grade.
So I remember when there were kids who were bullying me, I would go and tell them as a joke.
It was sturdy
i envy you
Sister, there's a huge age gap between us Kiki
When we talk about grades, the difference feels even bigger
Kiki, I thought so too, but there are a lot of people with a bigger age gap than I thought!
That's right
There are quite a few brothers with a big age gap.
Yeah, and I think it's better to have siblings because you're less lonely as an only child.
Yeah, I think so too
Yeah, you think so too!
I think it's really hard to look after a baby
Seriously, even if it's my baby, I think I'll be really depressed if my life disappears even though I'm happy
That's right, the greater the happiness, the greater the hardship.
They say that raising children is real physical labor ㅜㅜ
Yeah, when I looked at your friend's baby pictures, she was really pretty, right?
But he really didn't listen... haha
My friend, it hurts my heart to see you having such a hard time.
Yeah, but I like parenting shows, so I liked The Return of Superman.
Kiki, it's cute and fun because I'm not the one raising the kids
Oh right Kiki
I liked all that Kiki
What program did Jeong Woong-in appear on?
Ah, daddy where are you kiki
Those are really legendary memes, they're so funny
It's really funny and the youngest is so cute
I liked him the most Kiki
Ah, is that Da-yoon, the cute baby? Kiki
Oh yeah, that's right, he's really still looking for it
It was the cutest thing in the real world
The little one loves to eat a lot
Yeah I'm eating that first one and you know this shaking video?
Total chaos Kiki
That's really so funny ㅜㅜ
Oh I know that Kiki
It's so funny, I'm laughing so hard.
Do you know the video of Dayoon's dad giving her a massage?
Dad, is this cool? Kiki
Hey, that's Kiki
When I asked the staff in front to do it, they said, &quot;Huh?&quot; That was the funniest thing.
Kiki is right, she's so cute
Yeah, yeah
That's so cute Kiki
These days, people raise many different kinds of animals.
Right, have you heard of water tech? Kiki
Water Tech, what is that?
They say that they raise fish and sell the babies when they hatch.
A lot of people do that?
Oh my gosh
I used to do that a lot when I was little!
Oh really?
I just heard it for the first time recently
Oh really?
But since they had so many children, the number of people who raised them also increased later on.
Oh yeah right
It's more substantial than I thought, Kiki
But the YouTuber I was watching said that he lost more money because he raised them wrong and many of them died for that purpose. Kiki
Wow, but raising fish also involves a lot of things to buy.
It's tricky because you have to adapt to their living environment.
Yeah, yeah, have you ever raised one?
I think I used to raise goldfish in a house
I've only raised goldfish~
There are so many pretty fish these days
I want to try raising one too!
I don't want to raise fish anymore
I want to raise an animal that I can touch
I think fish would be good for my peace of mind! Haha
I see
I want to raise an animal that I can communicate with!
I'll come visit you later when I raise you~ haha
Sister, have you ever gone fishing?
Oh, once
I tried it in Jeju Island!
How was it when you went fishing?
I stretched my ligaments with that, Kiki.
Oh, I think I heard that
Is it because I lifted my arms too hard?
Oh, it was my first time so I didn't know what to do and I think I just used my wrist too much...
I was preparing for my graduation performance and I panicked. ㅠㅠ
Oh, so how did the graduation concert go?
At that time, I had some time left until the performance, so I practiced while receiving treatment and wearing a wrist guard.
Luckily it wasn't that bad when I played it. Haha
That's a relief ㅜㅜ
I think I did it when I was young, but I don't remember
I want to try again
Right Kiki
I was really surprised...
If you get a chance to go to Jeju Island, try it!
I caught a mackerel and ate it right away. It was really delicious.
I don't have any plans to go fishing yet, but I'll do it when I have time!
Okay, okay
So have you been to the fishing cafe?
No, I haven't been there~
Have you been there, sister?
Yeah, I went there but I couldn't touch the fish so the owner kept taking them out... Kiki
I can't touch it either.
I don't think I'll be able to remove the ones that are stuck ㅜㅜ
Yeah, it's so gross!
Was there a computer game you liked when you were a kid?
I think I played a lot of Windy Kingdom and Maple Story!
you?
Oh, I know it all
I really liked Tales Runner.
I haven't done that!
That Alt-Beat? You know that game?
Oh, I've heard of it, but what was it?
It's like Kart Rider, but with people wearing skates!
I don't remember very well, Kiki
I loved that so much
You might have tried it too Kiki
Kiki, maybe it was
Or do you know that super game?
You know... you know that ramen shop?
Ahh Shu's Ramen Shop Kiki
I know, I know, it was fun
Honestly, I thought about it even after I became an adult
I wanted to do that sometimes
Kiki, is that game gone now?
Yeah, I think it disappeared ㅠㅠ
I'm really sorry Kiki
Animal Farm? I've done that a lot.
There are a lot of fun games on Naver
Oh my goodness, I loved Animal Farm so much.
Yeah, I played a lot of games on Naver
Yeah, I think everyone did that! Haha
When you travel, do you tend to look up good restaurants in advance?
Yeah, I do look it up in advance, but I ask the taxi drivers in the area.
Please tell me a really good restaurant
I went to Sokcho and went to a restaurant that was said to be delicious, but it wasn't delicious.
Really? I don't trust blogs. Kiki
There were too many ads, what is this?
That's why I always add &quot;my money, my country&quot; after the name of the restaurant I'm going to.
Then it's not an advertisement Kiki
This is a great tip, keep that in mind ^^
Kiki, who I bought with my own money, is cute
Kiki is really serious about food
I've had a lot of success that way, by asking taxi drivers or people around me, they'll tell me about good places!
Daebak, you're lucky
I'll try asking again.
Have you been to Gwangju?
Gwangju, Jeollanam-do!
No, you haven't been there?
Why? I went there on a field trip while participating in a project called Market Protection Corps to revitalize the market, and it was really nice. There were a lot of good restaurants.
Oh, I should go and play later!
Yeah, really, because of Corona, we can't operate a night market right now, but if it gets better, go next time.
I'll tell you about a good beer place haha
Oh good good
Traveling is always great!
That's right, let's travel freely, Corona~
When Corona is over, the four of us should go out and play!
Yeah, that's so good!
What season were you born, sister?
I was born in the dead of winter
you?
Oh, what month was it?
Me too, it's totally winter!
I'm in January!
You want me to guess?
It's December, right? Or not?
Yeah, yeah, we're one month apart ^^
Do I have a good memory?
Watch and learn!
I remembered it as soon as you asked!
People should be honest! Kiki
But they say people usually like the season they were born in, but I get cold so much that I honestly don't know if I like it
Kiki this is real
I also think spring and fall are the best
Do you know the song Winter Child?
Oh, I know, I know, it's the song that my friends sing and I sing on my birthday, Kiki
What season were you born, sister?
That's right, that's right, I was born in winter for nothing and liked that song
When I was young, I used to go to karaoke and sing a lot, Kiki
Kiki, that's right. That's a characteristic of people born in winter.
What season were you born, sister?
That's why everyone is cute, Kiki
Yeah haha it's really cute!
Yeah, we're so cute!
Do you know that Park Soo-hong is all the rage these days?
No, I don't think I saw it properly
what's the matter?
I married a woman who was a lot older than me.
Oh, you married a really young person?
Yeah, I think I was in my 20s...
Oh my... isn't that too much?
But they say that age doesn't matter, but I personally really can't understand it. The fact that they're interested in each other...
I'm the same age as my dad... I think I'd hate it so much
Oh, so that's it!
Don't you feel the generation gap?
That's right, I think there are quite a few celebrities who date people with a huge age gap.
I think it's hard to guess the age of celebrities.
We see so many people on TV every day who look younger than their age.
Yes, and especially since they have a lot of money, I think they often do it for money.
Yeah, I guess that's not the case. Something like that ㅠㅠ
I don't want to look at it negatively, but I think it has a big impact on ordinary people as well... When celebrities become an issue,
Yeah, yeah
This time, Ha Jung-woo's father was also involved in controversy because he got a 39-year-old woman pregnant. What was his name?
Ah, Kim Yong-geon!
Are you crazy?
Ah, right, right
That's even more shocking.
So it's really shocking.
Did you see what that Indian boy predicted?
Yeah, I saw it
It'll be okay starting in November!
Yeah, and I saw that they're going to take off their masks completely in May next year, I really hope that happens...
So honestly, I can't imagine a world where we can take off our masks now, but back then, I wonder how we could have worn masks? Kiki
Yeah, I guess it's become a habit to take off your mask when eating.
But I don't think I can take off my mask
The virus keeps mutating, so I don't think things will get any better next year...
I think so too
And they say that when corona gets better, another virus will appear ㅠㅠ
That's right, and there's also talk that as the glaciers melt, frozen ancient viruses will spread.
It's really scary...
Yeah, that gave me goosebumps when I heard that
Humans made everything like this ㅠㅠ
If I try my best from now on, will things be okay?
I don't know
I don't want to experience the destruction of the Earth... Kiki
Right ㅠㅠ
Anyway, that Indian boy's prophecy really came true a lot, so I hope it comes true this time too.
right
Yeah I hope this is true
Yeah, if that's true, I'll run away overseas right away!
I want to go out and play as much as I want ㅜㅜ
Good idea Kiki
Let's wait until November ㅠㅠ
Okay, let's wait until November!
Yeah, let's wait hard together!
Do you go to a beauty salon near your house?
I haven't been to a beauty salon near my house yet.
Then, should I keep going to other beauty salons?
Hmm, originally I only received it from the teacher I went to in Jinju and Ulsan...
I've only been to Seoul once
But it wasn't that great
Yeah, it's not that great, but there are a lot of them so it's okay, but you have to pick and go there.
What about you?
Do you have anywhere to go?
I always have a place to go!
Oh, that would be great!
Do you like it there?
Yeah, I like it so I always go there!
thank god
But Seoul beauty salons are really expensive Kiki
I go to places that are cheap, but I also go to Kiki
Oh I don't mind paying a little bit more, but please do it well Kiki
When I lived in Ulsan, I really liked my teacher. He was very thorough.
Okay, then I guess I'll have to find a better place now.
Yeah, I'm a beauty salon nomad right now
I guess I'm lucky that I'm growing my hair out now!
Yes, I absolutely have to get a perm, so a hair salon is important!
I see. Beauty salons are important!
What can we do to live a healthy life?
I think I can be healthy if I live like you... haha, exercise hard and eat well
Kiki but I eat a lot of things that are not good for my health ㅜㅜ
Oh right, but I forced myself to eat only healthy foods because of esophagitis, and I'm not happy...
That's right. If you live only for health, you won't be happy.
Yeah, but I think it's really good to exercise regularly!
Yes, I will continue to exercise in the future!
Yeah, yeah, I thought of you because there was a CrossFit right in front of my house.
Oh really? But I heard there are a lot of fake CrossFits.
They say real CrossFit has to be approved abroad.
Really? There's something like that?
That's new
Yeah, I'll have to look into it carefully.
I didn't know anything about CrossFit until I started coming here!
I see
I'm going to go climbing too!
Please cheer me on so I can have a great body
Okay, show me your fit body!
Yeah, you should exercise too and eat healthy food at least once a day.
Okay, I will do that from now on!
Yeah, try that!
Where to buy used cars?
There are many price comparison sites on the Internet, so don't you usually compare prices there before buying?
There are a lot of scams with used cars too.
Yeah, but I think you really have to be careful when it comes to second-hand transactions ㅠㅠ
That's right, they repair cars that have been in water or caught on fire and sell them at a regular price.
Oh right, they said you really have to be careful with the water truck!
I've traded used cars before, but I didn't know anything so I just bought it and it ended up having a lot of minor issues later on.
Oh really?
Sister, did you buy a used car? Why?
In Australia, it was hard to get around without a car, so I did my first transaction there and also drove.
Wow, you even traded cars overseas. That's amazing.
Did you buy it by talking directly in English?
No, I was dealing with a Korean.
I searched on the internet and met them to check, but I was scared ㅠㅠ
scared...
I have to take the man
It's dangerous to go alone...
That's right, but I didn't live alone, I lived with a friend!
When I looked into it, there were so many things to fix that the repair cost was more than the price of the car ^^
That's fortunate
You really have to do your research before buying a used car.
There was a show about how to look at cars well on a show like Life Master before, so I'll refer to it when I buy one later.
Really? Then you can just tell me after you see it haha!
No I don't like that haha
Yeah...ㅠㅠ
Okay, I'll look into it.
Do you watch TV often?
I haven't watched TV in a long time.
I think I watch it on YouTube a lot these days!
I also watch the variety shows I want to watch again on my phone and on YouTube!
Yeah, these days it's easy to rewatch everything on your phone, so I always watch it on my phone too!
Yeah and it's annoying
You can do it comfortably in your room by looking at it on your phone!
That's right. Once a drama ends, I binge-watch it on Netflix or something!
I hate waiting
Oh right, a lot of people use Netflix too.
I guess you don't use Netflix?
Then where do you usually meet?
I see you sometimes with my sister's ID
I also watched it with my family of 4
Have you seen any dramas that you enjoyed?
I don't watch dramas often because they're so long that I end up watching them all night long, so I haven't seen any dramas recently...
What about your sister?
I haven't seen it recently because I've been busy ㅠㅠ
But I heard there's a season 2 of Hospital Playlist, I want to watch that!
Yeah, that one too, they said it was all fun
Yes, I watched season 1 too!
I think I've seen all the Wise series.
Really? I didn't see it.
Really? See you later after the exam~
It's fun!
It seems like there are always a lot of horror movies coming out in the summer.
Yeah, I don't really watch horror movies because they scare me. Haha.
I don't watch horror movies because they're scary, but they're just scary and don't have any content, so they're not fun.
Watch a movie that scares people
But people are actually scarier than anything else Kiki
Have you seen the movie that actor Son Hyun-joo appears in?
It's something that is displayed in each apartment building
Oh, is that hide and seek?
Oh, that seems right.
That's why I always check next to the doorbell when I go home.
Oh my it's been so long I forgot
I saw that too and it was really scary...
I guess it must have been so impressive at the time that he started checking with me out of habit.
But there was talk of actually checking the number of people and their gender in that way.
Yeah, they said that they put a sign in every house where a woman lives alone.
When I watch movies like that, I get a little scared because I think real criminals would follow those methods.
But kids who commit crimes are going to do it anyway...
That's true too, Kiki
Anyway, I'm not good at watching horror movies or noir movies.
Then I'll have to take him and force him to see it.
It seems like there are always a lot of horror movies coming out in the summer.
Am I really going to have my eyes half closed?
That's okay though
It seems like there are always a lot of horror movies coming out in the summer.
It'll stick to you like gum haha!
Do you like desserts?
Yeah, I really like it. I told you yesterday that I wanted to eat red curry!
I want to eat that again today!
Me too ㅠㅠ I ate a notched donut yesterday and I think I could eat 3 while sitting down but I could only eat one and a half
I feel like I've just taken a shit...
So you didn't think about me when you ate?
I like desserts too, so think of me often. Then Kiki
Ah~ What are you talking about~ Of course I couldn't! ^^ Sorry, sorry.
I'll try to think about it next time!
I want to eat butter right now
You want that Noted Amber Butter Donut? Noted doesn't have mint chocolate? I wonder...
No, I just want a delicious anchovy butter scone.
There's mint chocolate in Noted, but the delivery menu is limited ㅠㅠ
Have you tried anything unusual like mint chocolate?
I had a mint chocolate protein cookie this morning and it's the best cookie I've ever had in my life...
Oh, just hearing it makes it sound delicious!
Mint chocolate soju? Honestly, it's crossing the line;
Have you tried it? I've only seen it, what are the reviews?
No I haven't tried it. It was just my guess haha
Oh, what the heck? I thought I crossed the line by eating it! Let's go eat it later and see what it's like.
Kiki, sorry for the confusion ^^! Okay.
We have a lot to eat next time. First, makgeolli and pajeon.
Then, then, can I add potato pancakes?
I'm having a hard time right now because I don't have enough potatoes. I really like potatoes. Kiki
Kiki, that's very possible!
Sister, you like corn and potatoes too? Then you like sweet potatoes too, right? Right?
Oh man, I got that wrong again. I don't really like sweet potatoes...
Does your sister decorate her house according to her taste?
If you look at my room, I'm completely out of my mind... No way! Did you decorate your room well?
Does your sister decorate her house according to her taste?
Sister, please take a look at my seat too. What do you think? Haha
There's just a place to put your feet and lie down~
I already knew that our place wasn't the only one in chaos...
So, if you could buy one prop, what would you decorate it with?
First of all, I'm going to get a pretty light! Just having a light makes the atmosphere come alive~
That's right! That's why I used a mood light humidifier to liven up the atmosphere. Kiki
But out of the blue, I really want to be independent.
Very strict, solemn and serious.
Seriously, when are you going to live with me?
As an independent senior, I've been waiting for you to come out for a long time!
Then please wait a little longer. &gt;&lt; I'll invite you as soon as I become independent!
Come out! I'm going to go play with some tissues and stuff!
I'm already excited^^ Just come here, unnie. I'll make you something delicious.
Oh, I'm going to add a gift to that now. What do you want?
I have so many, can you handle them?
I'll extract the list into Excel and send it to you haha &gt;
I can't afford it~
Just say one thing, just one thing...
You don't have to put in that much effort!
Then I'll wear cute pajamas &gt;
Then, can I go to my sister's house to play?
You can come to our house!
Come play across mountains and rivers~
Welcome!
Sister, do you like cars?
I think the Mini Cooper is pretty.
It's pretty, I like it! What about you?
Yeah, the Mini is pretty, but I heard it's not very cost-effective. Where can I get a car? Right?
I like SUVs.
Oh, I think SUV is fine too!
I heard that Ssangyong's Tivoli is good, so I wanted to buy that!
So we have a car license but are you thinking of buying a car?
My friend Tivoli is okay!
It would be convenient and nice to have a car, but
If I buy a car, I feel like I'll end up broke, just like I was before. What about you, sister?
Right! So I'm thinking about resigning.
How can I overcome my fear of driving?
Oh, then that's right! My friend is such a coward, but he practices little by little every day and now he's becoming the best driver!
Really? I want to practice too!
But isn't parking too difficult, let alone driving?
That's right. I used to be really good at parking games on my phone, so I was confident, but real life is so different. After all, life is real life, right?
Okay, okay! My dad taught me how to park, but it was actually my dad who parked the car.
I guess it's too stuffy I'm Kiki
Kiki, did your dad teach you how to drive well?
I learned it from my mom once and I'll never ride with her again haha you know why?
My mom won't let me drive her car. You know why, right?
I'm good at braking though...
After all, family is family~ ^^!
If you hold the brakes well, I honestly think you're more than halfway there.
So, even though I stepped on it really gently, my mom kept saying things like...
Actually, it seems like my dad did the driving too!?
How about you learn to drive quickly first and then teach me...?
Kiki Oh, I don't know how fast it will be, but if you're ready, give it a try! See you in about five years!
No way... I guess it'd be faster if I became the best driver first haha
These days, we can't have company dinners. What do you think?
I don't mind not being able to have company dinners, but I really don't like not being able to do things with my friends or colleagues!
Me too ㅠㅠ I'm really sad that I can't have a cold drink of soju with my colleagues after work.
Yeah! It's a bit fun to come out to work for that reason.
I want to talk to my colleagues, but is it really this hard?
So, it's love for one's motives, love for one's country, and love for one's colleagues. Right?
That's why lunch time is so precious.
Then, there are also times when I leave the company to have fun during lunch time!
So, are you having a nice time chatting with your colleagues during lunch?
Yeah, yeah. I'm a chatterbox, so I actually feel like lunch time is too short and I regret it. Do you know, Unnie? I know everything.
I knew we were the same type of people, me too Kiki
I'm really chatty...
I'm the type of person who gets hoarse from talking so much, but I can't talk much while I'm working, so I'm having a hard time right now.
Instead, your throat must be fresh these days! Then, what time do you leave home for work?
I catch the bus around 7:15!
So, get off early and enjoy some leisure time...
Do you tend to leave work early?
What a great guy who enjoys his free time!
If I leave around 7:30, I arrive at the office just in time.
Any earlier than that... it's hard hehe...
It takes forever to get to work ㅜㅜ
But I'm still close by... So I guess I'll mostly take the subway in the morning?
Yeah ㅠㅠ That's why my legs hurt so much.
And the subway is always indoors so it's so stuffy, ugh~ ㅠㅠ
I like looking outside...
Right! But you said there's no bus and it takes a long time?
Yeah ㅠㅠ The bus doesn't even run once an hour so I don't know if they're going to pick up passengers or not haha
Sister, if the bus doesn't get stuck, we'll get there soon!?
Yeah, I can get to Gangnam Station in 30 minutes if the driver keeps driving!
Medical accidents in the military recently? I heard about that? ㅠ
No? What the heck, a medical accident?
I hope it works out well...
The most recent musical I saw was a military musical. Have you seen it too?
Oh, I saw a military musical too. What did you see, Sister?
I saw the military musical called Return that was on until last year. Did you see that too?
Oh no! I saw a musical called Shinheung Military Academy.
I saw Kang Ha-neul and Onew. What about you, Unnie?
I saw Xiumin, Sunggyu, and actor Kim Minseok! They all sang well~
But I guess Shinheung Military Academy doesn't have military uniforms, right?
No, I'm wearing it? Oh, it's not a military uniform, but should I say a military academy uniform...?
I think so haha
Ah, the return is completely current, I'm out in my military uniform and wearing a beret!
Oh, that would make it more realistic!
Kang Ha-neul's acting was so good that I cried a lot too~
No, Kang Ha-neul is good at singing too. I wonder.
But On-yu appeared in Return and Shinheung Military Academy too, so it feels like he's been around for a long time... Kiki
You're practically a military musical craftsman, aren't you?
Yeah, yeah Kang Ha-neul is good at singing and acting, I was touched!
It's fiction, but it's so touching...
That's right, the middle-aged actor's acting was really good, so I shed some tears on the second floor too... ㅜㅜ
Do you plan on going to see the military musical again?
Yeah, I totally do! I like musicals too, so I totally do. What about you, sister?
I totally have that too!
I also like musicals, so I watch them all if I can, regardless of the genre!
My friend said he didn't want to see it because of the gunshots... ㅜㅜ
Oh my gosh ㅠㅠ That's right, I guess it's because it's the military ㅠㅠ
But isn't it cool to carry a gun and serve in the military?
Yeah, that's right! I was really scared when I saw him wielding a gun and doing military service, but it was really cool!
Sister, do you have any memorable teachers?
Oh! I still keep in touch with my academy teacher from middle school!
Isn't it amazing that you can go home and sleep and stuff?
Wow, this is awesome!
I met my homeroom teacher from my second year of high school a while ago!
Oh! I'm only close with my academy teacher, and he's the only subject teacher I ever got a perfect score on.
The teacher said I was pretty Kiki
Wow, 100 points! Cool! I'll try to guess.
Sister, is that subject math?
Oh, sweet potatoes were wrong, and this is wrong too... Society, society!
Ta-da ^^ I'm good at making mistakes~
You and your teacher have such a deep connection!
Yeah! So, is your homeroom teacher from your second year of high school the teacher you remember the most?
Yeah! I'm an English teacher. When I was in the second year of high school, we were all close and united in the class, so when we were twenty, we all went on a trip together~!
Oh, with the teacher? Awesome!
It's my first time hearing about a trip with my homeroom teacher!
He must have been a really good teacher...
I didn't like any of my high school teachers...
That's right ㅠㅠ It's really hard to meet a good teacher who fits well.
He was a teacher who would sing the song of the teacher's grace without realizing it haha. Of course, I only sang it in my mind.
No, why did you only call me in your mind?
When I sing, I remember my high school senior homeroom teacher singing a congratulatory song when he got married. I really sang it.
I don't remember the teacher very well, but I remember singing that congratulatory song very well, Kiki
Wow, awesome! So cute and heartwarming. &gt;
Half of us are singing the congratulatory song together ㅠㅠ
Oh, was that your solo song?
Of course the kids all sang! Kiki
At that time, my homeroom teacher was about 28 years old, but now that I think about it, even the teachers were young... ㅜㅜ
Wow ㅠㅠ That's right... Getting married at a similar age to me...
I guess it must have been really hard for teachers younger than me, now that I think about it...
That's why I should have listened to you back then.
Thinking about it now, I feel a bit adolescent and I'm sorry for not listening to you...
How many people are in your family, sister?
I have 4! You?
Oh me too! Dad, Mom, Brother, Me. What about Sister?
Me too, exactly the same!
Then is there a big age difference between you and your brother?
I'm 4 years older than you! What about your sister?
I'm exactly the same.
The 4 year age gap isn't that big or small, but I wish my older brother was my younger brother.
Really? I already feel like my brother is my brother, so I wish he would act like my brother a little bit haha
Oh really?
But now that I think about it, my brother often gives me a lot of allowance, so I think it's okay for him to just be my brother...
Oh, then yes. The person who gives money is the best!
The best the best!
I'm suddenly curious, what kind of gift do you think would be good for my mom's 60th birthday?
Well... It's really hard to give a gift to anyone.
How about cash? Wrap it up nicely and make it look like an event!
After all, there's nothing better than cash, right?
I asked because my mom's birthday is coming up soon haha
Yes, I think cash is the best, regardless of age or gender!
Tell your mom that she's still a little bit away from her birthday, but she's happy! Haha &gt;
Kiki, there's a little left, but I'll tell you!
So, are you planning to give your mother some cash for her next birthday?
Yeah! That's the plan, but first of all, my mom's birthday is next year.
Mom, wait~ ^^
My mom will have to wait a bit too, but thank you anyway!
Sister, have you ever been on a blind date?
No, I'm the type that seeks natural encounters! Have you tried it?
Oh, I'm also proud! ^^
I almost accepted it a few times, but I declined because I felt burdened...
But when I look around, I see that these days, kids are having a hard time meeting people naturally, so they all go on blind dates. But for me, meeting people I don't know like that is so awkward and hard to even think about.
Then what is your ideal type?
Yes, that's exactly why.
I want someone who looks good in glasses, isn't thin, is polite, and has a similar sense of humor to me &gt;&lt; What about you, Unnie?
It's very specific. It's very specific.
I think I like someone who makes me feel like, &quot;Oh, this person has a lot to learn!&quot;
Oh, right, that point is important too!
Then tell me about the external things too! I'm curious &gt;
I think I like someone with a round face. Like Do Kyungsoo? Isn't Do Kyungsoo okay?
It's completely fine.
I really liked Do Kyungsoo when I was in 3rd year of high school haha
I like people like Lee Jang-won. Do you know Lee Jang-won?
I think Do Kyungsoo is good right now. Kiki
Isn't that the guy who plays the guitar? Isn't that the smart guy?
Yeah, that's right! The exterior is also my style and we have similar tastes in comedy ㅠㅠ
At first glance, it seems like a common type, but you never see it around you.
Are you the guy who came out of the escape room with Ha Seok-jin and Kim Ji-seok? Are you wearing glasses?
Oh right, my ideal type is someone who looks good with glasses! They fit me perfectly!
So you found your ideal type, Kiki
That's right! That's him!
Being smart is attractive, but it's also so funny and cute &gt;,
Then what part of your sister do you find attractive?!
When I feel like this person is listening to everything I said? I think so!
When you feel that connection... is that charm?
Then that's charm! How many people are there who don't listen to others and only talk about themselves! Haha
Right? That's right, then it's right to feel attracted to that!
Isn't my profile picture cute? These are my animal friends &gt;
Yeah, I wish you could change your profile picture every day.
I want to see new photos every day!
Kiki I'll show you a new picture every day!
Who is the cute puppy in your sister's profile picture?
Oh, this is Nurungji! My friend's dog is yellow, so he's called Nurungji Kiki
The name is perfect, isn't it?
It's so cute and suits you so well ㅠㅠ
So is Nurungji a Pomeranian?
that's right!
But compared to other Pomeranians, Kiki's legs are really long.
Running around, running around!
So, barley is named barley because of its color?
That's right! When Bori came to our house as a baby, I saw his tail and it reminded me of Bori, so I named him Bori! Did I name him well!? &gt;,
It's a perfect match! It's a perfect match!
Since Pomi is white, I want to call it Baekseolgi Chapssaltteok...haha Chapssaltteok!
Yes, our Pomi is white and pink &gt;,
Pomi has many names such as Pomi, Pomi, Pig, Baby, etc.
They call their pets babies... They really are like babies!
Did Pomi practice this by sitting on his hands and knees?
That's right. Even when you grow up, you're still a baby... &gt;
Yeah yeah our Pomi knows how to do sit, lie down, hands, turn around, V, and wait.
Barley doesn't do anything. Haha
Oh my gosh, V... ㅜㅜ Can you please record a video and show me later!
I'll show you!
When you make a V with your thumb and index finger, it's so cute when you put your chin there &gt;,
That would be really cute!
I really want to see it, it's my first time hearing about V-Rain!
But aren't cats originally animals that are difficult to train?
Yeah, I guess so!
The cat seems to think that he understands everything but what can I do? Haha
I think cats are really proud, even if they are dogs! Haha
Sister, do you like fishing?
Fishing I went to a fishing cafe a long time ago and tried it once...
Do you like fishing? Do you do it often?
No, I'm just impatient, waiting around was just too much torture... ㅠ
Oh, but I tried it and it didn't work?
Yeah! My grandmother loved fishing, so we used to do it with our family often when I was little!
I think I had some fun with it when I was younger...
Wow, a fishing grandma. How romantic!
I tried it for the first time then and it was the first time I felt the taste of the hand Kiki
Have you caught a lot of meat?
Oh, the taste~ Kiki
Yeah, yeah. Thanks to my grandmother, I think I've tried saltwater fishing, freshwater fishing, and ice fishing.
Do you like any other sports?
No, I don't really like exercising, but I like swimming!
Do you know how to freestyle?
Wow! I love water, but I can barely paddle...
Do you like hiking?
No, it's been a while since I went hiking, and I don't even go up the hill in front of my house...
So have you been hiking recently?
I'm having a hard time too, not really... hehe
I went to Hallasan four years ago, but it was so hard that I never want to go again!
So, personally, I think mountain climbing is too difficult...
I guess we should just start from the mountain behind the neighborhood...
But why is it Mt. Halla so suddenly?
That's why. I didn't know that a tiger could be so scary when it was only a little hill behind the house!
So, do you like camping?
Kiki seems like she'd enjoy camping, but... I've never actually tried it.
Does camping include car camping?
I want to try a little bit of car camping!
Then let's include car camping too!
I'm also curious about car camping. I'm worried about sleeping in a small space and feeling a little uncomfortable, but it sounds like fun!
I saw people on TV doing car camping, and it looks really pretty when they decorate it, so I want to try it someday!
Does your sister like games?
I don't hate it, I don't like it!
I guess you could call it a rhythm game, but I only like that Kiki
Oh, I like rhythm games too!
R2Beat, audition, etc. What else is there?
But isn't something like Tapsonic also a rhythm game?
Oh, right, right! Is that a really old game?
Right, that's not what they're doing, but they're doing something similar to that, so you don't know?
Yeah. I don't know much about the game called Shusm...
Is that a phone game? A computer game?
It's a phone game! I started playing it because my friend started it. It's like tapsonic, with the rhythm of the song~
I've been doing this for quite some time, so I'm pretty high level Kiki
Oh~ Cool ^^ Then do you like board games too?
Yeah! I like Lumikub. What about you?
I don't know how to play Lumikub... I like Halli Galli!
Halli Galli is so much fun!
It took me a while to learn Lumikub too, it was hard...
Should I teach you something?
Yeah! Teach me! Promise, promise!
I will learn and become a disciple who can overcome his master!
Of course, I'm not that good of a teacher, but I'll try my best...
First of all, where can I get a Lumikub? Do I have to go to a board game cafe?
Um... maybe?
Then, when social distancing is lifted, let's go to a board game cafe too~ Promise, promise!
We have so many places to go, don't forget Kiki
Is there something you always take with you when you travel?
Make sure to bring your medicine... and a rosary or something.
Are you a bit of a coward?
Not a coward, but a man of sense~ ^^
I'm also taking some medicine and bandages!
Actually, I don't think there's anything special because I usually have a lot of luggage haha
You're carrying a lot of luggage, Kiki, you know that
I feel like I have everything.
Have you ever traveled alone?
No. I usually walk around alone, and I've walked around alone for about half a day, but I don't think I've ever done it alone.
What about your sister?
I'm good at walking around by myself, but I've never gone out and slept!
Oh, just like me!
Then, are you willing to go on a trip alone and just sleep over?
Yeah! I made a lot of plans, but they didn't work out?...
As expected, a coward...
If you go alone, do you want to travel to Jeju Island?
Well, I want to go to Korea at least, even if it's not necessarily Jeju Island!
I think it would be a bit scary and boring to go abroad alone! What about you, sister?
As expected, cowards travel domestically too...
Traveling abroad is more fun when you go with friends. I don't want to travel abroad alone!
Exactly! That's exactly what I thought ^^
So, is there something you always buy when you travel?
I think I bought some chocolate and a magnet!
A gourmet never misses out on anything to eat...
You probably bought some chocolate too, right?
Then, then! And in Jeju Island, you must try Omegi Tteok!
It's so delicious &gt;,
I haven't tried omegi tteok! Is omegi tteok good?
Do you have any red beans?
That's right! There's red bean inside and it's wrapped in whole red beans on the outside!
I like red beans. What about you, sister?
I don't like red beans, but I like sirutteok. Is it similar?
There's been rumors of rain, but it's not actually raining?
Oh, you said it was going to rain today? I didn't know!
Do you usually check the weather forecast?
Yeah! My nickname is *Siri, so I check the weather forecast every day!
You take good care of it!
But I think I told you last time that it was going to rain
So I thought you weren't watching... haha
Oh, because I take good care of it
It's up to me whether I bring an umbrella or not haha. Unnie, take good care of it?
I live alone so I really don't pay attention to the rain!
That's why I always have an umbrella by my side!
Are you an umbrella fairy?
So, are you afraid of thunder and lightning?
No! I'm not scared.
But I'm so scared of the wind. Are you okay with the wind?
Oh, strong man.
But even I, the wind and rain can't stop me.
How are your eyes?
It's scary when it snows now because the traffic is so congested...
I used to like snow, but not anymore.
That's right. Neither rain nor wind can stop me, but snow can stop me.
Do you like snowball fights?
Has it been so long since we had a snowball fight?
Are you still having a snowball fight?
No, actually, it's been a really long time for me too...
But I liked it.
How about making a snowball fight?
Now it's cold so I don't want to go out... Kiki
The best way to enjoy snow is from the veranda!
That's right! I like just looking at the snow and rain from inside.
That's right, now you can watch the babies playing indoors~
Is next week finally the vaccine application period for people in their 20s and 30s?
Yeah, we're finally getting our shots!
But if I apply this time, will it be in September?
Yeah, I'm not sure, but I think it might have been like that!
Sister, what day is your application due?
I think it's August 12th? You?
I'm 9 days old!
It's the first day of the application period, so I'm so nervous... What should I do...?
Is it okay to just apply for the date of vaccination and the hospital?
I'm trying to have some hope that the server won't go down anymore.
I'll have to look into the exact procedure again.
After getting vaccinated, I want to rest until the next day. Right?
Yeah! That's right, but if I'm sick the next day and have to go to work, it's going to be so hard...
What day do you plan to apply?
Friday and Saturday would be nice, but I'm worried it'll be really crowded... What about you, Unnie?
I want to meet you on Friday night too, but I don't know if I can ㅜㅜ
It shouldn't hurt, but we're getting Pfizer, right?
Yeah! This time, it's Pfizer and Moderna!
Is there anyone around you who has been vaccinated?
My friend works at a hospital and got AstraZeneca.
My friend said there were no side effects other than a slight fever.
I hope there's nothing wrong with me, I'm scared of side effects... ㅜㅜ
My mom also got AstraZeneca!
I heard you had a bit of a cold for a day or two ㅠㅠ
Oh, my mom was nothing but tired...
We'd like it to just go quietly... right?
So! ㅠㅠ Let's hope we're both okay!
Well then, I hope you succeed in applying for the vaccine and give me some tips!
The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Tokyo has exceeded 5,000...
Really? It's the Olympics, is that okay...?
Yeah, I guess it increased because of the Olympics...
I'm also really worried about our country's athletes...
So, it seems like there is some group infection among the Olympic athletes.
Can I continue, please...?
Oh my gosh... What should I do...
Everyone needs to come back safely ㅠㅠ
That's why I'm worried.
I'm watching the Olympic volleyball, and I think they might make it to the finals, so I hope they make it to the end without any problems...
I know.
Health comes before grades!
I wish they had paid a little more attention to quarantine...
So, really, wherever you go, Corona is causing trouble.
So, since we were talking about volleyball earlier, did you watch the volleyball game against Turkey yesterday?
No, I didn't see it, I just saw the highlights!
It was really so dramatic!?
I only watched the highlights, but they came back from behind in the last set and won again!
I think my heart would have hurt if I had seen that live...
Yeah, it's so cool! ㅠㅠ
You must be really nervous at a world-class competition... right?
I absolutely can't... ㅜㅜ
I even saw a news report that said that the Turkish athletes wanted to do better after the recent fire in Türkiye.
It was a little heartbreaking, but I'm glad we won!
Yeah, I heard that news too... ㅠㅠ
It hasn't evolved yet...
This is really a big deal
Still? Oh, I didn't know that...
Hasn't the fire been burning for several days?
Yeah, that's right ㅠㅠ
I hope it evolves quickly and causes fewer casualties!
Ah, I didn't know because I didn't watch Turkish news properly, but it seems more serious...
Sister, is there anything you care about aesthetically?
I always spray perfume!
I think you care the most about perfume.
I used to wear makeup, but now I hardly ever wear makeup.
I originally didn't wear much makeup, but I think I don't wear it even more now.
When you put on makeup, where do you put the most effort?
I'm into lip these days!
I don't think people are buying a lot of different things these days because of the masks ㅠㅠ
What about your sister?
Ah, when I put on makeup, I put the most effort into eyeshadow!
I think I used about 5 colors?
Oh, you use it a lot!
Do you like shiny pearls?
Yeah I use glitter so my eyes look bigger now so I use glitter with small particles!
What brand do you mainly use?
Oh~ I don't really have a favorite brand, but I think MAC lip products are the best because they are versatile and come in a variety of colors.
What about your sister?
Yeah, I mainly use Peripera for my lips.
I like the color there
I use a type of lip product called Airy Velvet.
Have you tried it?
I used it once a long time ago!
So, do you like tints or lipsticks?
I really hate that dry feeling so I don't really wear lipstick!
you?
Oh, I on the contrary like matte lips and I like lipstick more than tint!
Oh, that's totally the opposite of me!
That's why I always apply Nivea.
Have you seen me apply it often?
Oh really?
I got it now! ^^
My lips aren't that dry, so I don't really use lip balm haha
I've had dry skin since I was a student, so I still keep applying it!
Are there any little habits you do for your health?
I tend to go to bed early...
Do you know what time I sleep?
Yeah, I know!
I think sleep is really important.
I slept late so my stamina is like this...
You seem to go to bed late and wake up early.
So you might be more tired
I feel healthier if I sleep 7 hours a day...
Do you have a habit?
I drink a lot of water.
But rather than saying it's a habit, I'm just someone who drinks a lot!
Oh, that's a really good habit.
I'm worried because I don't drink enough water!
So how much do you drink a day?
I'm not sure, but I think I always drink more than a liter!
Sister, try increasing it little by little!
I don't think I drink even 500 ml while I'm working.
Is it okay to drink carbonated water?
Carbonated water is also good.
But is it bad for your teeth if you consume too much carbonated beverages?
I'm not sure... haha
I can't drink plain water.
You need to put in something, even a tea bag, so that some water can go in...
My friend also drinks tea or soda because of that!
Then let's do some stretching often!
I really need to stretch
Then, when you do stretching, take me with you.
Yeah yeah I'll tell you!
It's good to just turn your neck often!
Really? My wrists and back are not in good shape.
Tell me some stretching related to this!
Yeah! I'll teach you some wrist stretches too.
Let's do it together and take care of our health ^^
okay!
Then stretching only trusts you!
Sister, do you use Market Kurly well?
I used it once last month and it was good
Great for people who live alone!
Yeah. Early morning delivery is really convenient.
What about Coupang?
I don't use Coupang much anymore!
Dawn delivery is okay too~
Oh, thanks for the recommendation!
I'll try using SSG next time!
What do you usually order?
Just order something to eat!
Frozen dumplings or meal kit?
Have you tried a meal kit?
no!
Is it that comfortable?
What kind of food is there?
I had gambas and pasta and it was really delicious and cheap!
It's a presage, so please use it at least once!
Oh, I love gambas.
thank you!
Have you ever ordered something like a frozen lunch box?
I don't order frozen lunch boxes very often because they don't taste good!
Are frozen lunch boxes okay?
I tried it once and never tried it again... haha
First of all, the quantity is too small!
Ah, if the amount is too small, you are eliminated.
The meal kit is basically for two people, so be sure to order it!
Okay, okay!
Frozen lunch boxes are small in size and taste so healthy...
Yeah, that's why I stopped eating it
Bibigo is delicious too, so order that too...
Okay! Next time I'll definitely order Bibigo.
Yeah, I can guarantee the taste!
Sister, do you have a favorite celebrity?
Oh I really like EXO!
Oh, who do you like the most?
I like Do Kyungsoo the most, but I actually like them all!
So what’s your favorite EXO song?
You know the winter song called Universe?
I absolutely love that song!
Then what is your favorite Do Kyung Soo movie?
That thing that comes out with Jo Jeong-seok, hyung!
Oh, I know, I know!
You're really good at acting.
I think Do Kyungsoo's voice is really nice. Don't you think so?
Okay then
I started liking EXO after hearing that voice...
Have you ever heard Do Kyungsoo pronounce English?
Oh, I heard.
It was really great ^^
Do Kyungsoo's face is nice too, right?
Then your face is the best
Round face is the best the best!
He's handsome but small, so he looks like a fairy, right?
You may be a little smaller than me, but that's nothing Kiki
Please keep loving me hard!
Then I will continue to like you like a sunflower!
Sister, do you like Marvel movies?
I love it so much I've seen it all!
you?
I saw it all too!
Do you like Captain America?
Yeah I like it, but I think Iron Man is the best!
Yeah but I like Thor too
Ah, I don't really like Thor!
I like Spiderman too.
Yeah, me too.
What about Doctor Strange?
Doctor Strange is a somewhat forgotten hero...
I think I forgot a little bit.
Don't forget!
I actually like Rocky.
Ah, Rocky, the movie is coming out soon!
So I hope it comes out quickly!
I'm waiting too
The Marvel universe is absolutely the best!
That's right, that's right! This time, let's look at Black Widow too!
Oh right, I have to see that.
Was it fun?
Yeah, it's totally fun!
I hope you see it before you go down!
Yeah! I'll definitely watch Black Widow!
Do you want to go for a beer this evening?
Beer is totally good!
What kind of beer do you like?
I like lagers~
What kind of food do you like to eat with beer?
Well, I actually like everything with beer, so I like eating it with snacks, tteokbokki, pizza, etc.
Have you ever ordered beer along with your food delivery?
Yeah, I ordered draft beer with my chicken once, but it wasn't as good as eating it in the restaurant ㅠㅠ
Have you ever ordered it?
No I don't have any
I didn't feel like drinking it because I thought it would definitely taste bad if I came that way. I like beer so I didn't feel like drinking it.
What do you usually drink beer with?
I also like eating pizza or chicken, and sometimes I just drink beer while watching TV!
Do you usually eat late-night snacks?
I love late night snacks
It's good to just think about it, but I don't eat well so I have trouble digesting it...
What would be good for a late night snack?
I like chicken feet!
Ramen tastes good when you eat it at night, but your face will be puffy in the morning.
Chicken feet, my mouth is watering haha
I like it a lot too
And I highly recommend the gopchang too
Don't you like that either?
Oh, I like tripe too...
Let's go eat gopchang next time!
There is a good restaurant in Seolleung Station
Do you want to go right now?
Then do you like beef tripe or pork tripe?
I like beef tripe!
Pigs smell so I don't like them...
you?
You have a weak stomach
I like both without any distinction
What are you planning to eat for dinner tonight?
So, shall we have pizza and beer for dinner tonight?
Totally good
Definitely call!
My house lease is about to end, so I have to find a new house to move into ㅠㅠ
Oh really?
What house are you going to go to next?
I'm thinking about buying a house next time!
I thought it would be nice to have a yard
A house with a yard is nice!
But those houses are so expensive that it's hard to find them
I need to look into it carefully and buy it.
Are you interested in real estate?
I don't know much about it, but I've been trying to take an interest in it lately!
how about you?
You can say that I don't know much
I'm not even that interested Kiki
It's still too difficult...
There is no such thing as a dream of owning a home
I have that dream too...
Since house prices keep rising, I'm wondering if I should buy or sell now~
Don't you think you'll buy a house someday?
Should I buy a house?
I want it too much
But realistically, the difficulties are so great that I feel like I've given up from the start?
Since housing prices are cheaper in the provinces than in the metropolitan area, have you ever thought about moving there?
If it was the province, I would have bought it sooner.
I've always lived in Seoul and everything is in Seoul, so I never imagined living in the countryside ㅠㅠ
Are you thinking of living in another area?
Well, I'm interested in real estate, so I haven't looked into it properly, but I compared it and it's much cheaper, and the house is big, so if you like it, you might want to go.
So are you looking for a rental for your next house?
I need to find out about both rent and sale~
I think it would be nice to buy a house because I can decorate it the way I want.
Yeah, I think I'd be really happy decorating my house.
So what style of interior do you want to do?
I think I'd be fine with just making it bright and clean!
Even if some time passes, it won't become a trend haha
Do you like decorating your room or something like that?
I like it, but since I don't live alone, I haven't been able to decorate it the way I want.
That's also why I want to buy my own house.
Are you good at dressing up?
No, I also want to dress up my heart well, but I don't think I have the sense to do that, Kiki
If you do it later, you should leave it to an interior design company~
I hope you decorate your house well and have the interior you want!
It's so hot these days that it's hard to commute to work by public transportation, right?
Oh right, I totally agree. I get tired just going to work.
Don't you plan on going by car?
I wonder if I won't be able to take it around here because the traffic is so congested and parking will be difficult?
You have a long way to go, so it would be more convenient to go by car.
It's a long distance, so traffic congestion will be worse on the way there.
I looked it up and it said it takes the same two hours.
Do you think you'd still go by car?
If the time is the same, it would be better to just rest and look at my phone on the way there ㅠㅠ
If only I could just sit down and come!
Yeah that's why I just came while sleeping haha
If I could, I would like to buy a plane and commute to work on it...
Even if you make Kiki, where are you going to put it?
If you have one, there are a lot of places you can go around.
That's why I can't prepare... haha
There are so many electric cars these days. Don't you want to have one?
I'm a bit curious! It can drive autonomously too~
When I change my car later, I should consider an electric car too haha
How about an electric car?
I'm not sure yet
When I walk down the street and see it, I'm often startled because the sound is so quiet. When I see something like that, it seems dangerous.
Did you know that the country supports you?
Yeah! But they don't support all of that either...
They don't support cars that are a bit more expensive ㅠㅠ
Of course I don't have the money to buy that, but Kiki
Oh right, that's what I heard
So I don't have my first car yet, so I'm thinking of just buying a used car later.
If it's your first time, a compact car would be better, right?
It might be easy to drive, but it's a bit dangerous if you have to drive on highways or something!
Don't look for something too small, something like a mid-sized sedan.
Oh, is that so?
If your car is small, it might be scary to drive on the highway.
If you drive a big car, there are no restrictions and you won't be ignored haha
Well, actually, it's easier to drive a big car because the field of vision is higher. Parking is difficult though.
If you pick a car, give me a ride~!
I don't know when that will be, but when I get a car, let's go play!
Did you have a lot of company dinners when you were working at your previous company?
I've ordered food and had drinks at the office a lot, but I haven't had many separate company dinners.
But I actually like it better because I don't end up drinking too much!
Have you done a lot?
Wow, that's great!
Yeah, I do it often, and when I do, they make me drink a lot, so it's a bit difficult ㅠㅠ It's an extension of work.
Well then, I don't hate it so much. I just wish companies had set working hours.
Wasn't the work very tough?
Yeah, work was tough.
If they had paid me a bit more, I might have tolerated it, but that wasn't the case, haha
I wish there was a company that didn't have hard work and paid a lot of money~
Hey buddy, it's about time you knew, right?
A company like that doesn't exist in this world ^^
Have you ever had a hard time because of people at work?
^^ Haha I know...
There were some not so good people too
If you're having a hard time because of people rather than your actual work, it seems like there's no answer ㅠㅠ
Yeah, most of it is hard because of people.
I used to be like that too, and I hate meeting people who don't fit in so well.
Yeah, I don't even want to look at your face.
But I'm glad I don't see it anymore!
Have you ever negotiated your salary at work?
No, I worked at a place where the salary was fixed.
Have you tried it?
Yeah, that's right. I did it, but it was really hard.
I think the world is more comfortable when things are just fixed
Isn't that a negotiation? It's not a negotiation. It's just following the company's rules? Kiki
Yeah, I pretty much just did whatever the company told me to do.
Kiki, I don't think your opinion was reflected
Yeah, but I think it would feel good if they kept raising it little by little under the pretext of negotiation!
Then I'll have some fun going to work
It's really hard being a salaried worker... ^^
Have you ever seen a program called Steel Troops?
Oh, I didn't see that, but I heard there was quite a bit of talk about it
Do you know a real man similar to that?
Yeah, that's something celebrities go and experience!
This is a competition between ordinary reservists who form teams within the same unit. Special forces compete against each other.
Oh, then it will be more realistic and immersive. It will be a completely vicarious experience!
Yeah, it's survival so it's really fun Kiki
Did you like the program Real Men?
I didn't watch it every time, but it was famous at one time, so I watched it a few times!
But it was still fun
I've been thinking about trying chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear warfare training. What do you think?
Oh. I'm curious but I don't want to do it haha
Are you all in so much pain?
Yeah, it's painful, I want to try it Kiki
I think if you do something extreme, you'll see the world differently.
Haven't you heard from people around you who have tried it?
Yeah, come to think of it, I've never heard of chemical, biological, radiological warfare talk before?
I want to try it because I'm in pain
No, I just want to experience this once.
When you overcome pain, you grow as a person ^^
Military life will probably become a little easier.
That's right, after you overcome something incredibly difficult, nothing else will feel like that!
I have a friend who served in the Air Force and he said it was good because he got a lot of vacation time.
Oh really? That's the first time I found out about that.
Have you ever met your friends from the military when you were on leave?
What did you play?
Yeah, I just drank alcohol and ate delicious food~
There were a lot of things I wanted to eat inside, the soldiers Kiki
Well, when you go on vacation after a long time, it's a whole new world for them haha
If I were to join the military, what position do you think would suit me best?
Hmm. I think administrative soldier Kiki would be a good fit.
you?
I'd like to try cooking for all those people. I think it would be satisfying to cook for that many people!
I thought taking exams and getting certifications was the end of my student years, so why am I still doing it?
That's because we chose this path. Haha.
I hope you do well. What subjects were you good at when you were young?
I was good at science and liked it, but I was bad at math, so I just chose liberal arts.
Now that I think about it, I think I made a wrong choice Kiki
you?
I'm bad at neither science nor math. I'm definitely more of a liberal arts major. I did a bit of Korean.
So you think I should have gone into science?
If only I had studied math a little harder, I think I would have just gone to science!
I never really thought of myself as a liberal arts major ㅠ
Then, were you good at English or other foreign languages besides Korean?
How could that be? I'm a native Korean, so I'm not really interested in foreign languages. But I think it would be really useful if I learned it.
Don't you study foreign languages?
Yeah, I'm not doing it now, but when I watch Midna or something like that, I want to study English a bit more and watch it without subtitles!
Yeah, I've been learning English since elementary school, but it's still a lifelong challenge.
Are you capable of having a simple conversation?
Yeah, it's no problem when you go on a trip or something like that!
I think I'm good at listening, but speaking is really difficult ㅠㅠ
how about you?
Oh, then you're not good at it?
I have a problem but it's not a problem Kiki
I can't speak, but I use my hands, feet, and face, and most of all, I think speaking English is a confidence thing.
Oh, that's right! Even if you're not good at it, if you just say it the way it is, they'll understand everything Kiki
Later, when I have some time, I think I'll go to a conversation school
But these days, things like YouTube and online lectures are so well-established that it may be difficult to make time to go to an academy.
How was your English grade when you were in school?
My English grades weren't bad, but even though I kept studying, they didn't really go up much ㅠㅠ
Yeah, there's a lot of stuff on YouTube these days.
It's not easy to improve your English grades, and it's not even your native language.
Wouldn't it be okay to study with like-minded people by watching something like YouTube?
I think that would be good, but it's hard to meet people these days, so I'll have to think about that when the coronavirus situation is over.
There are a lot of people with Corona. I hope you can study English with peace of mind!
Did you have fun with your little brother when you went to Busan last time?
I had a great time
There were so many unforgettable memories haha
When was the last time you went on a trip with your family?
I went to Jeju Island with my family a while ago~
Oh, I see. It must have been difficult to travel around during these difficult times. Didn't you get into any fights while traveling?
Yeah, it was so hot that I almost got a little annoyed, but we didn't fight!
If you have a younger sister, you share things like clothes, right?
Of course, since they are twins, they are the same age and have similar builds, so they even wear each other's clothes.
But they both hate each other so much Kiki. But are there more good points?
Yeah, I guess I might want to wear something, but they might not have it. Kiki
Still, I think it would be good to share a closet because you'd have more clothes to choose from!
I don't have a sister so I'm jealous of that.
But even if you're an older brother, don't you all wear older brother's clothes at least once?
Even if the size is big, there must be clothes that can be worn in their own way, right?
Yeah, you can wear something like a short-sleeved T-shirt in a boxy way!
But there are no shoes or bags or anything like that...
Are you wearing your brother's too?
I can't wear it now because I don't live with my brother, but I think I wore it a lot when I was a student.
Just some thick clothes or something?
Yeah, you can wear a man-to-man or a hoodie!
It was your mother's birthday recently. What did you give her as a present?
Um, I gave you cash this time
My parents said that's what they like the most
I gave you a big 500,000 won haha
Is this kind of gift okay?
Yeah, cash is better than a gift you don't like~
It's not very practical, but he likes it when I give him flowers sometimes!
I gave it to her on Parents' Day, and she liked it more than I expected, so I was surprised. I thought I should give it to her often.
Is there a memorable gift you gave to your parents?
My dad likes alcohol, so I bought him some expensive liquor and he liked it. It's not good for Kiki's health, but~
I'm going to save up more money to buy you another nice gift! What do you have besides cash?
I used to spend more on eating out than on gifts, but now I have to give cash.
Have you been to a wedding recently?
No, I don't have one because there's no one around me who's married these days.
There's one this month too, but I don't plan on going. If I go, I think I'll want to get married!
Really? Even in these times, I have a lot of friends who secretly get married!
I think everyone endured it for a while last year, but now that there is no sign of the coronavirus ending, they are just giving up.
Oh really?
How many people did it?
There's one this month and one next month!
There are still a lot of weddings early next year, but I don't know if I'll be able to attend them all.
Do all those friends date for a long time and get married?
I think it usually takes about a year to date!
When you date, do you usually stay in relationships for a long time?
I've been wanting to meet you for a long time, but it doesn't seem to be going well.
It's so hard to meet the right person.
How many times have you dated and been married?
I've been seeing him for about two and a half years~
Are you interested in going on a blind date?
It didn't exist in the past, but I think it's time to do something like that now Kiki
Want to introduce me?
Yeah, if you have any thoughts, you should look it up~!
What age difference is okay?
I don't mind as long as they're not younger, but I think up to 5 years old would be good.
How is that handsome guy you mentioned last time? ^^
Kiki, are you interested in him?
He has a pretty face but his personality is not that great~
Oh really?
I was tempted because they said he was handsome, but if his personality is bad, I won't be able to meet him.
Oh, that's too bad
Have you met many people whose personalities match yours?
Yeah, I think most people meet based on personality rather than appearance.
And I think height is more important than face!
Stop looking at my face
I don't see your face much.
A man is a character!
I really want to raise a puppy these days.
Oh me too! I really want to hold that puppy in my arms.
Is this a situation where you can't raise it?
There are so many things to take care of when raising a child.
And later on, I got sick and this also hurt my heart ㅠㅠ
But wouldn't the happiness be much greater while raising them?
I can't raise the child because there aren't many people at home and it's obvious the child will be left alone.
Yeah, that's something I'm also concerned about.
I don't think it's right to leave the dog home alone all day ㅠㅠ
Have you ever raised fish?
I've only seen friends raise fish, but I've never raised one myself.
I thought about raising one when I went to the aquarium haha
But don't you think about it when you go?
That's true!
These days, there are cafes that have aquariums installed so you can see the fish and even buy them.
Fish cafe! I think there are a few.
Didn't you have any friends who raised unusual animals when you were young?
I had a friend who had a parrot, and it would come out of its cage and run around the house, so I was a little scared.
Were you among your friends?
I was there too
I still remember the ferret that I raised because it was a mustelid. Kiki
Do you know that animal?
I've heard of it, but I don't think I've ever actually seen it.
I think it would be cute? Haha
I showed him the picture and he said it was good enough to be my pet.
Kiki, you look really cute
So I also wanted to raise one at one time
I see
Besides a dog, is there any other animal you would like to raise?
Well, there are many things I want to try growing
After watching I Live Alone, I wanted to raise a hedgehog too. It was so cute haha
Hamsters are common, but I've never raised one before and would like to try raising one. What about you?
I raised a hamster when I was little!
But it doesn't act as cute as a puppy, so if I were to raise it, I'd definitely choose a puppy!
After all, dogs are our nation's pets!
I've been going camping lately and it's been fun.
Oh well, the weather is nice these days so it's perfect for camping
I'm into fishing
Really? Don't you get seasick?
Oh, but instead of fishing in the ocean, I just throw my fishing rod on the land and do it! That's good because it helps me organize my thoughts.
Oh, freshwater fishing?
I think that would be good because it wouldn't make you motion sick!
Do you have a favorite fishing spot?
I don't know the exact name, but it's in Gangwon-do. I can't remember it haha
What other outdoor activities do you like?
These days, I go hiking sometimes!
I like hiking because it gives me a lot of exercise and I feel really refreshed after doing it.
How many hours does it take?
I think it takes about two or three hours!
It's the best if you get off and drink makgeolli
That's why I climb mountains.
Is there a mountain you often go to?
I often go to Cheonggyesan and Achasan~
Do you want to go to the mountain with the kids next time?
Okay, I really want to go
We can go when the weather gets a little cooler this weekend.
Until then, I'll work on my mountain climbing skills haha
Yeah yeah, build up some stamina~!
It's too hot now, so let's go around September.
It's going to get a bit cooler in September, so I think you'll want to do a lot of different things. Do you have any favorite sports?
I like watching baseball more than playing it!
I watched the Korea-Japan match yesterday and I was so sad because they lost ㅠㅠ
Did you see it too?
No, I don't know much about baseball, so I didn't know even after watching it. I'll watch it later!
You said your brother likes playing games, right?
Oh right, my younger sibling likes it too, but I actually like it too
I did this a lot when I was young
What games did you play mostly?
I used to play MapleStory, but I don't anymore~
What did you do?
I played Starcraft!
When we were kids, that game was really popular. Do you remember looking up broadcasts and stuff?
Yeah, I think that's what happened!
Among my friends, there was one who said he wanted to become a pro gamer.
Oh me too me too
Actually, there was someone who was preparing for that
When you were young, how many hours did you play at a time?
I think it took about two hours!
When I was in college, I played a game called Winning with my friends. Do you know this?
Oh, I've never heard of that before. Is it a computer game?
There was a PC room or arcade where you could play that game. Kiki
It was a soccer game, and that was fun too.
Ah, soccer games are really fun
There was a soccer game I always played when I went to the arcade. Is that the one?
Is this a game that you play for a long time once you start?
I think I did quite a bit!
I used to play games, but I hardly ever do these days.
You too?
Of course, since I don't have much time after going to work, I'm busy resting when I have time at home.
Yeah, but I still want to buy something like a PlayStation later and play it at home!
Oh, when I was little, I really wanted that too, so I begged my parents to buy it for me.
Do you have a favorite game character?
I like the character Adele!
Are you there?
No, I don't really have a favorite!
Where have you traveled abroad?
I've been to Kota Kinabalu and Vietnam.
you?
Oh, I want to go to Kota Kinabalu~
I've been backpacking around Europe for a month and have been to many places, but I've never been to Southeast Asia.
I recommend Southeast Asia because it has a friendly feel, is cheap, and is a great place to go and have fun without feeling burdened!
Yeah, I thought Southeast Asia was close enough that I could go there often, but I haven't been there yet haha
The food looks delicious too
Since food is a matter of taste, there are some things that are delicious and some that really don't suit me haha
So when you travel, do you tend to choose based on the famous local food?
I don't decide my travel destination by looking at things like that, but when I'm planning a trip, I first look for something delicious.
The most fun is going and eating delicious food.
Right, the fun of traveling is eating, so what else do you consider important? Like the history of each tourist attraction or the convenience of transportation!
History isn't that important, but it's important because it's easy to get around if transportation is convenient!
Do you tend to plan your trips in detail?
Not at all. I'm a bit spontaneous and like to go wherever I want, so I find it right away and go like this.
Are you the type of person who plans things out a bit?
I tend to make big plans and then adjust them to the situation when I go on a trip!
Do you prefer independent travel rather than package travel?
Yeah, I hate that I can't do whatever I want with packages.
It has no appeal to me at all, as I like to move around freely.
Have you tried the package?
Yeah, I went there but it wasn't that great.
When the coronavirus situation is over and we can travel abroad, where do you want to go first?
I want to go to America!
I've wanted to go there since I was little, but I couldn't go because it was too expensive and it was so big that I was scared.
Have you been to America?
Yeah, I've been to America!
It's good, so definitely go~!
Do you want to go west or east?
Let's definitely go later!
It feels so hot these days ㅠㅠ
Yes, I wish the tropics would go away now.
I think I often get headaches because I turn on the air conditioner too much.
Yeah, but it seems like it'd be a little less hot if it rained...
Do you like rainy days?
Yeah I really like rainy days
Even when I'm outside, sometimes I get rained on and stuff like that
Don't you get a little excited when it rains?
Yeah, that's right~ There's a special atmosphere that only rainy days have!
But it's not a good idea for a typhoon to come, right, Kiki
The typhoon is not bad, it's really bad haha
Do you remember when I was in college, there was a really bad typhoon that uprooted trees and stuff?
Oh, that's right. Gangnam Station was a sea of water and it was chaos. Even the mountains collapsed.
Oh, that one wasn't a joke either
Was there any damage to the house?
Yeah, thankfully nothing happened!
Have you seen the sky that was so pretty when it rained recently? The pink sky
You see, there was a pink sky and a day with a pretty rainbow.
I feel so good when the sky is pretty
That's right, it was a pink sky day and everyone was taking pictures!
It's so hot these days, I wish fall would come quickly.
I'm so sick of the heat that I want to feel the autumn breeze
What comes to mind when you think of fall?
Trench coat? Kiki
But it's always a shame that fall is so short that I have to put things back in the closet after wearing them once or twice.
Oh, I can't forget the trench coat.
I remember the rustling sound of fallen leaves underfoot. You know how nice that feels?
Oh right! I like that too
But I hate it when banks fail
Yeah, I really hated it because it smelled so bad
They said we're going to adjust the social distancing level again on the 6th. What do you think will happen?
I think stage 4 will be extended
But I think it should be like that
you?
Right. Even if we do level 4 now, confirmed cases are still coming out, so if we lower it to level 3, I think it will get worse.
That's right. The number of people who have been vaccinated is not that high. If we lower the rate, our quarantine powerhouse will disappear.
Are you planning to get vaccinated?
Yeah, I'm thinking about doing that
you?
I'm worried about the side effects, so I'm not going to get it yet. There have been cases where healthy people died. What should I do?
Well, since there is nothing verified, it is scary to actually try it.
By the way, did you hear that there was a mass food poisoning incident at a kimbap restaurant in Bundang?
Yeah I heard that too
That was a bit harsh
How could that be possible when dozens of people were involved in a group?
The owner probably knew about it, right?
You didn't know, did you?
We eat kimbap every day, but we have to be careful when we eat it.
Yeah, I was eating it today and it reminded me of that
It's hot so you really have to be careful
Have you watched the Olympics this time?
Yeah, I watched a few games!
I was watching baseball yesterday and I thought we were going to win after tying the game.
But because of a mistake, we lost 5 to 2 ㅠㅠ
It's such a pity
I don't know how to watch baseball, so I didn't watch it at all. I watched volleyball, but there were some touching scenes.
Did you see that?
Oh, I haven't seen it, I've only heard about it!
I think the players are really great, right?
Yeah, I think our country might have become a bit more famous thanks to these Olympics!
Yes, there isn't much time left, I hope everyone returns safely!
Let's cheer hard for the rest too
Yeah yeah let's definitely cheer!
In the US, there are even companies that pay you if you get vaccinated.
Oh really?
Why don't we do that?
Is it because there are many people who feel aversion to it?
I guess so
Because America is so wrong
I think they're giving money to increase vaccination rates
I wish they had been more thorough with post-vaccination management beforehand.
That's why Apple decided to increase the number of Chinese components in the iPhone 13.
Why did you do that?
I'm a little disappointed with Apple.
It's time for me to change my phone. Should I switch to Samsung?
Well, I do like iPhones more than Samsung phones.
I'm used to it now, so I think the iPhone is better.
Oh, did you see that Bill Gates and his wife got divorced?
Yeah, the assets are worth over 170 trillion won.
It's an unimaginable amount of money.
I don't know how the property will be divided. I wish they would give me a little bit of the property. Haha.
Yeah, really, even if you take it off to some extent, it won't be noticeable
But don't you think our country's status has risen somewhat because of Corona?
Yeah, that's right. Compared to other countries, we handled it really well in the beginning!
It's just like that now, Kiki
I think the biggest mistake was not blocking overseas arrivals, but I think the Olympics also played a part this time.
If we had blocked overseas arrivals, there would have been people who would have made a fuss about it.
I hope it all ends soon
I hope it gets finished quickly in other countries too
I'm going to the hair salon this weekend to get my hair done!
Oh really?
What are you going to do?
It's hot these days, so should I just cut my hair short?
Oh good good
I think you'll look great together
Have you heard that a lot?
Yeah, I've heard a few times that short hair suits you better~
My friend recently got botox in his jaw. Should I get it too?
Have you seen what happened to your friend?
I think I'm doing pretty well these days, but I can't get it right away because I'm worried that there might be side effects.
Yeah, I saw it and it looks like he lost weight and became really thin!
It's not a major surgery, so I think it'll be okay?
Once you start getting botox, you'll want to do everything else, right?
I want to put on aegyo sal
Oh... what if I become like a caterpillar?
Thanks for the advice...^^
So, is there any other cosmetic procedure you would like to try?
I tried shrinking and it seemed to be effective, so I'm going to try that again!
Oh, I wonder if we can meet up later
Have you had any skin care?
I used to get it sometimes, but not these days~
I think I need to start managing it little by little now
Have you ever thought about getting plastic surgery?
Yeah, I don't like that because it's a bit scary ㅠㅠ
I'm scared too, but I'd do it if it made me pretty Kiki
I had a health checkup recently, and I was so tired after doing it.
But I'm glad it doesn't hurt too much
That's really fortunate, I have a lot of sore spots so that's the problem ㅠㅠ
I guess I'm really old
Really? What don't you like?
I feel like it's getting worse and worse
It's indigestible and makes me nauseous. I heard you have a weak stomach too?
Yeah, it wasn't like this before, but my digestive power has been getting worse.
I need to work out harder and be careful about what I eat~
I need to eat well, but it's hard to take care of it.
What do you do to manage your health?
I can't improve my eating habits by just exercising and taking supplements.
But I need to go to the dentist regularly, but I keep putting it off and not going.
If you neglect dental care, you will suffer later and lose a lot of money.
When I was young, my parents made me brush my teeth very diligently!
Oh really? I think I'm the type that rots easily.
And I think my teeth got weaker because I had braces before ㅠㅠ
Then I should go to the dentist even more diligently.
Are you not going because it hurts?
It's not like that, but I don't want to take the time to go.
Do you go regularly?
I don't go to the dentist at all
Of course I have rotten teeth, but I'm holding on by brushing my teeth thoroughly since there's no pain yet haha
Yeah, it's uncomfortable, but if it's not there, I guess you're managing it well~!
If you try to treat it later, it will cost a lot of money, so brush your teeth diligently.
Yeah, that's right
You should go to the dentist right now, Kiki.
Yeah, I guess I'll have to make a reservation for next week!
You should go there early when you have time~
Definitely go before it gets any worse!
I tried to buy a one-piece dress at the mall yesterday, but it was too expensive, so I just didn't buy it.
These days, since it's summer, there are a lot of places that are offering discounts on one-piece dresses.
What style of clothes were you wearing?
It was a little loose, but it came just above the knees!
It's clothes from a shopping mall, and they cost over 100,000 won.
Wow, really? It's so expensive.
Looking at the price, it doesn't seem to be Coupang. Is it a brand name clothing?
No, I don't know about that, I just kept pressing it and it came out, and it's pretty!
Have you bought anything at the mall recently?
I bought sandals
I bought it to wear daily in the summer, and I like it because it's good for this price haha
Oh, it's cheap and good? And is it comfortable on your feet?
Yeah, the heel is just right and I bought it after reading people's reviews.
I've only worn them for a day but they seem fine
What have you bought recently?
I just bought 3 short sleeve t-shirts to wear this summer!
Oh, three each?
Well, there's nothing better than a light short-sleeved T-shirt for summer.
Is this just a shopping mall that came up through a search?
Yeah, shopping malls in ZigZag! It was nice that the delivery came in one day.
Oh, I also use zigzag a lot
It was so convenient because there were so many pretty things gathered together!
Isn't it convenient because you don't have to search each shopping mall individually and they're all gathered together?
Yeah, I think it's so convenient that I keep coming back to it.
Which shopping mall do you frequent often?
I think I mostly buy clothes from ZigZag and everything else from Coupang!
you?
I'm just going to use zigzag~
Have you ever thought you couldn't be number one?
That's so funny Kiki
But I don't watch it properly, but I watch it occasionally when I find it again.
You like that?
It's fun to watch sometimes
It's so funny because they're comedians
Yeah, I remember laughing a lot too, and my younger sibling liked it too.
Right? I think Kang Jae-jun's is the funniest.
Do you have a favorite comedian?
I like Jang Do-yeon
Your gag style is so my style hahaha
They were fun too, they're a couple of friends
Yeah, that's right
I also think that among female comedians, Jang Do-yeon is the funniest and the one who keeps the lead while telling gags!
What other entertainment programs do you watch?
I don't think there is any entertainment show like I Live Alone
It's a program that's been around for a long time, but it's still holding on to the top spot.
Oh, right, tomorrow is the day?
On and Off was similar to I Live Alone and was fun, but they don't do that anymore.
Oh, you know that?
I liked on and off too
Yeah, it's really similar, but the atmosphere is a bit different
Whose side did you enjoy watching?
I think Yuna and Lee Ji Ah's side was fun!
you?
Well, I haven't seen it all.
I enjoyed the one with IU and Jiyeon and the one with Kim Dongwan was also good. Did you watch it?
Oh right, I watched the IU and Jiyeon episode!
I haven't seen Kim Dong-wan's episode, but is it fun?
Kim Dong-wan appeared several times, but I just liked him and found it fun.
I liked mythology when I was young haha
Oh I liked Shinhwa too, I liked Jeon Jin haha
Mythology is good for everyone
They were all incredibly popular!
Do you have a favorite film director?
I just know a few famous directors, but I don't really like any of them haha
I'm more interested in the actors than the director.
Which director do you like?
I like director Bong Joon-ho~
So who do you like to learn from?
I like Ha Jung-woo and Hyun Bin, and there are quite a few, but do you have a favorite actor?
I like Ha Jung-woo too!
I like foreign films as well as Korean films. What do you think?
Foreign movies are good, there are definitely a lot of masterpieces.
What foreign movie have you seen recently?
I saw Cruella and it was fun
Have you seen this movie?
Oh I saw that too. It was really funny.
So I think it would be good to watch it again!
By the way, how about zombie movies? Do you like them?
Oh, I really like zombie stuff. I go out of my way to look for it and watch it. Haha
Have you seen the movie Dawn of the Dead?
No, I've heard of it.
I don't like scary movies ㅠㅠ
Well, that doesn't seem right.
I was planning to watch the movie this weekend since it was recommended to me, but then you don't like zombie movies?
Yeah, I'm so surprised my heart hurts.
I just like bright and cheerful movies!
I guess you like things like Roco, right?
Yeah, that's right, I like that kind of thing!
I like mystery too, as long as it's not too surprising or scary!
Do you like mystery stories?
Yeah, I really like it too
Recommend me some good movies later!
What are you having for lunch today?
I think I'll eat at the convenience store today too
It's so hot these days that I feel like I'm going to die after eating at a restaurant ㅠㅠ
What would you like to eat today?
It's so hot today that I think I'll have to eat at the convenience store.
What kind of convenience store food would you like to eat?
I'm thinking of something simple like bread or cup ramen.
What do you usually drink when you eat bread?
I always seem to drink banana milk when I eat at convenience stores.
Do you usually eat ramen often?
I didn't really eat ramen, but I think I've been eating it a lot lately.
Do you like ramen?
On the other hand, I really liked ramen, but I don't think I've been eating it much lately.
Do you have a favorite convenience store food?
I like triangle kimbap
It looks easy to eat and delicious
Do you have a favorite convenience store food?
I like simple things like sandwiches or burgers.
What is your favorite food?
My favorite food is pork rinds
It tastes so good when eaten with alcohol.
Do you have a favorite snack to go with your drinks?
I don't think I have a favorite snack to go with my drinks.
I don't drink much haha
How much can you drink?
I don't know the exact amount
Do you not drink alcohol or does your body not accept it?
No, it's not that I have any health problems, but since I don't eat it, I don't really think about it or feel like drinking it haha
I'm like that these days too
These days, I just drink beer before going to bed and I feel better because I can sleep well.
Do you like soju, beer, or other alcohol?
I like fruity beers.
What kind of alcohol do you like?
I used to like soju, but these days I think I like fruity beers Kiki
What do you think about real estate policy?
I think real estate policy is going in the wrong direction.
What do you think about real estate policy?
It made me realize that a wrong policy can cause this much damage.
Now I'm really scared that my dream of owning a home is gone.
Yes, me too
It's so complicated, policies change every day, and ordinary people have a lot of problems with taxes and things like that, it's giving me a headache ㅠ
I'm thinking that I should go ahead and buy a house right now.
Are you planning to buy a home?
I have no idea yet
I have a headache just thinking about it, I guess I just can't bring myself to think about that part yet
If you buy a home, where do you plan to do it?
Seoul has gone up so much that I think we should go to Gyeonggi.
Some experts are saying that there is a huge bubble in real estate prices, so I am hesitant and really don't know what to do.
Yes, originally, when I buy, it goes down, and when others buy, it goes up, but I don't think it will go down anymore. Later, when we get older, the population will decrease a lot. I think there will be a surplus of houses at that time.
This is a really big problem.
When you get married later, what do you plan to do with your house: rent, lease, or buy?
I'm thinking about renting it out for now
I'm thinking about living in a rented house and buying a house when my circumstances improve.
** What are you going to do?
I heard that the price of rent is not cheap these days.
I'm going to try to trade even if it means pushing myself, but I have to do it according to the situation.
If you were to buy, would you prefer a house or an apartment?
I think it would be a good idea to start with an apartment.
I'm trying to apply for a housing subscription, but these days, they say winning the lottery subscription is like trying to catch a star in the sky.
I should also take an interest in that kind of thing ㅠ
Where do you plan to buy a house when you get married?
I would like to live in Seoul if possible, but I am thinking of moving closer to my workplace.
