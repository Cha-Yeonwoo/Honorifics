# Honorific-Aware English-to-Korean Translation

This repository contains the official implementation of KAIST CS475 NLP Project.

Our method combines a **Honorific Model** and a **Translator Model** to enhance English-to-Korean translation by accurately predicting and incorporating honorificness into translations.

## Features
- **Honorific Detection**: Predict the appropriate honorific level in Korean conversations using a Transformer-based model.
- **Context-Aware Translation**: Generate translations that reflect cultural nuances and speaker dynamics.
- **LoRA Fine-Tuning**: Parameter-efficient training for adapting large language models (LLMs).
